"CURRICULUM FOR FATHERS: HEALTHY FAMILIES, STRONG COMMUNITIES",https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HFSC-curriculum-Fathers-English.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is the Curriculum for Fathers, jointly developed by Equimundo and SEED Foundation, with support from the United States Department of State. It is an innovative program that centers a family approach to healthy relationships, gender norms, and positive parenting techniques. The curriculum has been specifically adapted for the context of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) in 2022.
Target Audience and Goals
The curriculum is intended to be facilitated to fathers with adolescent sons aged 15-19. Although separate fathers' and sons’ curricula exist, the overall program aims to engage both groups to reduce intergenerational violence and foster caring and supportive relationships within the family. The program is implemented in KRI, engaging Kurdish host community members, Iraqi internally displaced persons (IDPs), and the Syrian refugee population. It is adapted from Program H, which focuses on engaging youth in critical reflections on gender and helping them build skills for more empowered and equitable ways of acting.
Curriculum Structure and Key Themes
The curriculum consists of ten sessions, each designed with specific objectives, activities, discussion questions, and a weekly commitment for participants to apply lessons in their daily lives.
Key themes covered across the sessions include:
• Gender and Roles: Understanding the influence of male authority figures, discussing the difference between sex and gender, reflecting on gender norms, and exploring attitudes about men’s and women’s roles in the home and society (Session 2).
• Emotions and Conflict: Helping participants identify anger and express it nonviolently, discussing the difficulties men face in expressing emotions, and practicing nonviolent conflict resolution techniques (Sessions 3, 6).
• Violence and Power: Identifying different types of violence (physical, emotional, sexual, social, economic), discussing the link between past experiences of violence and the violence one inflicts on others, increasing awareness of power dynamics in relationships, and discussing the advantages of equitable decision-making (Sessions 4, 5).
• Honor Violence: Critically examining honor killings and honor-based violence, how they relate to masculinity, and exploring ways to challenge these harmful norms within families and the community (Session 7).
• Family Communication and Vision: Reflecting on the importance of communication and affection, developing effective communication skills between parents and young people (Session 8, sometimes facilitated with fathers and sons together), and crafting a shared family vision and long-term goals (Session 8).
• Positive Parenting: Making connections between parenting goals and how harsh discipline affects them, and providing fathers with positive parenting techniques, including giving praise and expressing love (Session 9).
• Sustaining Change: Reflecting on positive changes made and preparing family action plans to sustain and reinforce these changes (Session 10).
Facilitation Approach
Facilitators are instructed to act as guides, promoting reflection and participatory learning rather than lecturing. They are advised to use process questions that encourage deeper thought, create a safe and respectful environment, and be prepared to address sensitive and complex topics, including having resources available for referrals to professional services like counseling.","• Fathers

"CURRICULUM FOR YOUTH: HEALTHY FAMILIES, STRONG COMMUNITIES",https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HFSC-curriculum-Youth-English.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document outlines a detailed curriculum intended for adolescent boys aged 15-19, jointly developed by Equimundo and The SEED Foundation, with support from the United States Department of State. The curriculum has been specifically adapted for the context of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) in 2022.
Program Goals and Audience
The innovative program centers a family approach to gender norms, healthy relationships, and positive parenting techniques. Although this is a separate curriculum designed for young men, the overall program engages with both fathers and their adolescent sons to reduce intergenerational violence and foster healthy, caring, and supportive family relationships. The program aims to sensitize young men to harmful socialization patterns and help them act in more empowered and equitable ways. Participants include Kurdish host community members, Iraqi internally displaced persons (IDPs), and the Syrian refugee population in KRI.
Curriculum Structure and Key Themes
The curriculum consists of nine core sessions (plus an alternative session). Each session follows a standardized format, including objectives, key activities, suggested timing, required materials, key messages, and group discussion questions.
Key thematic areas explored across the sessions include:
• Masculinity and Gender Roles (Session 1): Sessions introduce participants to the group, establish a safe environment, and encourage them to understand the impact and costs of rigid forms of masculinity and gender roles on men's and women's lives.
• Family Influence and History (Session 2): Participants reflect on the influence of fathers, mothers, and other authority figures, seeking to replicate positive aspects while addressing negative patterns.
• Power Dynamics (Session 3): The curriculum addresses how factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, and other characteristics influence how much power individuals have in society, and how that power can restrict their progress. The concept of ""power over"" systems, including patriarchy, is discussed.
• Violence and Emotions (Sessions 4 & 5): Participants identify different types of violence (physical, emotional, sexual, social, and economic). The curriculum treats violence as a learned behavior that is not innate, meaning it can be eliminated. Participants are encouraged to identify ways they can express anger through nonviolent means, recognizing that anger is a natural emotion but violence is a behavior.
• Relationships and Intervention (Sessions 6 & 7): Sessions focus on naming characteristics of healthy and unhealthy relationships and practicing bystander intervention to safely and effectively prevent and interrupt sexist behaviors, violence, and conflict in the community.
• Communication and Future Goals (Sessions 8 & 9): Session 8 focuses on the importance of communication and affection, sometimes facilitated with sons and fathers together. The final session helps young men reflect on their identities, construct life plans, prepare for possible obstacles, and appreciate the positive changes they have made.
Facilitator Guidance
Facilitators are instructed to act as guides, not teachers. Their role is to promote reflection and participatory learning in a safe, non-judgmental environment. Due to the sensitive and complex themes, facilitators must be prepared to address issues like sexual trauma, understand their agency's mandatory reporting requirements, and have a list of professional services (like counseling) for referrals. A key tool used to foster change is the Weekly Commitment, a specific task participants take on to incorporate lessons into their daily lives.","Youth Curriculum

BRIEF 1. Parenting programmes to reduce violence against children and women: Why it is important,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brief-1-Parenting-Programs-Why-it-is-important.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document, Brief 1, argues that parenting and caregiver support programmes are in a unique position to reduce violence within the family, specifically violence against children (VAC) and violence against their mothers or female caregivers (VAW).
Context and Focus
The brief was developed by UNICEF Innocenti, Prevention Collaborative, and Equimundo. It is intended for practitioners implementing parenting programs. The series intentionally highlights parenting programmes because they are already reaching parents and caregivers in many communities and can be strengthened to reduce violence and promote gender equality.
The brief focuses on the most common forms of violence that often co-occur in families: violent discipline by parents (VAC) and intimate partner violence (IPV) (VAW). Globally, three-quarters of children ages 2 to 4 experience violent discipline, and a third of women experience physical or sexual violence from a partner in their lifetime. The information primarily relates to programs for parents of young children but is applicable to parents of older children and adolescents as well.
Core Arguments for Intersectionality
The brief details why addressing both forms of violence simultaneously is crucial:
1. Compounded Negative Consequences: Both violent discipline and IPV are associated with negative impacts on children's health, development, and well-being. Exposure to violence can affect a child’s developing brain, leading to difficulties such as poor impulse control or aggression later in life. These negative impacts are compounded when children are exposed to multiple types of violence.
2. Intergenerational Cycle: Violence has long-term and intergenerational consequences. Children in violent homes may learn that violence is a normal way to resolve conflict, increasing their risk of becoming a perpetrator (for men) or a victim (for women) of violence in adulthood or of using violence against their own children.
3. Shared Risk Factors: VAC and VAW share common social and family risk factors, most significantly being rooted in gender inequality. Common social norms sustaining both forms of violence include those that support gender inequality, promote harmful masculinities based on violence and control, and condone the violent discipline of children and women.
4. Program Effectiveness: Failing to address both VAC and VAW is a missed opportunity, potentially undermining the desired outcomes of parenting programs. Emerging evidence suggests that parenting programs can reduce both VAC and VAW simultaneously, even if they were not explicitly designed to do so.
Gender-Transformative Approach
The brief champions a gender-transformative approach for parenting programs. These programs intentionally seek to address the root causes of gender-based inequalities and challenge harmful gender roles, norms, and power imbalances.
Gender-transformative programs work with both female and male parents and caregivers to:
• Promote critical reflection and discussion of unequal gender attitudes.
• Help parents identify the benefits of more equitable ways of being.
• Strengthen relationship and parenting skills (e.g., conflict resolution, emotional self-regulation, and nonviolent discipline).
• Increase men's participation in childcare and household tasks.
• Promote equitable relationships where partners share responsibility and power in decision-making.","• Parenting Programmes

BRIEF 2. Parenting programmes to reduce violence against children and women: What gender-transformative programmes look like,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brief-2-Parenting-Programs-What-gender-transformative-programs-look-like.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document, Brief 2, is the second in a series designed to provide parenting practitioners with evidence-based insights to support the adaptation and strengthening of existing parenting programmes. Its central focus is exploring the practical elements—principles, delivery characteristics, and content—of gender-transformative parenting programmes (GTPPs) that effectively reduce violence in the family.
Rationale and Gender-Transformative Approach
Parenting programmes are in a unique position to reduce violence against children (VAC) (specifically violent discipline) and violence against women (VAW) (specifically intimate partner violence, or IPV) because these types of violence often co-occur and share common risk factors rooted in gender inequality.
GTPPs are defined as those that intentionally seek to address and challenge the root causes of gender-based inequalities and harmful gender roles, norms, and power imbalances. They work with both female and male parents and caregivers to promote more caring, equitable, and nonviolent family dynamics. These programs aim to transform parents' gender attitudes and behaviors, improve couple relations, and build essential skills like communication, emotional self-regulation, conflict resolution, and nonviolent discipline.
Common Principles and Delivery Features
Effective GTPPs share several guiding principles:
• Gender Equality: They are grounded in women’s rights and promote gender equality as both a goal and a pathway to violence prevention.
• Engaging Men: They explicitly engage men as equitable parents and caregivers, recognizing men are the primary perpetrators of IPV and that unequal relationship dynamics are risk factors for both VAC and VAW. Programs appeal to men positively, focusing on their desire to be better parents.
• Community Involvement: They engage communities, including parents, children, and stakeholders, early in the design or adaptation process to ensure relevance, obtain buy-in, and mitigate potential backlash.
• Strengths-Based Approach: Programs do not focus on telling parents they are failing but highlight the benefits of participation, such as achieving happier, more peaceful families and stronger relationships.
• Safety and Rights: They prioritize women’s and children’s safety by developing adequate safeguarding policies, monitoring implementation, and providing referrals to support services.
In terms of delivery, GTPPs:
• Use structured curricula with at least 10 regular sessions, based on theories of change that allow time for reflection and practice (often through a Weekly Commitment).
• Train peer or community-based facilitators (often including male facilitators to appeal to men) who receive adequate training on gender norms and referral services.
• Combine single-sex sessions (for open discussion) with mixed-sex sessions (couples’ sessions) to foster communication and shared aspirations.
• Use participatory approaches (e.g., group discussion, role-play) rather than lecturing, fostering a safe and supportive environment for critical reflection.
Core Curriculum Content
The content of GTPPs commonly includes activities designed to:
• Promote reflection on gender norms and power imbalances and the costs of adhering to inequitable norms.
• Raise awareness of violence (including its manifestation and consequences) and how social norms justify it.
• Build couple relationship skills like communication, active listening, and conflict resolution, including discussions about sharing household decisions and responsibilities.
• Strengthen positive parenting skills, emphasizing emotional closeness, responsive care, and nonviolent techniques for managing children’s behavior.
• Build parents’ skills to manage strong emotions like anger or frustration to reduce the risk of using violence.
• Promote more equitable family dynamics, specifically men’s equal participation in childcare and household tasks.
• Encourage reflection on participants' own childhoods to break harmful intergenerational patterns.
• Promote positive gender socialization to support raising children free from gender stereotypes.
• Address responsible relationships with alcohol, a known risk factor for violence.
• Foster family, peer, and community support to enable and sustain behavior change.","Gender-Transformative Parenting Programmes (GTPPs)

BRIEF 3. Parenting programmes to reduce violence against children and women: How to adapt programmes to address both types of violence,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Brief-3-Parenting-Programs-How-to-adapt-programs-to-address-both-types-of-violence.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document, Brief 3, is the third in a series providing guidance to parenting practitioners who want to strengthen or adapt their existing parenting programs to integrate violence prevention and gender equality. The guidance focuses on tackling the most common forms of violence that often co-occur in families: violent discipline (Violence Against Children, or VAC) and intimate partner violence (IPV) (Violence Against Women, or VAW).
Gender-Transformative Approach and Goals
The brief is based on the premise that effective programs take a gender-transformative approach, meaning they intentionally challenge unequal gender norms and power dynamics to promote more equitable, caring, and nonviolent family dynamics. These adaptations aim to transform parents' gender attitudes, improve couple relations, and build essential skills like communication, emotional self-regulation, conflict resolution, and nonviolent discipline. This process is intended to unlock parents' potential to provide care and raise their children free from gender stereotypes.
The Five Stages of Adaptation
The core of the brief proposes an iterative and participatory approach organized into five stages, designed to guide practitioners through the adaptation process:
1. Gain organisational and stakeholder buy-in: This initial stage requires securing sufficient time and resources. Practitioners must get staff and management on board, especially regarding integrating violence prevention and engaging men. It also involves engaging external actors (like women’s organizations or government representatives) and identifying, mitigating, and monitoring potential backlash or risks (e.g., increased violence) that challenging deeply entrenched gender norms may create for participants.
2. Consult parents and understand gender and violence in your context: This stage requires consulting existing research on the prevalence and drivers of VAC and VAW and conducting formative research with parents, children (where feasible), and community leaders. Consultation is necessary to identify local norms, understand barriers to participation (like work schedules or childcare needs), and explore opportunities and strategies for engaging fathers.
3. Adapt your programme recruitment, content, and design: This involves three major areas:
    ◦ Content: Integrating critical reflection on gender and power dynamics throughout the curriculum, raising awareness of different types of violence, and discussing how violence undermines family relationships and goals. Content should be strengthened with skill-building activities in couple communication, conflict resolution, and positive parenting practices.
    ◦ Session Format: Deciding whether to use single-sex or mixed-sex/couples' sessions, based on context, participant preference, and potential risks, recognizing that separate sessions might be safer for sensitive topics like IPV or alcohol abuse.
    ◦ Recruitment: Revising messaging to resonate with and clearly invite both mothers and fathers/couples.
4. Test and refine your adapted programme: Practitioners must test revised recruitment strategies and messaging, and pilot the full curriculum with a small group of parents or facilitators before a full rollout.
5. Train and adequately support facilitators to successfully implement: This final stage involves assessing facilitator capacity, potentially including (more) male facilitators to work with fathers, and providing sufficient training (often 10 days) on the program rationale and sensitive issues like gender norms and violence. Crucially, clear referral processes to support services must be designed, and facilitators must receive supportive supervision, check-ins on their well-being, and guidance on navigating disclosures of violence. Session timing and locations must be accessible for participants, even if outside regular working hours.","• Parenting Programmes

BRIEF 4. Parenting programmes to reduce violence against children and women: How to measure change,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/How-to-measure-change-brief-4.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document, Brief 4, is a guide for parenting practitioners on how to effectively monitor and evaluate (M&E) their programs after they have been adapted to integrate gender equality and violence prevention. The brief focuses on measuring change related to violent discipline (Violence Against Children, VAC) and intimate partner violence (IPV) (Violence Against Women, VAW), which often co-occur and share risk factors rooted in unequal gender norms and power dynamics.
Monitoring (M) Emphasis and Risks
Monitoring is defined as the systematic process of collecting, analyzing, and using information to track progress and make ""real-time"" changes. The brief stresses that monitoring is critical immediately following program adaptation to ensure that modifications—which take a gender-transformative approach—are implemented as intended.
The brief outlines eight key domains for monitoring implementation:
1. Staff and Facilitator Training and Support: Assessing whether staff are equipped with the necessary knowledge and confidence to implement gender-transformative content.
2. Impact on Staff/Facilitators: Measuring changes in facilitators' own attitudes about gender and violence, as well as monitoring their well-being, stress, and potential backlash.
3. Reach, Attendance, and Retention: Tracking how many participants (disaggregated by sex/gender identity) attend and complete the program, especially noting challenges in engaging men.
4. Implementation Quality and Fidelity: Ensuring that facilitators adhere to the curriculum content, key messaging on gender equality, and the core gender-transformative principles.
5. Acceptability and Resonance: Gathering feedback from participants and community stakeholders on how the adapted program is perceived.
6. Referral to Additional Services: Tracking how many participants are referred to support services (e.g., legal, health, psychosocial) and whether the referral pathways are functioning.
7. Mandatory Reporting Obligations: Tracking reports made to authorities and assessing any potential consequences or negative impacts on children or female caregivers.
8. Potential Risks and Unintended Consequences: Actively monitoring for adverse events, such as increased violence or community backlash, and documenting risk mitigation strategies.
Evaluation (E) and Ethical Considerations
Evaluation systematically assesses the program's impact, usually by comparing outcomes over time or between groups. For effective evaluation, plans must align with the program's theory of change, and data should be disaggregated by sex or gender identity.
Qualitative research (e.g., in-depth interviews) is highly recommended alongside quantitative data to illuminate the mechanisms of change and explore why certain outcomes were or were not achieved.
The brief emphasizes that researching VAC and VAW carries unique ethical and safety challenges, requiring practitioners to prioritize participant safety and follow international ethical guidelines. Data collectors must be specially trained on gender, violence, confidentiality, referral processes, and how to manage distress and potential vicarious trauma.
Key Outcomes to Measure
To assess the impact of gender-transformative adaptations, the brief highlights several key outcomes practitioners should measure, using validated tools where possible:
• Attitudes: Changes in attitudes about gender roles, the division of household tasks, the acceptance of IPV, and the physical punishment of children.
• Violence Perpetration/Experience: Reductions in VAC perpetration (e.g., using MICS discipline module) and IPV experience or perpetration (e.g., using WHO Multi-Country Study items).
• Couple Relations: Improvements in the frequency and quality of couple communication and relationship closeness, as well as co-parenting relations.
• Power Dynamics: Shifts toward more equitable decision-making and a more equitable division of labor (increasing men's participation in childcare and household tasks).
• Shared Risk Factors: Changes in factors that drive violence, such as caregiver mental health (depression/anxiety) and alcohol consumption.","• Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

"Creating Peace: A Curriculum Promoting Healing, Nonviolence, Racial Justice, and Gender Equity Among Adolescents",https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Creating-Peace_curriculum.pdf,"Summary of the Source
The Creating Peace curriculum is a detailed, gender-transformative methodology designed primarily for high school-age youth of all genders, ranging from the ages 14 to 19. It is anchored in an intersectional feminist approach that recognizes that systems of power impact the most marginalized members of society.
Core Philosophy and Origin
The curriculum is a rare example of an approach from the Global South informing and inspiring approaches in the Global North. It was specifically inspired by similar curricula from the Living Peace Institute in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where Equimundo has partnered for years. The approach emerged as a critique of individualistic violence prevention efforts, emphasizing that while individual support (like counseling) is necessary, healing from trauma and violence is also a collective effort.
The curriculum is rooted in understanding how gender norms (such as expecting boys to ""play through the pain"" or girls to ""put up with certain forms of violence"") affect trauma recovery and contribute to violence perpetration. It recognizes that young people are not only victims of trauma but are also agents of change, uniquely positioned to be part of solutions and community transformation. The curriculum development included input from community members in the Pittsburgh region.
Goals and Intervention Components
The overarching goal is to decrease violence perpetration among the target population. This is achieved through five main objectives:
1. Establishing a safe space for addressing and healing from violence.
2. Promoting gender equity, positive relationship norms, and nonviolent attitudes.
3. Practicing positive relationship-building and bystander skills.
4. Building leadership skills to address racial and gender injustice nonviolently.
5. Engaging in ** community-based activism**.
The content specifically focuses on the relationships among gender inequity, racial injustice, and violence perpetration.
Structure and Themes
The curriculum is organized into 12 sessions, generally following the socio-ecological model (moving from individual reflection to interpersonal relationships and, finally, to community action). Sessions are structured with objectives, procedures, and group discussions. Core themes addressed include:
• Self-Identity: Defining sex assigned at birth, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation (Session 3).
• Emotions and Power: Exploring emotions, identifying how gender can make expressing emotions difficult (Session 4), and understanding power imbalances (Session 5).
• Relationships and Violence: Discussing healthy/unhealthy relationships, sexual consent (Session 6), and identifying forms of violence (physical, emotional, sexual, economic).
• Action and Community: Developing safe and effective bystander intervention techniques (Session 7), reflecting on future orientation and community goals (Session 8), and planning and executing a youth-led community organizing and activism event (Sessions 9, 10, 11).
Facilitation Approach
Facilitators are positioned as guides, not teachers. They must embrace a trauma-sensitive approach, prioritizing principles such as safety, trustworthiness, and empowerment. Crucially, facilitators must inform minor participants about mandatory reporting requirements for disclosures of abuse or harm. The curriculum also includes guidelines for adaptation, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation, with specific support for virtual delivery models.","• Creating Peace Curriculum

Program ABB-Early Childhood Development – A manual Promoting Positive Parenting and Strengthening Active Father’s Involvement in Early Childhood Development,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Program-ABB-EN-2024.pdf,"This document is the manual for Program ABB-Early Childhood Development (Program P-ECD), an initiative jointly developed by Equimundo and the ABAAD Organization. The Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA) in Lebanon adopted this program and plans to integrate it into its basket of social services at the national level.
Core Goals and Audience
The program is a gender-transformative methodology designed to be a flexible, scientific, and practical guide suited for the Lebanese cultural environment. Its overall goal is to enhance the role of fathers, making the Arabic term 'Abb' (father) synonymous with active, caring, and equal parenting.
The program targets male caregivers and couples (fathers and their partners) with a focus on children between the ages of 0 and 8 years. It specifically addresses the needs of vulnerable populations, including Syrian refugees residing in Lebanon, whose experiences of conflict and displacement have altered household dynamics and increased rates of domestic violence.
The curriculum seeks to challenge the severe global and local gender gap in unpaid care work, where women still spend significantly more time on housework and caregiving than men. The program advocates that when men take on a more equal role in the home, it strengthens women's empowerment and independence, and improves the health and well-being of the entire family.
Structure and Methodology
The manual contains thirteen basic group educational sessions and two supplementary sessions. Group education sessions are typically 1 to 2 hours long.
The methodology is rooted in gender consciousness (conscientization), encouraging participants to critically reflect on the history of cultural conditions and gender norms. It uses the Socio-Ecological Model to highlight that sustainable change requires interventions at the individual, relational, community, and societal levels. Effective implementation involves combining group education with youth-led campaigns, activism, and advocacy to influence public policies.
Key thematic areas explored in the sessions include:
• Gender and Masculinities: Examining individual attitudes, roles, double standards, and how restrictive gender norms (Man Box) affect men's emotional expression and relationships.
• Caregiving Roles: Reflecting on the intergenerational transmission of caregiving, comparing the daily routines of men and women to highlight disparities, and defining positive qualities in the Human Box that should apply to all parents regardless of gender.
• Power and Violence: Analyzing power dynamics in relationships, discussing the devaluation of housework, defining the cycle of violence, and practicing non-violent conflict resolution. Violence is presented as a learned behavior that can be unlearned.
• Positive Parenting and ECD: Establishing long-term parenting goals, promoting empathy by understanding stages of child development (0–3 years), learning to give specific praise, and using constructive consequences through positive parenting techniques.
• Support Systems: Encouraging men to build and rely on support networks, which is crucial as men are often socialized to be self-sufficient and never seek help.
Facilitators are positioned as guides, not teachers, whose role is to create a safe space, promote inclusion, manage time, and model equitable relationships if co-facilitating. Due to the sensitive nature of the topics, facilitators must be knowledgeable about referral services for psychosocial and trauma-focused support.","• Program ABB-ECD (Program P-ECD)

CORE ELEMENTS OF GENDER-TRANSFORMATIVE FATHERHOOD PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE CARE EQUALITY AND PREVENT VIOLENCE,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Program-P-Practitioner-FullReport.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is a systematic review and learning brief developed by Equimundo that consolidates evidence and practice-based knowledge from various adaptations of Program P around the world. Program P (""P"" for father in Portuguese and Spanish) was initially developed in 2011 as part of the MenCare campaign to promote men's positive involvement in fatherhood, caregiving, and maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH).
Methodology and Scope
The review drew on a rich body of evaluation research and practice-based knowledge from partners globally. The findings are primarily synthesized from eight rigorous case studies of Program P adaptations implemented in 12 countries across Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, Europe, and South Asia. The brief focuses specifically on the gender-transformative group education component of Program P for men and their partners, which is the central and most frequently evaluated part of the program.
Core Program Philosophy and Goals
Program P is a gender-transformative fatherhood program that aims to improve family well-being, strengthen couple relationships, and address the global gender gap in unpaid care work [6 P adaptations implemented in 12 countries across Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, Europe, and South Asia. The brief focuses specifically on the gender-transformative group education component of Program P for men and their partners, which is the central and most frequently evaluated part of the program.
Core Program Philosophy and Goals
Program P is a gender-transformative fatherhood program that aims to improve family well-being, strengthen couple relationships, and address the global gender gap in unpaid care work. The methodology is experiential and participatory, encouraging male caregivers and their partners to critically reflect on restrictive gender norms and power dynamics that contribute to violence. The ultimate goal is to reduce the intergenerational transmission of violence by promoting equitable and nonviolent attitudes and behaviors.
Key Evidence and Impact Areas
The review finds that Program P adaptations have significant potential to reduce violence and promote equitable family dynamics:
• Gender Attitudes and Norms: All eight programs demonstrated positive shifts in men’s and women’s gender attitudes, including greater awareness of the domestic burden on women and decreased endorsement of violence as a means to gain respect.
• Intimate Partner Violence (IPV): Evidence suggests Program P adaptations have potential to reduce women’s experiences of IPV from their male partners. Two programs rigorously evaluated with Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) (Bandebereho in Rwanda and Program P Bolivia) found statistically significant reductions in at least one form of IPV (physical, sexual, emotional, economic, or psychological).
• Violence Against Children (VAC) and Parenting: Three of the four programs that measured VAC prevalence found reductions in the use of physical punishment of children. The programs also showed promising evidence in increasing the use of positive parenting practices (e.g., explaining misbehavior, redirecting attention).
• Caregiving and Domestic Work: Six of the seven programs that measured men's participation reported positive changes, showing men increased their time spent on household and childcare tasks, though gendered roles often persisted.
• Couple Relations: Two RCTs found statistically significant evidence of increased joint decision-making and multiple programs reported improved couple communication and emotional support.
• MNCH/SRH: Programs successfully shifted men's attitudes toward and increased their participation in supporting MNCH, leading to increased women's attendance at antenatal care visits and greater use of modern contraception.
Core Components for Effective Implementation

"Many Ways of Being: An inclusive, youth-centered curriculum focused on gender equity, healthy relationships, and safer sex practices",https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Many_Ways_Of_Being_Curriculum_English_2hr_Sessions.pdf,"Summary of the Source
The Many Ways of Being (MWB) curriculum is an eight-session (16-hour) program designed for young people of all gender identities, ages 15 to 19. While adaptable, it was initially developed based on formative research with Black and Latinx youth and is primarily intended for implementation with youth of color in Washington, DC.
Core Goals and Approach
The program is grounded in gender-transformative approaches, meaning it aims to transform unequal gender roles, norms, and power relations to promote more equitable outcomes and constructive roles for people of all genders. The ultimate goals are to reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unplanned pregnancy, and to promote healthy, consensual, and violence-free relationships among youth.
The methodology is also described as medically accurate, trauma-informed, sex-positive, and culturally responsive. The curriculum's development was informed by Equimundo's earlier single-sex curricula, Manhood 2.0 and Sisterhood 2.0, which were U.S. adaptations of Program H and Program M. A key adaptation in MWB was combining genders in sessions to reflect the desire for gender-synchronous implementation and emphasize that there are indeed ""many ways of being"". The content consistently pushes beyond the gender binary and heteronormative relationships.
Key Curriculum Content (Sessions 1–8)
The curriculum is organized into sessions that focus on identity, emotion, relationships, sexual health, and future planning:
• Identity and Gender (Session 2): Participants explore the concepts of sex assigned at birth, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation, discussing the restrictive nature and consequences of rigid forms of masculinity and femininity (the ""Man Box"" and ""Woman Box""). The curriculum incorporates an intersectional lens, probing how race, ethnicity, and wealth impact lived experiences.
• Emotions and Conflict (Session 3): Sessions address the impact of gendered expectations on expressing emotions, teach healthy coping strategies for difficult emotions (like anger), and develop effective communication skills using ""I"" statements in conflict resolution.
• Power and Relationships (Session 4): Participants define healthy and unhealthy relationships and explore how unequal power dynamics can lead to various forms of violence. The session concludes with developing strategies for setting boundaries.
• Media and Sexuality (Session 5): The curriculum encourages critical evaluation of media, including social media and advertising, focusing on their influence on body image, gender roles, and unrealistic expectations. It includes a specific activity on sexually explicit media (pornography and sexting), emphasizing the difference between fantasy and reality, and the risks involved.
• Sexual Health and Safety (Sessions 6 & 7): These sessions cover establishing and maintaining sexual consent (as an ongoing process), reviewing information on STIs and safer sex practices, and providing a demonstration of the correct use of both external and internal condoms. Session 7 covers different contraceptive methods and equips youth with knowledge of their patient rights when seeking clinical services (confidentiality, access to services without parental consent in DC, and advocating for themselves).
• Future Planning (Session 8): The final session includes a review, the post-program evaluation, and an activity where participants develop a personal health plan to integrate lessons learned into their lives, anticipating challenges and identifying support systems.
Implementation Guidance
Facilitators are provided with bolstered guidance, including scripted language to ensure fidelity and help navigate sensitive topics. They are trained to use a participatory and interactive approach (e.g., role-play, discussion, game-based learning), and are reminded of their role as mandatory reporters for disclosures of abuse or harm.","• Many Ways of Being (MWB)

Generations for Change: Engaging Men and Boys in Addressing Violence against Women and Girls (Parents’ Curriculum),https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Parents-Curriculum_ENG_HQ.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is the Generations for Change – Parents Curriculum, a 13-session program jointly developed by Equimundo and Terre des hommes Lausanne (Tdh), with support from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. It has been specifically adapted to the Jordanian context.
Target Audience and Goals
The curriculum is designed for parents of early adolescents (ages 12 to 14). It engages both fathers and mothers to take a family approach centered on gender norms, healthy relationships, and positive parenting techniques. The core goal is to reduce intergenerational violence and foster caring and supportive relationships within the family.
Structure and Content
The curriculum is divided into thirteen sessions. A complementary curriculum exists for youth, and parents and youth participate together in two sessions toward the end. The format alternates between sessions held with men and women separately (e.g., Sessions 1–4, 7) and sessions where they engage together (starting with Session 5).
Key themes covered include:
• Gender and Norms (Session 2): Participants discuss the difference between sex and gender, reflect on how gender norms (expectations of men and women, explored through the ""Man Box, Woman Box, Human Box"" activity) influence lives and relationships, and explore roles in the home and society.
• Legacy and History (Session 3 & 5): Parents reflect on their own parents’ influence to reinforce positive aspects and avoid repeating harmful patterns. Session 5 brings couples together for the first time to explore their shared history and future.
• Emotions and Conflict (Session 4 & 8): Sessions help participants identify and express anger through means other than violence. Conflict resolution involves identifying sources of conflict and practicing effective communication skills, active listening, and nonviolent ways to react.
• Power and Violence (Session 6 & 7): Participants increase their awareness of power (including ""power over,"" ""power to,"" ""power with,"" and ""power within"") and the advantages of equitable decision-making within the home. Session 7 identifies different types of violence (physical, emotional/psychological, sexual, economic) and discusses the link between past violence and violence used against others (Cycle of Violence). The curriculum stresses that violence is a learned behavior that can be unlearned.
• Parenting Adolescents (Session 9 & 10): Sessions focus on learning about adolescent development (ages 12–14), building parental empathy, and showing love and affection. Positive parenting skills and techniques are taught to discourage harsh discipline (hitting, slapping, yelling), emphasizing that aggression is counterproductive to achieving long-term goals for children.
• Family Collaboration (Session 11, 12, 13): The final sessions, including those facilitated with children present, focus on effective family communication, developing a shared family vision, reflecting on positive changes made, and creating family action plans to sustain these changes.
Facilitation and Safety
Facilitators are positioned as guides, not teachers, promoting participatory learning and critical reflection. Due to the sensitive nature of the topics, facilitators must prioritize creating a safe space, use a trauma-sensitive approach, and be knowledgeable about referral services for mental health, violence, and child protection concerns. They must also be aware of and explain mandatory reporting requirements for disclosures of abuse involving minors. The methodology uses structured elements like Mindfulness Activities and a Weekly Commitment (homework) to help participants apply lessons daily.","• Generations for Change

Generations for Change: Engaging Men and Boys in Addressing Violence against Women and Girls (Youth Curriculum),https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Youth-Curriculum_ENG_HQ.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is the Generations for Change – Youth Curriculum, developed by Equimundo and Terre des hommes Lausanne (Tdh), with support from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Published in September 2022, it is part of an innovative program that centers a family approach to healthy relationships and gender norms.
Target Audience and Structure
The curriculum is intended to be facilitated separately with young adolescents, specifically boys and girls aged 12 to 14. Its primary goal is to reduce intergenerational violence and foster caring and supportive relationships within families. The program consists of 13 sessions, with the majority held in single-sex groups to allow participants to feel comfortable discussing sensitive issues. However, two sessions (Session 11, ""Communicating as a Family,"" and Session 12, ""My Family Working as a Team"") are designed to bring the youth together with their parents.
Core Thematic Content
The curriculum guides youth through critical reflections on socialization, power, and violence:
• Gender and Norms (Sessions 2 & 3): Sessions aim to build understanding on the difference between sex and gender and reflect on how rigid gender roles and expectations (e.g., ""Act Like a Man,"" ""Act Like a Woman"") impact the lives and well-being of both boys and girls.
• Power Dynamics (Session 4): Participants increase their awareness of power and its existence in relationships, including the four forms of power: power over, power to, power with, and power within. The goal is to reflect on how to use power in positive ways and avoid using others as ""things"".
• Violence and Empathy (Sessions 5 & 6): The curriculum identifies different types of violence (physical, emotional/psychological, sexual, and economic). Violence is defined as a learned behavior that can be eliminated. Sessions also focus on building empathy by having youth reflect on causing harm, experiencing violence, and ways to break the cycle of violence.
• Family, Emotions, and Future (Sessions 7–13): Youth reflect on the influence and legacy of their parents and authority figures to avoid repeating negative patterns. Session 8 focuses on identifying anger and emotions and teaching positive ways to express feelings without resorting to violence. Later sessions focus on developing effective communication skills with family, planning for the future, and constructing positive self-identities and life plans.
Facilitation and Safety Guidelines
Facilitators are explicitly defined as guides, not teachers, whose role is to promote critical reflection and participatory learning. The materials provide detailed guidance on creating a safe space, managing potentially difficult group dynamics (especially during mixed sessions), and using techniques like Mindfulness Activities and Weekly Commitments (""homework""). Due to the sensitive nature of the topics, facilitators must be knowledgeable about referral services for counseling and support and are reminded repeatedly of their obligations regarding mandatory reporting of abuse or sexual assault involving minors.","• Generations for Change

JOURNEYS OF TRANSFORMATION DIALOGUE CLUBS: A TRAINING MANUAL FOR ENGAGING MEN AS ALLIES IN WOMEN’S ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Manual_ING-1.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This manual outlines the Journeys of Transformation Dialogue Clubs, a 13-session training manual developed by Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice and Global Communities (formerly PCI). The program is financially assisted by the USDA through the EDUCAMOS project and is designed for implementation in Guatemala and across the region.
Target Audience and Goals
The program is designed to engage the husbands or partners of women participants already involved in Global Communities’ Women Empowered (WE) program. The WE program focuses on the economic, social, and political empowerment of women through self-managed savings groups.
The Dialogue Clubs program complements the existing WE curriculum by engaging men as more equitable and supportive partners in improving household well-being and women’s participation in economic activities. The sessions are highly interactive and dynamic, using participants' experiences to motivate the adoption of new, positive attitudes and behaviors, specifically focusing on strengthening communication skills to promote healthy, equitable, and nonviolent couple relationships.
Core objectives include:
• Promoting gender-equitable attitudes and support for women’s autonomy and leadership, particularly regarding decisions about their bodies, lives, and finances.
• Encouraging men to share the responsibility for childcare and domestic work.
• Strengthening effective couple communication and anger management skills to promote nonviolent relationships.
• Allowing men and women to recognize different forms of violence against women and children and discuss how violence is sustained by power imbalances and gender inequality.
• Increasing knowledge and balanced decision-making regarding sexual and reproductive health and family planning.
• Supporting couples in creating a household budget and discussing joint financial decision-making.
Structure and Themes
The manual is structured into 13 sessions (plus an introductory Session 0), organized around four core modules or themes:
1. Exploring Gender and Power (Sessions 2, 3): Includes reflecting on gender roles using the Man, Woman, and Human Boxes and challenging concepts of Patriarchy and Power.
2. Equality Inside and Outside the Home (Sessions 4–9): Focuses on changing roles, the intergenerational transmission of caregiving (""My Father’s Legacy""), couple communication and conflict resolution, sharing the care work, joint decision-making, family budgeting, and supporting women’s leadership.
3. Sexual and Reproductive Health and Family Planning (Session 10): Addresses the menstrual cycle, conception, contraceptive methods for men and women, and couples-based family planning discussions.
4. Working Together to Prevent Violence Against Women (Sessions 11–13): Focuses on recognizing the types of violence, understanding laws against violence, practicing anger management (""What Do I Do When I’m Angry?""), and creating a social support network.
Methodology and Implementation
The program uses a participatory methodology where sessions are generally two hours long. Sessions are designed for men and women together or separately, often separating them for sensitive topics (like gender, power, and violence) to ensure comfort and safety, while combining them for activities like couple communication and budgeting. A key element is the Weekly Commitment, a task participants must perform at home to integrate lessons into their daily lives.
The formative research conducted in Huehuetenango, Guatemala, revealed that both men and women desired a program to improve family relationships, strengthen communication, manage resources, and discuss sexual health. Recommendations for recruiting men include emphasizing how the group will help them achieve their household economic goals and highlighting personal and family benefits.
Facilitators are intended to be guides, not teachers, who create a safe, respectful, and nonjudgmental environment. Given the sensitive topics, the manual includes detailed guidance on establishing group agreements (including confidentiality) and a comprehensive referral protocol for victims of violence and mental health disclosures, emphasizing that facilitators are not counselors and must prioritize the safety and autonomy of survivors.","• Journeys of Transformation Dialogue Clubs

Manual Programa H Bolivia: Involucrando a hombres y mujeres jóvenes por la igualdad de género,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Programa-H-Bolivia-5-marzo-ALTA.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is the Manual Programa H Bolivia, a detailed curriculum coordinated by Promundo—US, ECAM, and Colectivo Rebeldía. It was generously funded by the Embajada de Suecia en La Paz. This adaptation of Programa H is designed to work with young men and women in Bolivia to promote gender equality.
Context and Program Rationale
The manual acknowledges that gender inequality is sustained by cultural factors (restrictive gender norms) and structural factors (patriarchal systems). It notes that in Bolivia, relationships of power between men and women in the domestic and public spheres are asymmetrical. Bolivia has the highest prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Latin America (53.3% of women aged 15-49), and the use of violent discipline against children is common (reported by 80% of mothers and 75% of fathers surveyed). The manual asserts that engaging young men and women early in life to reflect on gender socialization and power inequalities is fundamental to promoting gender equality and reducing the intergenerational transmission of violence.
Methodology and Structure
Programa H is a gender-transformative intervention that utilizes periodic group educational sessions alongside community mobilization and campaigns to promote critical reflection on the ""costs"" of traditional masculinity. The methodology is activo—participativa (active-participatory), drawing on popular education and feminist pedagogy to create a safe climate for participants to share experiences, generate debate, and promote conscientization and change in gender relations, specifically challenging machismo and patriarchy. Sessions are ideally about two hours long, held weekly, over a period that supports sustained attitude and behavior change.
The manual is organized into six thematic Axes (Ejes) and a methodological framework:
1. Gender and Identity (Eje I): Includes sessions on the difference between sex and gender, and the restrictive nature of the Traditional Masculinity Box and Traditional Femininity Box.
2. Power and Relationships (Eje II): Focuses on recognizing the existence of power in relationships, the experience of being treated as ""things"", and the collective proposal of despatriarcalización (de-patriarchalization) to dismantle rigid power structures.
3. Sexual and Reproductive Rights (Eje III): Discusses the erotic body, the importance of sexual consent, Sexual and Reproductive Rights (DSDR), and prevention and detection of Sexually Transmitted Infections (ITS) and VIH/SIDA.
4. Care (Eje IV): Examines the legacy of the father and challenges the cultural assignment of caregiving roles solely to women, promoting the idea that care is the responsibility of both men and women.
5. Violence (Eje V): Identifies various types of violence (physical, psychological, sexual, economic), contrasts healthy and unhealthy relationships, and motivates men to become allies in action against machista violence.
6. Thinking about my future (Eje VI): Focuses on building a support network and defining a Commitment to Change regarding restrictive roles and machista expressions.
Facilitation and Safety
The facilitator acts as a guide, helping to open conversations and reflections, and must be sensitive and receptive, avoiding judgment or culpabilization. Given the sensitive topics, the manual emphasizes the construction of ""Reglas de convivencia"" (Rules of coexistence) and provides extensive ethical guidelines on confidentiality and specific steps for responding to and referring participants who reveal having suffered violence or who are experiencing severe mental health issues (e.g., suicidal ideation). Facilitators are reminded that they are not psychological counselors or therapists.","• Programa H Bolivia

Promoting Men’s Engagement in Early Childhood Development: A Programming and Influencing Package,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GLO-Mens_engagement_ECD-IO-Final-Eng-May21.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is a comprehensive guidance package developed for programs aiming to increase male engagement in nurturing care, early childhood development (ECD), and maternal health and wellbeing. It is based significantly on modules developed by Plan International Canada and Promundo for the Strengthening Health Outcomes for Women and Children (SHOW) project.
Core Philosophy: Gender-Transformative Approach
The guidance emphasizes a gender-transformative approach. This approach aims to tackle the root causes of gender inequality and reshape unequal gender and power relations to achieve full realization of rights for all, particularly girls and women. Promoting men's engagement in ECD is considered a crucial entry point for challenging limiting and discriminatory gender norms and roles.
A truly gender-transformative approach seeks long-term, positive changes in gender norms, relations, and power dynamics, striving to mobilize men as allies with women in promoting gender equality. It encourages critical reflection on gender roles and supports women's empowerment by addressing the distribution of resources and duties. Interventions should commit to principles like ""do no harm,"" recognizing the potential risks of backlash or unintentionally reducing women's autonomy.
Why Men's Engagement Matters
The document presents strong evidence supporting men's positive involvement in care and development:
• For Children: Caring, non-violent male involvement is associated with positive outcomes, including better physical and mental health, higher educational achievement, better peer relationships, greater empathy, and lower rates of behavioral problems. This benefit exists regardless of whether the father resides with the child.
• For Female Partners: Engaging men during pregnancy and fatherhood addresses underlying gender inequalities that can hinder maternal health and wellbeing. It is linked to increased uptake of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (MNCH) services by women.
• For Men and Families: Involved men report greater life satisfaction, less stress, and are more likely to adopt health-promoting behaviors. Men's participation is linked to improved couple relationships, greater satisfaction, increased equality in decision-making, and lower rates of domestic violence.
Key Barriers to Engagement
Despite the benefits, men’s engagement in unpaid care work remains limited globally. Barriers exist at multiple levels (individual, social, material, institutional):
• Gender Norms: Men are typically expected to be the protector and provider, while caregiving and domestic chores are viewed as less valued ""women's tasks"". Men who defy these norms may face ridicule or shaming.
• Beliefs about Capability: There is a prevailing societal belief that men are inadequate or not biologically programmed to be good caregivers, despite research showing fatherhood produces hormonal changes that support bonding.
• Service Exclusion: Men are often passively or actively excluded from child and family services (like MNCH), as services are often not welcoming, supportive, or offered at times men can attend.
• Policy Gaps: Policy environments often lack support, such as sufficient paid, non-transferable paternity leave.
Program Framework and Strategies
The guidance uses a Socio-Ecological Model to analyze influencing factors and entry points for challenging harmful gender norms at individual, relational, community, and societal/structural levels.
Key intervention strategies outlined in the chapters include:
1. Direct Work with Men (Chapter 2): Using group education, home visits, and mentorship (like Promundo’s Program H) to foster critical reflection, dialogue, and skills-building. Groups can be men-only, women-only, or synchronized (couples' sessions).
2. Enabling Services (Chapters 3 & 4): Working with healthcare providers, Community Health Workers (CHWs), and early education staff to adapt services (e.g., offering alternative clinic hours, training staff on gender norms) so they welcome and support men's participation. This also includes efforts to increase male educators in ECCE.
3. Community and Leaders (Chapter 5): Engaging respected faith leaders and traditional leaders as key allies and ""norm trend-setters"" to model and endorse new positive behaviors, fostering community-wide change.
4. Policy Influencing (Chapter 6): Implementing advocacy to change laws, policies (like paternity leave or social protection), and service regulations to create an enabling environment for male engagement.
5. Social and Behaviour Change Communication (SBCC) (Chapter 7): Developing messaging (e.g., posters, media) that is positive, aspirational, and gender-transformative to influence individual attitudes and social norms, often drawing on MenCare Global Campaign best practices.","• Men’s Engagement / Male Engagement

"Bandebereho Facilitator’s Manual: Engaging men as fathers and partners in maternal and newborn health, caregiving, violence prevention, and healthier couple relations",https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Bandebereho-Facilitators-Manual-2021.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is the Facilitator's Manual for the Bandebereho couples’ intervention, designed for expectant couples and parents of young children ages 0 to 5 in Rwanda. The program was adapted for the Rwandan context by the Rwanda Men’s Resource Center (RWAMREC), in partnership with Promundo. The current version (2021) is specifically adapted for transition-to-scale and delivery by trained community health workers via the Rwandan health system.
Program Goals and Impact
Bandebereho uses fatherhood as an entry-point to promote men’s active, non-violent, and equitable involvement in their children’s lives and family relationships. It employs a gender-transformative approach, requiring participants to critically question and reflect on rigid gender norms and social expectations for men and women, and the impact these norms have on their roles as partners and parents.
A Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) demonstrated the program’s significant impact, including:
• Reductions in both intimate partner violence (IPV) and violence against children (VAC).
• Improved maternal and newborn health (MNCH) outcomes, such as greater antenatal care attendance by women (and accompaniment by men).
• Greater use of modern contraceptive methods.
Structure and Core Themes
The current manual includes 17 thematic sessions (up from an earlier 15-session version). Sessions are typically 2 to 3 hours long. Many sessions are designed for men and women together, promoting dialogue between partners, while some are facilitated for men only to discuss sensitive topics more comfortably. The methodology relies on participatory activities, group discussion, and homework assignments (or ""check-in"") to apply lessons in daily life.
Key themes covered include:
• Gender and Identity (Session 2): Discussing the difference between sex and gender and reflecting on how gender norms influence expectations of men and women.
• Health and Caregiving (Sessions 4–7): Informing couples about healthy pregnancy, preparing men to support their partners during birth, including pain alleviation techniques, and promoting skin-to-skin contact for bonding and ensuring newborn care needs.
• Parenting and Violence (Sessions 8, 10–12): Connecting long-term goals for children (ages 0-5) with positive parenting skills, reflecting on the intergenerational impact of parents, identifying different types of violence (physical, emotional, sexual, economic), and discussing how to break the cycle of violence.
• Couple and Family Relations (Sessions 13–16): Reflecting on power dynamics and the advantages of equitable decision-making, encouraging men's participation in sharing household responsibilities (care work/housework), learning non-violent conflict resolution and communication techniques, and addressing the consequences of alcohol and drug abuse.
• Future Planning (Sessions 9, 14, 17): Reflecting on the benefits of family planning/contraception, creating a shared family vision, discussing family finances/budgeting, and creating family action plans to sustain positive changes.
Facilitation
Facilitators (ideally a male and a female pair) act as guides who encourage self-reflection and participation, rather than teachers. They must create a safe space and be prepared to manage sensitive topics, promoting inclusion of all participants, including those with disabilities, and be knowledgeable about referral services for professional support or counseling","• Bandebereho Facilitator’s Manual

Recruitment and Retention of Male Participants in Gender-Transformative Programs.,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Recruitment-and-Retention-of-Male-Participants-in-Gender-Transformative-Programs.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This brief, authored by Promundo and Plan International Canada, summarizes programmatic lessons and best practices for effectively recruiting and retaining male participants in gender-transformative programs. It draws on experiences from various global settings, including the multi-country Strengthening Health Outcomes for Women and Children (SHOW) program, which was funded by Global Affairs Canada.
Program Rationale (Why Engage Men)
The brief emphasizes that engaging men is crucial for achieving gender equality and improving family well-being. Male engagement is defined as men taking an active role in protecting and promoting the health and well-being of their partners and children, premised on a vision of sustainable behavioral and relational change.
• Benefits: Involved fatherhood benefits children's physical and mental health. Men themselves experience improvements in physical, mental, and sexual health outcomes, along with reductions in risk-taking behaviors. Programs like the SHOW project's Fathers Clubs promote men's equitable and nonviolent involvement in Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (MNCH) and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR).
• Entry Points: Expectant and new fatherhood is highlighted as an especially effective, transformative entry point for engaging men. Many men desire stronger emotional relationships and want to learn nonviolent ways to resolve conflict and discipline children, making them potential powerful agents of intergenerational change.
Common Barriers to Recruitment and Retention
Despite the benefits, programs often face challenges rooted in norms and economic constraints.
• Restrictive Gender Norms: Prevailing concepts of ""good fatherhood"" often revolve only around the roles of ""protector"" and ""provider,"" without emphasizing the role of ""nurturer"". If men feel they already live up to societal expectations, they may not see a need to participate in programming that promotes more involved fatherhood.
• Economic Constraints: In many contexts, conflicting work schedules or the need to attend to daily income-generating activities (especially agriculture in rural areas) prevent regular attendance.
• Backlash: Participants may face criticism or ""backbiting"" from within their households or the broader community for challenging norms or attending the sessions, which can act as a deterrent.
Best Practices and Lessons Learned
The brief details effective strategies based on field experiences (e.g., in Rwanda's Bandebereho program, and various SHOW countries):
• Scheduling and Logistics: Programs must meet men where they are—metaphorically and literally—by ensuring accessible physical venues. Scheduling sessions for the evenings or weekends and avoiding high-demand seasons (like harvesting) is recommended to accommodate work schedules.
• Messaging and Approach: Recruitment must appeal to men’s aspirations as fathers and partners. Programs should use a strengths-based approach and frame gender equality as not just a women's issue but one that benefits men's relationships, health, and lives.
• Content Implementation: Difficult topics like power and gender inequality should be introduced gradually to prevent men from feeling defensive or stigmatized. It is essential to clarify that participants are not being targeted or punished for ""bad"" behaviors.
• Community Integration: Engaging influential community leaders and faith leaders can increase program acceptance and uptake. However, this requires careful management to ensure the program remains gender-transformative rather than becoming merely gender-accommodating. Concurrent Social and Behavior Change Communication (SBCC) campaigns can help create a broader enabling environment that supports men's engagement.
• Retention Strategies: Strategies include providing simple amenities (e.g., snacks), using non-monetary incentives like awards, incorporating engaging methods like homework/discussions and role-play, and planning ""family days"" to engage the entire household.","• Recruitment and Retention

ole of Facilitation in Gender-Transformative Programs That Engage Men and Boys.,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Role-of-Facilitation-in-Gender-Transformative-Programs-That-Engage-Men-and-Boys.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is a brief authored by Promundo and Plan International Canada that summarizes programmatic lessons and best practices regarding high-quality facilitation within gender-transformative programs that engage men and boys. The brief draws on experiences from diverse global settings, including the Strengthening Health Outcomes for Women and Children (SHOW) program implemented across countries such as Bangladesh, Ghana, Haiti, Nigeria, and Senegal, as well as programs in Tajikistan, Nepal, Rwanda, and the United States.
The Importance of Facilitation and Critical Consciousness
Skilled facilitators are considered essential to the success of gender-transformative programs, as high-quality facilitation is vital for achieving program objectives and initiating transformative change. Effective group interventions aim to foster critical consciousness—an understanding of how social conditions privilege some but not others—by encouraging reflection on personal experiences, building group solidarity, and committing to making changes. Programs achieve this by starting a process of critical reflection and building solidarity among group members to mobilize change. For example, Promundo’s approach often includes exercises where men listen to women’s experiences regarding the unequal caregiving load or workplace discrimination, which can ignite critical consciousness when guided by a skilled facilitator.
Key Differences: Facilitator vs. Teacher
The brief emphasizes that facilitators must differ fundamentally from traditional teachers.
• A teacher is typically an expert who is expected to have all the answers.
• A facilitator is a guide who need not have all the answers but instead creates an open and safe space to facilitate dialogue and critical reflection among participants. They achieve this by asking unbiased, open-ended questions to elicit reflective responses.
Best Practices for Facilitation Success
The brief outlines best practices across four key areas:
1. Selection of Facilitators: Facilitators should possess strong interpersonal skills (e.g., authenticity, emotional maturity, active listening, ability to guide discussions). Recruitment should cast a wide net, and screening may include role-plays to check for necessary ""soft skills"". Identifying candidates from feminist and progressive social justice organizations is a good starting point as they often already embody the participatory values of gender-transformative programs. Facilitators should ideally be familiar with and able to relate to the participants' lived realities to build trust. Demographics like age and marital status may need consideration due to cultural norms affecting group dynamics.
2. Training: Training must provide sufficient time and intensity; training periods ranging from ten days up to 25 days (including booster sessions) are suggested, depending on prior experience. Trainings should cover content like gender as a social construct, power, and violence against women, and allow adequate time to practice facilitation skills, learn to respond to disclosures of violence and trauma, and build group cohesion. Discussing the theoretical basis for choosing a participatory approach (e.g., Freire’s ""banking"" versus ""liberating"" models) can help prevent facilitators from reverting to authoritarian or lecture-style methods. Involving facilitators in curriculum design can build buy-in and ensure the curriculum is low-literacy friendly, if needed.
3. Facilitation Strategies: Facilitators should model gender-equitable relationships (e.g., co-facilitators sharing note-taking and leading sessions equally). They must minimize power differentials with participants, even through small gestures like sitting on the same level. Strategies include probing the group’s views rather than imposing views or giving ""right"" answers, and ensuring the discussion is not dominated by ""gatekeepers"". Sensitive topics, like violence, need adequate time and should be introduced in a generalized way, ensuring participants are never forced to share uncomfortable experiences. While empathy is a powerful tool, facilitators must be careful not to reinforce harmful gender stereotypes (e.g., valorizing women as inherently more emotional).
4. Support and Monitoring: A clear supervisory process must be established from the program's design phase. Monitoring should track implementation quality and fidelity. Supportive supervision and regular check-ins are crucial, potentially using technology like voice-recognition software for reports or social media groups (e.g., WhatsApp) for real-time troubleshooting. Programs must actively monitor against the perpetuation of harmful ideas (e.g., that violence is ""provoked""). Programs should also create spaces for facilitators to reflect and recuperate (e.g., reflection diaries) to maintain motivation, as the work is intensive and demanding. Importantly, facilitators often experience deep personal change, becoming aware of unequal relationships and desiring to be more gender-equitable in their own lives.","• Facilitation / Facilitators

"Engaging Religious Leaders in Reducing Maternal and Child Mortality, and Gender Equality: Field Experiences from the SHOW Project in Sokoto State, Nigeria",https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SHOW-religious-leaders_July22.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This knowledge brief documents the programmatic benefits, challenges, and outcomes of intensely engaging Islamic religious leaders in Sokoto State, Nigeria, as part of the 4.5-year Strengthening Health Outcomes for Women and Children (SHOW) project. Sokoto State is a conservative region where 95% of the population is Muslim, and religious leaders are seen as key role models and gatekeepers of social values and behaviors.
Program Rationale and Approach
The SHOW project aimed to reduce maternal and child mortality by taking a gender-transformative approach. This involved empowering women and girls, engaging men to address rigid gender-related barriers, and improving the quality and use of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (MNCH) and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) services. Engaging religious leaders was seen as crucial to creating an enabling environment for successful male engagement and promoting gender-equitable relationships.
Key Activities and Methodology
The program engaged religious leaders through several sequential activities:
1. Sensitization Meetings: Highly interactive meetings where health officials presented data on maternal and child mortality, and religious leaders discussed harmful practices, decision-making in the family, and the importance of supporting pregnant and breastfeeding mothers.
2. Training of Trainers (ToT): Promundo conducted a ToT on the Fathers Clubs manual (adapted from Program P), a curriculum designed to engage fathers in gender equality, MNCH, and SRHR.
3. Co-creation of the Manual: The most innovative strategy was the co-creation and validation of the “Islamic Perspectives on MNCH Issues” manual. This document, led by Sheikh (Dr.) Mustapha Sidi Attahiru, provides evidence from the Quran and Hadith showing that messages on gender equality, supporting wives, and practices like child spacing are compatible with or even required by Islam. This process built strong ownership among the religious community.
Findings and Impact
The research, which relied on interviews with religious leaders and Plan staff (but lacked interviews with community members), documented several successes:
• Gender and Health Messaging: Religious leaders used the manual as a reference to consistently share gender-equitable MNCH/SRH messages during weekly Friday sermons in the mosque, as well as on radio and TV shows and at ceremonies (like Ramadan and weddings). Linking these messages directly to the Quran helped prevent community backlash because religious texts are viewed as absolute truth.
• Attitude Change: The intensive engagement and collaboration process led to considerable shifts in the personal attitudes and practices of the religious leaders themselves. Male leaders started acting as role models by helping their wives with household chores (cooking, sweeping) and escorting them to the clinic.
• Community and Household Changes (Reported by Leaders): Religious leaders reported positive community changes, including men sharing decision-making power in the household, increased women's participation in community work committees and small businesses, and men routinely participating in household chores even when their wives were not sick. Mosques reportedly became safe spaces for men to discuss sensitive MNCH issues.
Challenges and Lessons Learned
Challenges included achieving consensus on the interpretation of the Quran during the manual’s creation, especially regarding child spacing. Other challenges were logistical, such as the fact that female religious leaders could not use the mosque for consistent preaching, and the difficulty of reaching older audiences. A key lesson learned was that replacing the phrase ""family planning"" with ""child spacing"" (and linking it to the Hadith) made the topic more acceptable to followers.","• Religious Leaders / Islamic Leaders / Sheikh / Chief Imam

Breaking the Cycle of Intergenerational Violence: The Promise of Psychosocial Interventions to Address Children’s Exposure to Violence.,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Breaking-The-Cycle-Equimundo.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This brief, jointly authored by Equimundo and Sonke Gender Justice, examines the potential of psychosocial interventions to act as a secondary prevention approach against the intergenerational transmission of violence.
Core Rationale: The Intergenerational Cycle
The document highlights a clear and consistent link between childhood exposure to violence (witnessing or experiencing) and an increased risk for both men’s future perpetration and women’s future experience of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in adulthood. This cycle is driven by complex mechanisms:
1. Gender norms and social learning: Boys may learn that violence is a normative way to resolve conflict and perform harmful masculinity, sometimes leading to hostility toward women or a desire to control them.
2. Psychological mechanisms: Exposure to violence often results in significant mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), emotion regulation difficulties, and toxic stress impacting the developing brain. Poor psychological functioning increases the risk of perpetrating or experiencing IPV.
Interventions and Evidence
The brief focuses on psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents (ages three to 18). These interventions are critical not only to improve immediate well-being but also to prevent future IPV. The programs are organized by their level of delivery: Individual/Group, Family, School, or Community.
The intervention with the most evidence is Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), a components-based model summarized by the PRACTICE acronym. TF-CBT has demonstrated efficacy in the Global South, including in Zambia, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
Other evidence-based or promising approaches include:
• Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT): A time-limited intervention focusing on resolving social struggles like conflict, grief, and social isolation, which has shown strong benefits for depressed adolescents (IPT-A).
• Transdiagnostic approaches: Programs like the Common Elements Treatment Approach (used in Zambia) and POD/POD Adventures (in India) address multiple co-occurring mental health conditions (PTSD, anxiety, depression) simultaneously, which is highly relevant for violence survivors.
• School Interventions: These include targeted programs like Youth Living Peace (in Brazil and DRC, adapted from Equimundo’s Program H and the Living Peace Institute) and Expect Respect (US-based), which focus on changing attitudes, nonviolent communication, and healing from violence.
Key Findings and Recommendations
• Dual Approach: The document strongly recommends that violence prevention efforts integrate psychosocial approaches with gender-transformative interventions to address both the psychological trauma and the learned harmful gender attitudes that perpetuate the cycle of violence.
• Scaling Up: Scaling up is necessary but challenging due to a severe lack of trained mental health professionals. The brief notes the feasibility of using lay facilitators and delivering group interventions in low-resource and culturally diverse settings.
• Safety and Stigma: Programs must prioritize participant safety, including developing clear guidelines for involving caregivers who may be perpetrators. They must also work actively to avoid survivor blame and reduce the stigma associated with mental health conditions.
• Research Gaps: To date, no child-focused psychosocial program has collected long-term follow-up data specifically evaluating the reduction of future IPV perpetration or experiences, a critical area for future research."," Breaking the Cycle of Intergenerational Violence

Healthy Masculinity Tip Sheet for Parents,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/healthy-masculinity-tipsheet-for-parents.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is a practical guide (a tipsheet) providing 9 concrete tips for parents on how to raise caring, respectful boys and promote healthy masculinity. It draws on decades of U.S. and global research from Plan and Promundo. The guidance is issued in response to unprecedented, open discussions about gender equality, power, harassment, and cultural norms. The core premise is that while women and girls are encouraged to challenge traditional stereotypes, the messages given to boys and men often remain rigid, necessitating intentional intervention by parents.
Key Guidance and Evidence-Based Tips:
The tipsheet emphasizes several key areas for challenging harmful gender norms:
1. Encouraging Expression and Identity: Parents should introduce boys to a range of toys, games, and activities, including those traditionally seen as ""for girls,"" as well as gender-neutral toys. Research suggests that children who play with more gender-neutral toys tend to grow up more interested in creating a more equal world. Parents should also allow boys to experiment with fashion and self-expression (e.g., clothing, long hair, nail polish) that doesn't fit typically advertised stereotypes, recognizing that 72 percent of young men in the U.S. have been told that ""a real man"" behaves a certain way.
2. Fostering Emotions and Empathy: Parents should use play and imagination to define positive values like being compassionate, caring, and collaborative. They should highlight that expressing a full range of emotions is positive for both boys and girls. Promundo's research shows that 86 percent of young men (18-24) exhibit high rates of empathy, and parents must actively encourage this, staying away from language that discourages healthy emotions, such as ""boys don’t cry"".
3. Teaching Consent: Parents must be clear that boys must ask for permission to touch others and that they also have the right to say ""no"" if they do not want to be touched. Challenging rigid norms around manhood and ensuring boys understand consent is vital, as young men who believe in rigid ideas about manhood are more likely to harass. A costing study found that eliminating harmful masculine norms could reduce sexual violence among men (18-30) in the U.S. by at least 69 percent annually.
4. Modeling and Environment: Parents should ""Walk the walk"" by challenging their own gender roles and modeling equitable behavior, particularly by sharing care work more equally with the child's other parent. Promundo’s global research finds that if children, especially boys, see their fathers doing their full share of care work, they are more likely to do the same as adults.
5. Countering Negative Narratives: Parents must speak up immediately if family members or friends make problematic or disrespectful comments about women. This is necessary because Plan's survey found that almost half of adolescent boys hear their fathers or male family members make inappropriate jokes and comments about women.
6. Open Communication: Parents must ""Talk the talk"" by making sure boys feel supported and unjudged when they share their concerns or questions. The research notes that when young men do ask for help, 25 percent go to their mothers, compared to only 7 percent who go to their fathers.
The document concludes that countering stereotypes requires a concerted effort from individual families, schools, corporate boardrooms, government institutions, and media.","• Healthy Masculinity

UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS CASE FOR GENDER EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/F-Understanding-the-Business-Case-for-Gender-Equality-in-the-Workplace.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is a policy and guidance brief developed by UN Women and Promundo-US, leveraging data and recommendations from the multi-country International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES MENA). The brief aims to demonstrate the rationale for prioritizing gender equality in the workplace, particularly within the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
The Business Case Rationale
The brief argues that advancing gender equality is not only a basic human right and a precondition for sustainable development, but also provides significant positive economic effects.
• Economic Growth: Reducing the gender gap in workforce participation could lead to significant boosts in the region's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
• Profitability and Talent: Providing equal opportunities helps capitalize on an untapped talent pool (given high investments in women’s education) and can boost a company's profitability through increased retention and reduced turnover. Women's leadership can also improve decision-making and reduce high-risk financial transactions.
• Benefits for Men: Policies supporting women also improve the workplace for men. Offering policies like equal, well-paid, non-transferable parental leave can increase men's life satisfaction, happiness, and connection at home, validating identities beyond just being financial providers.
Context of Inequality in MENA
Despite recent progress, women's workforce participation in MENA remains among the lowest in the world, with only 27% of working-age women participating in the labor force compared to 77% of men. Key barriers include:
• Legal Restrictions: Laws that prohibit women from working at night or in certain jobs deemed ""harmful"".
• Gender Stereotypes: Prevailing stereotypes emphasizing men as financial providers and women as homemakers are major barriers to equality. This often leads employers to assume marriage or family responsibilities will limit women’s productivity.
• Structural Barriers: Lack of access to safe and reliable transportation and the high rates of sexual harassment in public spaces and workplaces deter women from entering and staying in the workforce.
Concrete Guidance and Strategies
The brief provides action-oriented guidance for business leaders, emphasizing that changes must be gender-transformative. Key strategies include:
• Hiring: Implementing gender-neutral processes, eliminating discriminatory questions (e.g., about marital status or family plans), using objective rubrics, and considering quotas or affirmative action measures.
• Family-Friendly Policies: Offering equal, well-paid, non-transferable parental leave for all caregivers to alleviate the burden of care on women and promote continued employment. This should be complemented by high-quality affordable childcare options.
• Safety and Harassment: Explicitly prohibiting sexual harassment in the workplace, providing gender-transformative training for staff, and establishing clear grievance and referral mechanisms for survivors.
• Training and Culture: Instituting mandatory gender-transformative diversity trainings to challenge power dynamics and stereotypes. Leadership must actively model gender equality and involve employees at all levels in developing policies.
Case Studies
The guidance is supported by case studies of two businesses:
• Mansour Group (Egypt): This conglomerate removed the requirement for applicants to state their gender, ensures equal pay, and trains employees as gender-equality advocates. They noted that changing deeply embedded cultural mindsets remains the biggest challenge.
• Bank of Palestine: The Bank committed to reaching 50% female employees by 2020, introduced the Felestiniya Programme for women’s economic empowerment, offers paternity leave, and ensures equal pay. They faced internal resistance from male employees who felt threatened by policies favoring women’s advancement.","• Gender Equality

ENGAGING MEN IN GENDER-TRANSFORMATIVE APPROACHES TO END VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FUnderstanding-How-to-Engage-Men-in-GenderTransformative-Approaches-to-End-Violence-Against-Women-1.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is a Guidance Note developed by UN Women and Promundo-US that leverages data and recommendations from the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) – Middle East and North Africa (MENA). It provides guidance for civil society partners and United Nations key players in the MENA region on designing and adapting programming and policy environments that promote non-violence in homes, workplaces, and public spaces, with the ultimate goal of achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Specifically, the note focuses on achieving SDG Goal 5 to eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in both the public and private spheres.
Context of Violence in MENA
The brief highlights that violence against women (VAW) is widespread in the MENA region, occurring at home and in public spaces in physical, sexual, emotional, and economic forms.
• Intimate Partner Violence (IPV): IMAGES MENA data found that approximately 10% to 45% of ever-married men reported using physical violence against a female partner, with similar numbers of women affirming the experience. Emotional violence is even more prevalent, with 20% to 80% of men reporting perpetration against their wives. Tolerance for IPV is widespread; for example, 90% of men and 70% of women in Egypt believe wives should tolerate violence to keep the family together.
• Sexual Harassment: Between 31% and 65% of men report having perpetrated street-based sexual harassment, while 40% to 63% of women report experiencing it. Up to 90% of men who harass say they do it for fun, and two thirds to three quarters blame women for dressing ""provocatively,"" a view shared by similar percentages of women in several countries.
• Root Causes: Key root causes of VAW include women’s limited power and mobility, widely held attitudes that justify violence, and exposure to violence in childhood. Men who witnessed their fathers use violence against their mothers or experienced violence themselves as children were significantly more likely to perpetrate IPV as adults.
Programmatic Guidance
To fundamentally address VAW, programs must adopt a multilevel framework that considers factors at the individual, relationship, community, and societal levels. Key recommendations include:
1. Comprehensive Approach: Avoid one-off campaigns. Instead, develop mutually reinforcing components across individual, institutional, and community levels (e.g., group education combined with referral services and public campaigns).
2. Gender-Transformative Approach: Go beyond simply recognizing inequality to directly challenge and change harmful norms that perpetuate violence and justify its use. Failure to address these underlying ideas, such as restrictive masculinity associated with income earning, can lead to negative unintended consequences, like increased IPV against women gaining economic status.
3. Accountability and Solidarity: Programmes engaging men must keep women’s rights and safety at the center and maintain solidarity and accountability to the women’s movement. Men's engagement must not result in side-lining women’s voices, opinions, or leadership. Tools like the MenEngage Accountability Toolkit can help align men's work with women-led efforts.
4. Aspirational Messaging: Use an empowering, aspirational approach that focuses on the potential for thriving, non-violent families and communities. Messaging should feature the voices of men who reject all forms of violence against women.
5. Community Focus: Programs should engage whole communities using messages about community well-being to avoid counterproductive notions of ""men versus women"".
Policy and Advocacy Guidance
Legal protections are necessary but insufficient for eliminating VAW. Advocacy efforts should focus on creating an enabling environment through gender-transformative policies that challenge unequal power dynamics and root causes of violence. Specific policy recommendations include:
• Legislation: Enacting and enforcing specific domestic violence legislation that addresses unique intra-family elements and includes training for law enforcement and specialized courts. Legislation should also criminalize sexual harassment in the workplace, schools, and public spaces, and criminalize marital rape.
• Complementary Campaigns: Legislative reforms must be complemented by public awareness campaigns (like UN Women's ""HeForShe"" or ""Because I Am a Man"") to explain the necessity of the changes and help men understand the benefits of transforming underlying gendered expectations.
• FGM/C: Campaigns addressing Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) must engage men and boys, who are frequently the decision-makers regarding the practice.
• Accountability of Leaders: Identify, support, and hold accountable key male political, civil society, and religious leaders as visible allies who model gender equality and set a zero-tolerance standard for violence.
• Services for Survivors: Policies must be complemented by provision of services for survivors of violence, including medical care, mental health care, legal aid, and economic support.
• Law Enforcement Training: Conduct gender-transformative awareness trainings for the largely male law enforcement personnel (police, judges, lawyers) to encourage active implementation of laws and support for bringing more women into these professions.","• Engaging Men and Boys

Very Young Adolescence 2.0: A curriculum to promote gender equality and sexual and reproductive health,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PM-Adolescence-curriculum-v5-3-Final.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is the Very Young Adolescence 2.0 Curriculum, a 12-session manual adapted and written by Jane Kato-Wallace and Ruti Levtov from Promundo-US. It was developed with input from the College of Medicine Malawi and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and is specifically designed for Standard 6 students (ages 11 to 14) in Malawi, although it is adaptable to almost any setting.
Core Philosophy and Context
The curriculum targets very young adolescents because this age range is recognized as a critical time of transition when young people begin to achieve puberty, turn to peer groups, and experiment with social risk-taking behavior. Research shows that societal pressures based on rigid gender norms begin much earlier than commonly thought (by age five). For boys, these norms often emphasize being tough, emotionally stoic, and aggressive, which predicts poor physical/mental health and limited emotional involvement later in life. For girls, norms often encourage passivity, sexual objectification, and a disproportionate share of domestic and care work, hindering their participation in leadership. This curriculum seeks to intervene during this period of opportunity to support youth to define what manhood and womanhood mean to them.
The manual incorporates findings from the Global Early Adolescent Study conducted in Blantyre, Malawi. The context in Malawi includes challenges such as common teenage pregnancy (12.2% of 16-year-olds have begun childbearing) and high HIV prevalence in urban areas. The local findings informed the curriculum themes, highlighting issues like the wide accessibility of pornography, limited resources for menstrual hygiene, and parental discomfort discussing sexuality.
Theory of Change and Methodology
The curriculum's Theory of Change is based on Promundo's methodologies (Program H and Program M). The process involves four steps:
1. Learn: Through activity-based questioning and critical reflection about gender norms.
2. Rehearse: Practice equitable and nonviolent attitudes and behaviors in a comfortable group education setting.
3. Internalize: Adopt new gender attitudes and norms.
4. Live: Exhibit gender-equitable, non-violent, and healthy attitudes and behavior in everyday life, contributing to positive outcomes like reduced STIs, HIV/AIDS, and gender-based violence.
The manual also incorporates a strong focus on Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), including core competencies such as self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making.
The curriculum is delivered through 12 sessions, primarily in mixed-sex groups (though some sessions are single-sex) as an after-school program, utilizing interactive activities, role-plays, and collaborative projects.
Curriculum Sections and Goals
The overall goals for participants are to:
• Recognize and question unequal relations of power and privilege.
• Challenge harmful gender norms to promote girls’ agency and empowerment and boys’ care and connection.
• Appreciate sexual and reproductive changes in age-appropriate and ""body positive"" ways.
• Recognize violence and develop skills to challenge and prevent it.
The curriculum is divided into four sections:
• Section 1: Understanding and Challenging Harmful Gender Roles and Stereotypes: Focuses on welcoming participants, establishing a Group Agreement, and engaging in debates and discussions on gender roles and stereotypes (e.g., Session 1: Gender Debate; Session 2: Who Am I? Who Are You?; Session 3: All at the Same Time, discussing sharing childcare and domestic responsibilities).
• Section 2: From Violence to Peaceful Coexistence: Addresses power dynamics (Session 4: Persons and Things role-play), defining and identifying types of violence (Physical, Emotional, Sexual, Economic), and managing anger nonviolently (Session 6: Understanding My Emotions).
• Section 3: Appreciating My Body: Focuses on puberty and body changes (Sessions 7–9), including Mindful Breathing, discussing the Female Body/Male Body (Session 8), and learning about topics like wet dreams and menstruation. Sessions also address new emotions and attractions and the consequences of adolescent pregnancy (Sessions 10, 11).
• Section 4: Putting It All Together – I Want to Do That! Culminates in developing Student Activism Projects and celebrating commitments to promote gender equality and sexual and reproductive health (Session 12: Making My World a Better Place).
Role of the Facilitator
The facilitator is defined as a guide, not a teacher or expert, whose role is to create a safe, confidential, and respectful environment for discussion and reflection. Facilitators must be sensitive to complex and sensitive topics, promote inclusion, manage conflicts, and be knowledgeable about referral services for participants who need extra support.

Manhood 2.0: A Curriculum Promoting a Gender-Equitable Future of Manhood,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PM-Manhood-2-0-curriculum-v12-2-E.pdf,"Summary of the Source
Manhood 2.0 is a comprehensive, gender-transformative curriculum designed to engage young men aged 15 to 24 in the United States in promoting gender equity and healthier, nonviolent relationships.
Core Philosophy and Origin
The curriculum is based on the foundational and evidence-based methodologies Program H and Program M, which Promundo and its partners first developed in Latin America over 15 years ago and have since been used in over 35 countries. The approach is rooted in popular education, feminist collective action (particularly intersectional feminism), and the work of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, emphasizing collective consciousness-raising (or ""conscientization"") among those marginalized by racism, sexism, homophobia, and other oppressions.
The central premise is that harmful, rigid ideas about manhood—what the curriculum refers to as the ""Man Box""—are major drivers of negative health consequences, mental health concerns, relationship and sexual violence, bullying, and substance use. The program aims to move beyond gender-sensitive approaches (which only acknowledge inequality) to actively target and transform harmful stereotypes and norms.
Theory of Change (Learn-Rehearse-Internalize-Live)
The curriculum's process is designed to achieve sustained change through four key steps, complemented by supporting structures:
1. Learn: Young men engage in questioning and critical reflection about restrictive gender norms.
2. Rehearse: They practice new equitable and nonviolent attitudes and skills in the safe group education environment.
3. Internalize: They adopt new gender attitudes and norms.
4. Live: They apply gender-equitable, nonviolent behaviors in daily life, leading to positive outcomes like increased condom use and reduced relationship violence.
Manhood 2.0 uses a Socio-Ecological Model, recognizing that substantive change requires interventions at multiple levels, moving from individual reflection to relational, community, and societal change (e.g., through youth-led campaigns, activism, and advocacy).
Curriculum Structure and Content
The program's group education activities are typically structured in seven thematic sessions, ideally carried out over 10 to 16 weeks:
• Welcome: Introductions and establishing Group Agreements.
• Exploring Gender and Identity (Session 2): Defining sex, gender, and sexual orientation; examining individual attitudes (Values Clarification); and critically analyzing the restrictive ""Man Box"".
• Exploring Power and Relationships (Session 3): Understanding how power and oppression manifest (Persons and Things role-play), the impact of race, ethnicity, and patriarchy on power and privilege (Power Walk), and coping with feelings of disempowerment.
• Thinking about Our Emotions (Session 4): Discussing how gender norms restrict emotional expression; identifying and expressing anger constructively; and practicing a model for nonviolent conflict resolution (The Four Phrases).
• Sexual and Reproductive Health (Session 5): Discussing sexual desire (The Erotic Body), learning male and female reproductive anatomy, understanding contraception (including male responsibility and dual protection), correct condom use demonstration, and condom negotiation.
• Violence and Relationships (Session 6): Defining sexual consent (as enthusiastic and ongoing) and sexual coercion; naming healthy/unhealthy relationship characteristics; and practicing Bystander Intervention and building empathy (Empathy Clothesline) to interrupt the cycle of violence.
• Making a Commitment to Healthy Lives (Session 7): Practicing assertive communication (especially around contraception), reflecting on their Support Network, creating a positive self-identity and life plan, and exploring how to act as agents of change (Circles of Influence).
Implementation and Facilitation
Facilitators are positioned as guides, not teachers, who create a horizontal, open, and safe space for dialogue and critical reflection, modeling equitable behavior (ideally through male and female co-facilitation). Facilitators must be trained (recommended: 5–10 days), skilled in managing sensitive topics, and fully knowledgeable about local laws, minors’ rights, confidentiality, and mandatory reporting requirements for abuse. Formative research is highly recommended to adapt the curriculum to the specific needs and context of the target population.","• Manhood 2.0 Curriculum

 Engaging Men and Boys in Gender Equality and Health: A Global Toolkit for Action.,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Engaging-Men-and-Boys-in-Gender-Equality-and-Health-A-Global-Toolkit-for-Action-English.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document provides programmatic tools and guidance for implementing and assessing male engagement programming, particularly focusing on HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care, and support. The tools, such as questionnaires for health services professionals, are adaptable for needs assessments related to other health themes.
The Gender Continuum and Program Design
A core component of the guidance is the concept of a Gender Continuum, which is used to assess how a project addresses gender and why male involvement is critical to successful outcomes. The manual emphasizes that understanding how gender can affect project outcomes is a crucial aspect of successful programming.
The continuum categorizes projects into four groups:
1. Exploitative: Projects that exploit existing gender inequalities and stereotypes to achieve health or demographic goals. For example, a social marketing campaign that capitalizes on and reinforces machismo/male conquest, even if its goal is to increase condom sales.
2. Neutral (blind): Projects that do not attempt to address gender roles or norms.
3. Sensitive (accommodating): Projects that adjust to existing gender differences (e.g., providing separate services) to pursue health outcomes.
4. Transformative: Projects that seek to transform unequal gender relations to promote equity as a means to achieve health outcomes. For example, a Brazilian social marketing campaign that promotes a gender-equitable lifestyle among young men, emphasizing care and respect.
The document encourages implementers to always work toward developing gender-transformative projects.
Programmatic Lessons and Context
The source highlights various challenges and strategies based on real-world projects:
• Unintended Consequences: A family planning campaign in Zimbabwe promoting men's participation in family planning decision-making resulted in the unintended consequence of some men concluding that they should make decisions alone, highlighting the risk of misinterpretation.
• Service Adaptation: In South Africa, acknowledging that men often dictate the terms of heterosexual encounters, a pilot program attempted the innovative approach of promoting the female condom directly to men via male peer promoters.
• Addressing Barriers: Research in Malawi identified that the absence of discussion about pregnancy between husbands and wives was a major obstacle to maternal health care-seeking behaviors. Similarly, a project in Zambia tailored caregiving tasks for young women and young men involved in supporting people living with HIV.
• Alternative Delivery: In the Dominican Republic, a project used volunteer peer educators to hold after-school discussions in mixed-sex groups on dating, relationships, and contraception (including condoms), circumventing the public school system's inability to incorporate a reproductive health curriculum.
Core Gender and Sexuality Concepts
The guidance provides definitions for fundamental concepts essential for gender-transformative work:
• Sex refers to physiological attributes.
• Gender refers to the widely shared ideas and expectations in society concerning masculine and feminine roles, characteristics, and abilities.
• Gender Equality means that men and women enjoy the same status and opportunities across all spheres of society (economic, political, social, cultural).
• Sexuality encompasses how bodies give and receive pleasure, how individuals feel about their bodies (Body Image), and how they express romantic feelings.
• The negative aspect of sexuality is Sexuality to Control Others, which is used to violate rights or get something from another person, exemplified by sexual violence.
• Gender-Equitable actions that promote healthier lives include joint decision-making about health issues, respecting a woman's right to refuse sex, settling differences without violence, and sharing responsibility for parenting and care.","Male Engagement / Men and Boys

BEYOND GENDER STEREOTYPES: TEACHER GUIDANCE.,https://www.boyhoodinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Beyond-Gender-Stereotypes-Teacher-Guidance.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is a comprehensive Teacher Guidance manual for the Beyond Gender Stereotypes resource, developed to help UK primary schools teach pupils about restrictive or limiting gender stereotypes and encourage them to behave in gender inclusive and equitable ways. This resource is part of The Children's Society's Lifting Limits programme and the Global Boyhood Initiative, coordinated by Equimundo and funded in the UK by Cummins Inc..
Program Goals and Rationale
The core goal is for pupils to develop the essential knowledge, skills, and attributes to recognize and challenge gender stereotypes, develop healthy relationships and ways of expressing emotions, and thrive in the world. Teaching about gender stereotypes is critical because stereotyping perpetuates gender inequality, limits children's potential, and undermines healthy emotional expression. Challenging these stereotypes benefits both boys and girls, helping them lead happier and healthier lives; for boys, breaking free from stereotypes leads to greater investment in their own social, emotional, and mental health.
The curriculum supports the school's statutory duty to teach Relationships Education (including respectful relationships and caring friendships) and provides opportunities to teach safeguarding, including concepts like stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, and equality. The lessons are designed to be taught through PSHE education.
Curriculum Structure (Key Stage 2)
The resource provides two short units of learning for Key Stage 2:
• Year 3/4 (Lower Key Stage 2): Consists of three lessons, focusing on recognizing stereotypes, explaining how to challenge them, and identifying the qualities of friendship.
• Year 5/6 (Upper Key Stage 2): Consists of four lessons, focusing on how stereotypes are reinforced (including online targeting), how they influence aspirations and careers, and how stereotyping can lead to prejudice and discrimination.
Key concepts explored across the units include:
• Gender: Defined as the behavior, attributes, and roles society thinks are appropriate for people based on perceived biological sex.
• Violence and Discrimination: Lessons address how gender stereotyping can lead to discrimination and prejudice, and how to identify ways to address it.
• Emotions and Health: Lessons encourage boys and girls to recognize when stereotypes stop them from sharing their feelings honestly and provide strategies for expressing emotions in healthier ways.
• Intersectionality: While the term itself is not taught to primary pupils, the resource recognizes that factors like ethnicity, disability, and social class intersect with gender to influence a person’s experience of discrimination.
Effective Teaching and Safeguarding Principles
The guidance outlines several essential principles for safe and effective delivery:
• Facilitation: Lessons should be taught by the class teacher, who acts as a trained professional and facilitator to guide discussions, rather than being an ""expert"". Teachers should have received training on effective PSHE delivery and challenging gender stereotypes.
• Positive Learning Environment: Creating a safe and inclusive space is paramount, starting with establishing and enforcing Ground Rules that cover respect, confidentiality, and the right to pass.
• Distancing Strategies: The curriculum uses fictional case studies and scenarios to allow pupils to reflect on issues without feeling guilt or shame about current or past behavior, discouraging the sharing of personalized stories in a whole-class setting.
• Safeguarding: Teachers must be knowledgeable about school child protection procedures and the Designated Safeguarding Lead. Support must be signposted using tools like the Circles of Support resource, which directs pupils to trusted adults both inside and outside the school.
• Whole School Approach: The lessons should be supported by a whole school approach where staff reflect on their own attitudes and assumptions about gender and actively embed the learning through ""teachable moments"" throughout the school year.","• Gender Stereotypes / Limiting Gender Stereotypes

"The International Men and Gender Equality Survey: A status report on men, women, and gender equality in 15 headlines.",https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMAGES-Headlines_2022.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is a global status report published by Equimundo (formerly Promundo-US), drawing on harmonized data from the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES), one of the most comprehensive studies investigating men's and women's practices and attitudes related to gender equality. The analysis synthesizes data from 67,202 respondents across 32 countries. The primary goal of IMAGES is to inform, drive, and monitor efforts to promote gender equality, particularly at the government policy level, recognizing that progress has stalled due to inequitable power, privilege, and gender norms related to men and masculinities.
The report presents key findings summarized in 15 headlines that demonstrate both inertia and opportunities for change:
Key Findings on Inequality and Norms
• Intergenerational Influence and Care: Many adults grew up witnessing male domination in household decision-making. Globally, women perform three to ten times as much unpaid care and domestic work as men. Men's own participation in domestic work remains highly unequal, and men often report higher rates of shared care than women acknowledge. Crucially, the data affirm that men whose fathers were involved in caregiving are significantly more involved themselves as adults, suggesting that positive parental modeling creates change for future generations.
• Attitudes and Privilege: Restrictive and inequitable ideas about manhood are widespread. Unlike younger women, younger men often do not hold significantly more equitable attitudes than older men. Many men support equality in the abstract but defend their patriarchal privilege in practice, showing low support for concrete challenges to the status quo, such as quotas for women in executive positions. Homophobic attitudes are also strongly supported when the issue is framed personally (e.g., being ashamed of a homosexual son).
• Economic Independence and Power: Household decision-making is more equitable when women have greater education and economic independence (formal employment). However, unequal power persists, particularly concerning financial decisions and women’s mobility (women rarely report having the final say on how they spend their own free time).
Violence and Health Outcomes
• The Cycle of Violence: A large proportion of respondents experienced multiple and overlapping forms of violence during childhood (physical violence and/or witnessing violence against their mother). This exposure is among the strongest predictors of adult behavior: men who witnessed violence against their mothers were significantly more likely to use intimate partner violence (IPV) in their own adult relationships. IPV perpetration, including psychological, physical, and sexual violence, remains extremely high globally.
• Health Costs of Masculinity: Adhering to restrictive gender attitudes is strongly associated with poor health outcomes for men, including increased binge drinking, higher rates of depressive feelings, and avoidance of health-seeking behavior.
• The Provider/Protector Stress: Men experience widespread stress related to the expectation that they be the financial ""provider"" and ""protector"". This stress is particularly high in conflict-affected regions or areas with economic instability, where structural forces make fulfilling these traditional roles impossible.
Opportunities for Action
The report emphasizes that change requires a ""both/and"" approach that addresses the harms of inequality for both men and women. Key recommendations urge governments to use IMAGES data to integrate gender-transformative approaches across all sectors (health, education, employment). Specific areas for male engagement include implementing equitable parental leave policies and leveraging men's existing involvement in Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) services, such as antenatal care (ANC) visits, as an entry point into the health system. Civil society and the research community are urged to continue pushing back against anti-feminist backlash with evidence showing that gender equality benefits everyone.","• International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES)

"Addressing the impact of Masculinity Influencers on Teenage Boys: A guide for schools, teachers and parents/guardians.",https://antibullyingcentre.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DCU-Influencer-Resource.pdf,"This is not an Equimundo resource. But it is helpful. 
Summary of the Source
This guide provides information and practical guidance for schools, teachers, and parents/guardians on addressing the rising influence of online masculinity influencers and associated harmful digital cultures, particularly among teenage boys (aged 13–18). The content acknowledges that these online phenomena are current manifestations of a broader ""ecosystem"" of pre-existing gendered power dynamics and inequalities.
The Nature and Impact of Harmful Influencers
The document highlights the significant reach of figures like Andrew Tate, whose content ranges from motivational health and fitness to explicitly misogynistic, homophobic, sexist, and conspiratory ideologies. This content promotes restrictive and oppressive forms of masculinity, often equating male success with wealth, material possessions, physical strength, and dominance over women.
Key elements promoted by these influencers include:
• Emotional Stoicism: Advocating the suppression of emotions and denying the existence of mental health struggles.
• Misogynistic Language: Using derogatory terms (e.g., AWALT, THOT, Simp, Beta male) and rhetoric that blames feminism for men's problems (gender backlash) and advocates for a return to a patriarchal society.
• Violence-Supportive Attitudes: Studies link exposure to this content with a higher acceptability of physical violence among young people. Misogynistic rhetoric is reported to lead to boys harassing and belittling women teachers and making derogatory remarks about girls in school settings (e.g., ""Make me a sandwich"").
Why Boys Engage and Key Challenges
The appeal of these influencers is not straightforward cause-and-effect but stems from complex, intersecting factors. Influencers capitalize on genuine challenges faced by young men:
• Mental Health Vulnerabilities: Algorithms suggest misogynistic content to boys searching for content related to loneliness, low self-esteem, or mental health issues, exploiting their psychological vulnerabilities.
• Socio-Economic Anxiety: Changes in the labor market and economic insecurity connect with traditional masculine identities centered on the 'provider' role. Influencers promise simplistic solutions for acquiring wealth.
• Changing Gender Dynamics: Destabilization of patriarchal norms and the #MeToo movement have led some boys to feel alienated, ignored, or blamed for the actions of other men. Influencers offer an idealized and ""celebratory version of masculinity"".
Guidance for Educational Interventions
The resource advocates for a balanced, nuanced approach that does not solely attribute harm to digital media but focuses on the underlying cultural systems. Key guidance principles include:
• Focus on the Ecosystem: Targeted interventions should examine the broad systems and structures that reproduce gendered inequalities, not just individual influencers.
• Critical Thinking and Agency: Educational interventions must focus on providing critical thinking and reflection skills to enable boys to recognize harmful ideas themselves, rather than merely telling them the content is bad. It is crucial to acknowledge that young men have agency and are capable of critique.
• Positive and Empathetic Approach: Facilitators must use a positive affirmative approach, avoiding pejorative terms like ""toxic masculinity"". Discussions should be non-judgmental and empathetic, aiming to create a safe space where boys feel heard and can discuss their anxieties.
• Facilitator Preparation: Facilitators must engage in training, thoroughly prepare, and maintain self-reflexivity regarding their own gendered beliefs to model gender equality and constructive dialogue.
• Curriculum Themes: Discussions should address key themes like mental health and emotional stoicism (promoting help-seeking), challenging the rigid idea of the ""successful man"" (promoting positive aspirations and values), and critically examining regressive gendered roles.
• Whole-School Approach: Schools should implement a long-term whole-school approach that proactively builds a culture of respectful and gender-equitable relations through policy, training, curriculum (including critical media and digital literacy), and empowering students","• Masculinity Influencers / Online Influencers

"HOW TO DO PROGRAMS: A GUIDE ON MANUAL ADAPTATION, CREATING A TRAINING AGENDA, AND BUDGETING",NOT ONLINE,"Summary of the Source
This document is a foundational programmatic guide from Promundo intended for all Program Staff involved in managing gender-transformative programs engaging men and boys for gender equality. Its purpose is to systematize and strengthen the quality of work by setting standards for design, implementation, and evaluation.
Core Principles and Theory of Change
Promundo’s work is underpinned by several key assumptions aimed at fundamental social change:
• Masculinities Lens: Conducting an analysis of how patriarchal power influences harmful outcomes and creating programmatic solutions to promote gender equality.
• Critical Reflection: Emulating Paulo Freire’s ""conscientization"" process, which actively engages men and boys (and women and girls) in critical reflections about power, patriarchy, and male privilege.
• Women’s Agency: Designing programs that specifically serve to strengthen women’s agency, voice, and choices.
• Socio-Ecological Model: Recognizing that structural inequalities limit individual-level change and aiming to operate at all levels (individual, relational, community, societal) to create an enabling environment for change.
• Duration: Programs are typically long in duration, with the manual covering 10–16 sessions and often accompanied by complementary components like campaigns lasting 6–9 months.
Section 1: Manual Adaptation
Adaptation is necessary to ensure content and delivery are relevant and effective. The process is ideally participatory, working with local partners as equals and experts. The guide details a seven-step process:
1. Establish Goals: Aligning the program with its Theory of Change and identifying the target population (age, gender identities, etc.).
2. Formative Research (Step 2): Conduct qualitative research (Focus Groups, In-depth Interviews, Key Informant Interviews) and desk reviews to understand local gender norms, attitudes, and social sanctions. Research protocols must ensure confidentiality and provide a list of referral services. Always interview women, even if the program focuses on men, to understand their perspectives and potential risks.
3. Development and Structure: The manual uses an active, reflective discussion approach, not lecturing. Manuals should follow a clear structure (Purpose, Objectives, Procedure, Key Messages) and use simple, direct text to avoid jargon, making it readable at a secondary school level or lower.
4. Pilot Testing (Step 6): Testing the curriculum and M&E tools with local partners to confirm contextual relevance and logistical viability. Common changes involve re-arranging session order, simplifying language, or changing case studies.
Section 2: Creating a Training Agenda
Promundo conducts several types of training: Gender Sensitization (Gender 101), Training of Trainers (ToT), Training of Facilitators (ToF), and Refresher Trainings. The ideal training size is 15–20 people.
• Facilitator Profile: The ideal facilitator is a guide who conveys authenticity, sincerity, empathy, and humility. They must possess excellent communication and organizational skills and be able to make others feel safe discussing sensitive topics.
• Methodology: Training agendas should include establishing a Group Agreement, using a Values Clarification activity, and employing the teach-back methodology where participants practice facilitating sessions and receive constructive critiques. Ongoing support mechanisms, including scheduled check-ins and refresher trainings, must be budgeted for, as one training is generally insufficient for high-quality implementation.
Section 3: Programs Budgeting
The guide provides detailed staff time and budget estimates for the four main phases of project management: Formative Research (22–39 days for a responsible staff member), Training (11–28 days for a responsible staff member per training), Manual Development (20–39 days for responsible Program staff), and M&E + Final Deliverables. This helps teams budget time for research, reporting, and monitoring activities like session observations and attendance tracking.","• Gender-Transformative Programs

A GUIDE FOR FACILITATING AND PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY (YOUTH POWER Toolkit),https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/English-Manual-Toolkit-for-CEPAM-G%C2%B4s-Youg-Power_FINAL.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is a Toolkit or manual for training Youth Power Facilitators (Facilitadores Juveniles Power), co-created between February and August 2024 by the youth network Jóvenes Power, CEPAM Guayaquil (a feminist organization in Ecuador), and Equimundo. The project was funded by Global Affairs Canada.
The Toolkit is designed for young people who already have a foundation in comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) or gender-based violence (GBV) prevention. Its purpose is to teach them how to conduct youth-to-youth peer processes (workshops and activities) to promote gender equality. The manual is unique due to its youth-friendly style, incorporating slang, idioms, emojis, and references to youth culture (including Latinx youth style).
Core Concepts and Theory (Chapter 1)
The manual provides theoretical content organized into ""Power Concepts"":
• Patriarchy and Machismo: It defines patriarchy as a traditional system where men hold key positions of power, and emphasizes the concept of heteropatriarchy, which enforces heterosexuality and results in discrimination against women and LGBTQI+ people. Machismo (sexism) is defined as the cultural attitudes that reinforce this male superiority. The document notes that the patriarchal system imposes significant costs on all members of society, including normalizing violence.
• Gender Identity: It explains the relationship and difference between sex and gender (gender being a social construct). It also covers diverse gender identities such as CIS, TRANS, non-binary, queer, and intersexual.
• Feminism and Intersectionality: Feminism is presented as social and political movements that fight against the oppression of patriarchy and seek equal rights for all people. Intersectionality is introduced as the sociological theory explaining how categories like ethnicity, social class, and gender interact to create systematic inequality.
• Violence and Relationships: The manual addresses Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in various forms, including dating violence and gender-based violence at school (such as sexual harassment and cyberbullying). It concludes the chapter with guidance on Healthy Lives and Relationships, focusing on concepts like self-esteem, self-care, and emotional/interpersonal intelligence.
Methodology and Facilitation (Chapter 2)
The Toolkit advocates for an approach that breaks away from traditional, monotonous education. The core methods and approaches are:
• Popular Education: Based on the work of Paulo Freire (""conscientization""), aiming to transform society toward equality and justice by using participants' existing knowledge.
• Experiential Methodology: Based on the experience and beliefs of the participants, fostering connection, dialogue, and personal rethinking.
• Gender Transformative Approach (GTA): The primary framework, which encourages the critical examination of gender inequalities and norms to transform the underlying structures that perpetuate them.
• Playful Learning Approach: Using fun and engaging dynamics to reinforce learning and transformation.
The facilitator is viewed as a guide, responsible for creating a safe and welcoming environment. The guide offers practical Tips for Power Facilitation, including managing sensitive topics, avoiding re-traumatization, and using referral services for emotional support.
Participatory Activities (Chapter 3 & 4)
The manual distinguishes between participatory methods (the path, e.g., Training Workshop, Debates, Film Forum) and educational techniques (the means, e.g., role-play, group work, brainstorming).
It provides five gender-transformative activities designed for peer facilitation:
1. Cultural Models of Men and Women: Activity focusing on how society constructs sex and gender and assigns value.
2. Sculpting Power: Activity using human sculptures to analyze the difference between Power Over (domination) and positive power forms (Power With, Power To, Inner Power).
3. How Do We Learn Violence? (Children's Games): Activity analyzing how games reinforce gender stereotypes and normalize aggression or submission.
4. Let’s Talk About Sex: Activity designed to discuss sexualities and SRHR without shame.
5. Healthy and Unhealthy Relationships: Activity identifying healthy behaviors (respect, equality, trust) versus unhealthy behaviors (abuse, violence) in dating, emphasizing that consent is the most important thing.","• Youth Power Toolkit / Jóvenes Power

Lifting Barriers - Global Resources for Engaging Boys in Education: Boys’ Club for Gender Equality Implementation Guide,"DRAFT, not published online yet","Summary of the Source
This document is the Boys’ Club for Gender Equality Implementation Guide, developed as part of the Lifting Barriers - Global Resources for Engaging Boys in Education initiative. The project was developed by Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice with support from UNESCO and the University of East Anglia, funded by the Global Partnership for Education’s Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE-KIX).
Core Purpose and Approach
The guide is designed to support facilitators—including teachers, community and religious leaders, and NGO practitioners—in creating and sustaining Boys’ Clubs for boys aged 9 to 12 in upper primary education settings.
The core rationale is that harmful and restrictive masculine gender norms contribute to boys’ disengagement from education, leading to low academic performance, violence, and poor mental health. The Boys' Clubs aim to complement, not compete with, efforts focused on girls' education, by challenging these norms and fostering inclusive spaces that benefit all learners.
The methodology is explicitly gender-transformative and asset-based. This asset-based approach shifts the focus from viewing boys as ""problems to be fixed"" to recognizing their strengths, leadership potential, and capacity for growth, nurturing their existing sense of fairness and empathy.
Facilitation, Safety, and Training
Effective facilitation is central to the club's success. Key guidance points for facilitators include:
• Creating a Safe and Inclusive Space: This involves setting Group Agreements (Code of Conduct) and using icebreakers and energizers to build group cohesion.
• Self-Reflection on Bias: Facilitators are urged to reflect on their own unconscious biases regarding gender stereotyping, emotional expression, and cultural background to ensure an inclusive, non-judgmental environment.
• Retention Strategies: To maintain long-term engagement, strategies include fostering a strong sense of belonging, making meetings interactive and fun, recognizing milestones, and building strong relationships with families and communities.
• Responding to Violence: A Special Facilitator Guidance Note provides step-by-step instructions for responsibly handling Disclosures of Violence. These steps stress listening calmly, not promising confidentiality, avoiding investigative questions, and immediately following mandatory reporting laws and school child protection procedures.
Curriculum Structure and Themes
The curriculum is delivered over 12 monthly themes, designed to reinforce learning through structured activities and supplementary exercises.
Key session themes include:
• Month 1 (Gender Equality and Manhood): Session 1, Breaking Out of the Box, explores the Man Box framework and harmful gender norms.
• Month 2 (Violence Prevention): Session 2 teaches about the types of violence, the connection between power and control, and strategies for safe intervention.
• Month 3 (Value of Education and Goal Setting): Session 3, The Bridge to Your Future, focuses on overcoming obstacles to staying in school and setting personal and educational goals.

ENGAGING MEN FOR GENDER EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE,https://www.equimundo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USAID-Engaging-Men-in-Gender-Equality-July-2023.pdf,"Summary of the Source
This document is a training manual developed by Tetra Tech in partnership with Equimundo, with financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The manual is specifically designed for USAID’s Engendering Industries program, which focuses on working with organizations in traditionally male-dominated industries to increase economic opportunities for women and improve gender equality, diversity, and inclusion in the workplace. The manual was developed with input from partner organizations in the Dominican Republic (EDESur), Nigeria (IBEDC), and India (BRPL).
Program Goals and Focus
The goal of the manual is to engage men through dialogue and reflection to promote healthy masculinity and attitudes that reflect equality, respect, collaboration, and allyship with women. It aims to foster analysis of how gender norms create inequality and reinforce patriarchal values and practices within organizations. The underlying commitment of the Engendering Industries program is to foster enterprise-driven innovation, inclusive economic growth, and gender equality.
Methodology and Structure
The manual is structured around a gender-transformative group education process, utilizing participatory methodologies and experiential learning approaches derived from rigorously evaluated programs.
The content is organized into ten thematic units:
1. Introductions.
2. Gender Basics (Activity 2.2 covers Sex, Gender, Gender Equality, and Gender Equity).
3. Gender Socialization, Roles, Norms (including activity to Unpack the Man Box and My Father’s Impact, My Mother’s Impact).
4. The Gendered Division of Work (exploring care work and its value).
5. Power (including activities like the Power Walk and Power Flower, emphasizing intersecting identities like gender, race, and class).
6. Gender-Based Violence (GBV).
7. Sexual Exploitation, Abuse, and Harassment (SEAH), specifically in the workplace.
8. Allyship for Healthy and Inclusive Workplaces (including Bystander Intervention and the Men’s Allyship Roadmap).
9. Interpersonal Communication Skills (including dealing with conflict using ""The Four Phrases"" and addressing Microaggressions).
10. Changes, Commitments (finalizing personal commitments and action plans).
Implementation and Facilitation
Facilitators are crucial and must be chosen for their strong communication and organizational skills, as well as their ability to make others feel safe discussing sensitive topics. Facilitators should see themselves as guides, not teachers. The sessions emphasize creating a safe space by establishing ground rules. Training sessions should incorporate ""Checking in and Out"" activities, where participants share reflections and make concrete commitments to action before the next session.
The manual also includes guidance on Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL), recommending pre- and post-testing to measure increases in participants' Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA) and shifts in attitudes. When addressing sensitive topics like GBV, the program utilizes a survivor-centered approach that prioritizes the victim's needs and returns power to them. The manual encourages inclusivity, acknowledging the limitations of the gender binary and the marginalization experienced by nonbinary, gender-nonconforming, and queer people.","• USAID / U.S. Agency for International Development

ifting Barriers - Global Resources for Engaging Boys in Education: Classroom Lesson Plans for Learners on Masculinities and Gender Equality,"DRAFT, not published online yet","Summary of the Source
This document is a foundational set of 10 gender-transformative, interactive, and participatory Lesson Plans developed by Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice with support from UNESCO and the University of East Anglia, under the Global Partnership for Education’s Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE-KIX).
Program Rationale and Approach
The resource is designed for educators (teachers, teacher trainers, teaching assistants) working with upper primary school learners (roughly ages 9 to 12 years old). The curriculum's primary purpose is to address Boys' Disengagement from Education, a situation caused in part by harmful and restrictive masculine gender norms that discourage boys from educational success (e.g., viewing reading or academic achievement as ""feminine"").
The approach is built on two key methodologies:
1. Gender-Transformative Approach: This involves working with learners to critically reflect on and challenge the root causes of gender inequality and the harmful attitudes that drive disengagement.
2. Asset-Based Approach: This shifts the focus from treating boys as ""problems to be fixed"" to recognizing their existing strengths, leadership potential, and capacity for growth.
While the lessons address gender-specific challenges boys face, they are intended to be used with all learners, regardless of their gender identity, to create a more inclusive and equitable learning environment that benefits everyone. Strengthening boys' engagement is viewed as complementing, not competing with, existing efforts to promote girls' education.
Curriculum Content and Structure
The 10 Lesson Plans are designed to slowly build understanding through diverse pedagogical techniques such as role-playing, discussions, debates, and self-reflection. Each lesson contains three 20-minute activities, making the recommended length of one lesson one hour.
Key lesson topics include:
• Creating a Caring Space (establishing a Group Agreement).
• Understanding Gender and Gender Stereotypes (analyzing how rigid expectations harm girls and boys).
• Learning About Masculinities: Includes the core activities The Man Box, The Woman Box, and The Human Box to explore societal expectations and identify positive qualities.
• Succeeding In School: Focuses on practical skills like setting goals and time management (balancing ""Want To's"" and ""Have To's"").
• Ending Bullying Behavior: Explores power dynamics (""Exploring Power"") and the consequences of school violence, while promoting safe intervention strategies.
• Understanding My Emotions: Uses activities like Making My Mask of Emotions to normalize the healthy expression of feelings, which are often limited by gender stereotypes.
• Communication – Asking for Help: Emphasizes that asking for help is a sign of strength and includes role-playing scenarios for seeking support from adults or peers.
• My Academic Support System: The final lesson focuses on celebrating achievements and building a Support Network.
Implementation Guidance
The guide recommends that the educator's role is to act as a guide and create a safe environment, encouraging discussion and modeling behavior, rather than being a subject matter ""expert"". Educators should use a whole school approach in conjunction with other resources (such as the Educator’s Guide and Parent Engagement Guide) and be prepared to address defensiveness and backlash by promoting critical thinking and empathy rather than validating discriminatory comments.","• Lifting Barriers - Global Resources for Engaging Boys in Education

Guide to Working with Parents and Caregivers to Support Boys’ Education.,"DRAFT, not published online yet","Summary of the Source
This document is a resource guide designed by Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice, with support from UNESCO and the University of East Anglia, under the Global Partnership for Education’s Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE-KIX). The guide is specifically intended for educators, schools, and key stakeholders working with parents and caregivers of upper primary school learners (roughly ages 9 to 12).
Rationale and Gender-Transformative Context
The guide aims to complement existing efforts to promote girls' education and gender equality by addressing the specific challenges boys face that impact their learning and well-being. It highlights that gendered norms and expectations in families, communities, and schools undermine boys' motivation and desire to learn. Masculine norms and stereotypes often discourage boys from achieving academic success. By challenging these restrictive masculine norms, schools can foster more inclusive spaces that benefit girls through more equitable learning environments.
The guide operates under the premise that engaging parents and caregivers to foster more gender equitable norms is critical because the home environment can either reinforce stereotypes or support gender-transformative education.
Programmatic Approach and Methodology
The guide is designed to be used in conjunction with other Lifting Barriers global resources, such as the Educators’ Guide, In-Classroom Modules, and Boys Clubs.
Key recommendations for working with parents include:
• Asset-Based Approach: Educators should emphasize the strengths, leadership potential, and capacity for growth in boys, rather than treating them as problems to be fixed.
• Collaboration: Parents should be viewed as partners in education, and their insights should be valued.
• Transparency: Schools should hold at least two Parent Meetings during the school year (one before the initiative starts, and a second to share positive impact) to inform them about topics covered (like gender stereotypes, bullying, and building communication skills) and to prepare them for potential behavior change in their children (e.g., a son wanting to help with dishes).
The guide explains that boys’ disengagement has serious consequences, including limiting future career opportunities, increasing risky behaviors (substance use, mental health struggles), and affecting family well-being.
Tips for Parents and Role of Fathers
The document provides concrete tips for parents to create more gender-equitable homes and support boys' education:
• Equitable Home Practices: Encourage free self-expression and play with a range of activities, including those traditionally seen ""for girls,"" as well as gender-neutral toys. Model and encourage empathy, celebrate diverse interests, and be an emotional support system where boys feel safe sharing feelings without judgment.
• Educational Support: Encourage a ""growth mindset"" (praising effort over results), create a structured learning environment, and embrace reading at home.
• Positive Discipline: Parents should avoid harsh punishments and instead use positive discipline (clear expectations, consistent consequences, and open communication).
• Fathers' Role: Fathers and male caregivers are highlighted as playing a critical role in shaping boys' attitudes. They should be invited to meetings and encouraged to model gender equality by fairly dividing household work and caregiving responsibilities, demonstrating empathy, and teaching their children about boundaries and consent.","• Lifting Barriers

Lifting Barriers - Global Resources for Engaging Boys in Education: An Educator’s Guide for Educating Boys,"DRAFT, not published online yet","Summary of the Source
This document is the Educator's Guide for the Lifting Barriers - Global Resources for Engaging Boys in Education initiative, developed by Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice with support from UNESCO and the University of East Anglia through the Global Partnership for Education’s Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE-KIX).
Core Purpose and Approach
The guide's overall purpose is to provide educators (including teachers and teacher trainers) with the information and recommendations necessary to challenge the limiting gender norms that drive boys' disengagement from education and, in the process, create more inclusive, gender-transformative learning environments for all learners. It is specifically targeted at those working with upper primary school learners (roughly ages 9 to 12 years old).
The approach is designed to complement, not compete with, existing efforts to promote girls' education and gender equality. By strengthening boys' engagement and challenging harmful and restrictive masculine norms, schools simultaneously create more equitable learning environments for girls.
The framework uses two key concepts:
1. Gender-Transformative Approach: Actively working with learners to challenge the root causes of gender inequality and embrace more gender-equitable alternatives.
2. Asset-Based Approach: Shifting the focus from treating boys as problems to be fixed to recognizing their strengths and capacity to reach their academic potential.
Factors and Consequences of Boys’ Disengagement (Part 1)
Boys globally, across all income regions, are at greater risk than girls of repeating grades, failing to progress, and not achieving adequate learning, especially at the upper secondary level. The disengagement is driven by complex factors operating at five levels:
• Individual: Boys may believe that asking for help is ""unmanly"" or that achieving academically is incompatible with masculinity.
• Family: Economic pressure may lead vulnerable boys to feel pressure to drop out for employment to fulfill the expectation to earn money.
• Peer: Boys may face peer pressure to join gangs, engage in drug/alcohol abuse, or avoid activities perceived as ""feminine,"" like reading.
• School: Disengagement can result from educators' poor gender attitudes, authoritarian teaching styles, use of harsh punishment (which is often gendered in practice), and curricula that do not match boys' interests.
• Wider Society: Factors include poverty, conflict, lack of educational policies promoting gender parity, and the influence of social media’s hyper-masculine spaces that emphasize wealth and rebellion over academic success.
The consequences of disengagement include poorer economic outcomes, worse health and well-being, and the perpetuation of worse gender attitudes and relationships (including perpetrating violence). Disengagement also creates a challenging teaching environment, leading to teacher stress and burnout.
Gender-Transformative Practice (Parts 2, 3, 4)
The guide outlines practical steps for educators:
• Understanding Gender: Distinguishing between Biological Sex and Gender (socially assigned roles) and recognizing how patriarchy and restrictive masculine norms (such as avoiding emotional expression or viewing certain subjects like literacy or arts as ""feminine"") impede boys' learning.
• Unpacking Biases: Educators must reflect on their own gender attitudes and practices. Practices like telling boys ""Don't cry,"" punishing boys more harshly than girls (which is linked to early exit from schooling), or holding girls accountable for boys' disruptive behavior reinforce inequality. The guide recommends using a Self-Reflection Table to identify and address these biases.
• Inclusive Teaching:
    ◦ Using Gender-Inclusive Language, avoiding stereotypical phrases (""We need a strong man to open that"").
    ◦ Employing Motivational Interviewing Techniques (open-ended questions, active listening, positive feedback) to engage disengaged learners.
    ◦ Ending the use of corporal punishment and replacing it with positive discipline and conflict resolution techniques.
    ◦ Addressing Bullying in Schools, including homophobic and transphobic bullying, by teaching allyship and providing safe intervention strategies.
    ◦ Incorporating engaging methods like Book Clubs, Peer Teaching, Role Plays, and Story Telling to foster cooperation, critical thinking, and empathy.
    ◦ Adjusting Classroom Arrangements (e.g., circular seating, flexible arrangements) to encourage mixed-gender interaction and equality spaces.
• Addressing Resistance: Strategies are provided for addressing misinformation and potential gender backlash from students or caregivers, emphasizing hearing their concerns calmly and challenging harmful views by encouraging debate.
The guide also stresses the importance of an Enabling Environment, including national policies, ministerial support, strong teacher networks, and school leadership that prioritize gender equality.","• Lifting Barriers - Global Resources for Engaging Boys in Education

Manual de Facilitación: Programa Apapáchar,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SqCGw-vvCtFPgQiYpWzLd7FvFMmsjwqv/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110342786410802326792&rtpof=true&sd=true  ,"The ""Manual de Facilitación: Programa Apapáchar"" is a comprehensive guide for implementing a 12-week hybrid parenting program aimed at caregivers of children aged 0-5 in Colombia. Developed through a collaboration between Fundación Apapacho, Equimundo, CINDE, and the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF), its core mission is to prevent violence against children and intimate partner violence by promoting sensitive, loving, and non-violent caregiving, as well as co-responsible parenting.
The manual is structured to support facilitators in delivering the program, which combines digital content (80%) via gender-separate WhatsApp groups with in-person reinforcement sessions (20%). The content is organized into four thematic levels, each lasting three weeks: 1) Recognizing Ourselves at Home, 2) Discovering Play and Emotions, 3) Strengthening Communication and Routines at Home, and 4) Resolving Conflicts and Challenges for Greater Well-being.

Theoretical foundations are rooted in early childhood development, socio-ecological and equality-based perspectives, and neuroscience. The program emphasizes that loving, sensitive, and prejudice-free care acts as a protective shield against violence. It intentionally engages fathers and male caregivers to foster affectionate, co-responsible, and non-violent fatherhood, while also involving mothers and female caregivers to transform family dynamics.

The facilitator's role is crucial for creating safe, trusting spaces for dialogue and reflection. The manual provides detailed guidance on facilitation strategies for both digital and in-person sessions, including how to handle resistance, emotional intensity, and group conflicts. It offers weekly scripts with specific messages, media (images, videos), and discussion prompts for the WhatsApp groups, alongside plans for the complementary in-person meetings.

Logistical instructions cover creating WhatsApp groups, enrolling participants, and managing content delivery. The manual is designed to be flexible, allowing facilitators to adapt content to the specific needs and contexts of the participating families while maintaining the program's core objectives.","Parenting Program

"Lifting Barriers - Global Resources for Engaging Boys in Education 
Boys’ Club for Gender Equality Implementation Guide
",Revisions Complete_BOYS CLUB CURRICULUM,"The Boys’ Club for Gender Equality Implementation Guide is part of the ""Lifting Barriers"" project, developed to address boys’ disengagement from education by challenging harmful masculine norms. Funded by the Global Partnership for Education’s Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, the guide provides a structured, 12-month curriculum for facilitators working with boys aged 9–12 in or out of school.

The guide begins by framing boys’ educational disengagement as a gendered issue influenced by restrictive masculine norms, which can lead to dropout and poor academic outcomes. It emphasizes a gender-transformative and asset-based approach—viewing boys not as problems but as individuals with strengths and potential. The curriculum is designed to complement, not compete with, existing efforts for girls’ education, aiming to create more equitable learning environments for all.

The core of the guide is a series of monthly themes and activities. Each month focuses on a specific topic, starting with onboarding (Month 0) and covering subjects such as gender equality and manhood, the value of education, effective communication, health and puberty, drugs and alcohol awareness, emotional and mental health, digital literacy, violence prevention, study techniques, relationships, financial management, and a final wrap-up. Each theme includes a main structured session (1–1.5 hours) and optional supplemental activities to reinforce learning.

Detailed facilitator guidance is provided throughout, covering how to form and run a Boys’ Club, prepare for sessions, create safe and inclusive spaces, and employ strategies for meaningful discussion and participant retention. A special section offers guidance on sensitively responding to disclosures of violence from children.

The guide is highly adaptable, offering a ""traffic light"" system (Green, Yellow, Red) to help facilitators modify content, pedagogy, and delivery while maintaining the program's core objectives. It is designed for use by teachers, community leaders, and NGO practitioners and can be adapted for mixed-gender groups if appropriate. The ultimate goal is to empower boys with critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and a deeper understanding of gender dynamics, fostering their educational engagement and contributing to a more just and equitable society.

Classroom Lesson Plans for Learners on Masculinities and Gender
Equality",Revisions Complete_CLASSROOM RESOURCE-Revised Aug 2025.docx,"The document “Lifting Barriers – Global Resources for Engaging Boys in Education” is a comprehensive classroom resource developed by UNESCO, Equimundo, and the University of East Anglia. It provides 10 interactive lesson plans designed to address the growing global issue of boys’ disengagement from education—a phenomenon driven by social, economic, and rigid gender norms. The resource takes a gender-transformative approach, aiming not only to support boys’ academic engagement but also to challenge harmful masculine stereotypes and promote gender equality for all learners.

The lesson plans are intended for upper primary students (ages 9–12) and cover a range of topics: creating safe classroom spaces, understanding gender and stereotypes, exploring masculinities, building time management skills, emotional literacy, ending bullying, effective communication, fostering positive friendships, and building academic support systems. Each plan includes three 20-minute activities, teaching tips, and guidance for adaptation to local contexts.

A central theme is the recognition that harmful and restrictive masculinities—such as pressure to be tough, avoid emotions, or view academic effort as “feminine”—significantly hinder boys’ motivation and success in school. The resource emphasizes an asset-based approach, focusing on boys’ strengths and potential rather than framing them as problems. It encourages educators to foster inclusive, caring environments where boys feel safe to express themselves, seek help, and build positive relationships.

The guide also promotes a whole-school approach, urging collaboration with school leadership, parents, and the wider community to embed gender equality into policies and practices. It acknowledges that efforts to engage boys should complement, not compete with, ongoing work to support girls’ education.

In addition to the lesson plans, the “Lifting Barriers” project includes an Educator’s Guide, a Parents’ Engagement Guide, a Boys’ Club Implementation Guide, and guidance for gender-responsive teaching materials. The ultimate goal is to create safer, more equitable learning environments where all students—regardless of gender—can thrive academically and personally.","Boys’ disengagement from education

"Lifting Barriers - Global Resources for Engaging Boys in EducationAn Educator’s Guide for Educating Boys",Revisions Complete_EDUCATOR'S GUIDE-Revised Aug 2025,"This educator's guide, ""Lifting Barriers,"" provides a framework for addressing boys' disengagement from education through a gender-transformative lens. It argues that harmful masculine norms—such as pressure to be emotionally stoic, independent, and dismissive of ""feminine"" subjects—can negatively impact boys' motivation, participation, and academic outcomes.

The guide is structured to help educators first understand the complex, multi-level factors driving boys' disengagement, from individual and peer pressures to school policies and societal norms. It emphasizes self-reflection, encouraging educators to examine their own gender biases and teaching practices that may unintentionally reinforce stereotypes. A core principle is adopting an ""asset-based approach,"" shifting from viewing boys as problems to be fixed to recognizing their strengths and potential as agents of positive change.

The practical section offers concrete strategies for creating more inclusive classrooms. This includes using gender-inclusive language, implementing motivational interviewing techniques, designing cooperative learning activities, arranging classrooms to promote interaction, and critically reviewing lesson plans and materials for gender bias. It also provides guidance on ending corporal punishment, addressing bullying (including homophobic and transphobic bullying), and navigating potential resistance to gender equality efforts from students or the community. Ultimately, the guide positions engaging boys not as a zero-sum game, but as a complementary strategy that fosters safer, more equitable learning environments for all students.

"Lifting Barriers - Global Resources for Engaging Boys in Education
Guide to Working with Parents and Caregivers to Support Boys’ Education",Revisions Complete_PARENTS GUIDE RESOURCE_Revised Aug 2025,"The ""Lifting Barriers – Guide to Working with Parents and Caregivers to Support Boys’ Education"" is a resource developed to complement global gender equality efforts by specifically addressing the rising issue of boys' disengagement from education. It is part of a UNESCO-led project, supported by the Global Partnership for Education, aiming to create safer and more equitable education systems by promoting positive masculinities.

The guide recognizes that while significant progress has been made in girls' education, boys in many regions face increasing risks of poor academic outcomes, grade repetition, and school dropout, particularly at the secondary level. This disengagement is driven by factors including restrictive masculine norms, inflexible teaching methods, and socio-economic pressures. The resource positions engaging parents and caregivers as a critical strategy for supporting boys' educational engagement and fostering more gender-equitable attitudes at home.

Primarily aimed at educators and school leaders, the guide provides a framework for building collaborative relationships with parents of upper-primary school children (ages 9-12). It emphasizes an asset-based approach—focusing on boys' strengths and potential rather than framing them as problems—and stresses that involving parents as partners is key to reinforcing school-based initiatives. A core argument is that improving boys' engagement benefits all learners by creating more focused, respectful, and equitable classroom environments, thereby advancing broader gender equality.

The guide offers practical recommendations for parents to create gender-equitable homes and support learning, such as encouraging free self-expression through play, modeling empathy, celebrating diverse interests, and fostering a growth mindset. It includes specific tips for supporting education, like embracing reading at home, creating structured study routines, and avoiding harsh punishments in favor of positive discipline. Special emphasis is placed on involving fathers and male caregivers as positive role models.

A central component is the detailed plan for conducting two parent meetings during the school year: one to introduce the initiative and a second to share positive impacts. These meetings are designed to build transparency, gather parent input, and demonstrate outcomes through testimonials and evidence. The guide also provides strategies for maintaining parent engagement throughout the year via regular communication, observation sessions, and volunteer opportunities. It concludes with an adaptable template for a parent handout, offering concise, actionable advice for supporting sons at home.

Overall, the guide presents a holistic, school-community partnership model to address boys' disengagement, positioning it not in opposition to girls' empowerment, but as an integral part of building truly inclusive, gender-transformative education systems for all children.
