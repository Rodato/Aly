the manual.

Dr. Felix SAYINZOGA

Executive Director

RWAMREC

We would like to thank the Rwandan Ministry of Health for their support for the Bandebereho program over the years, including in the development of this manual and for enabling the intervention to be taken to scale through the health sector.

The Bandebereho manual was originally adapted to the Rwandan context under the MenCare+ program. MenCare+ was a four-country initiative to engage men as caregiving partners in maternal, newborn and child health and sexual and reproductive health (20132015) coordinated by Rutgers WPF and Promundo, funded by the Dutch Ministry for Foreign Aff  airs. In Rwanda, MenCare+ was implemented by the Rwanda Men's Resource Center (RWAMREC), under the name 'Bandebereho'. RWAMREC is a Rwandan NGO with a mission to mobilize men to support women's leadership; to contribute to the eradication of men's violence against women; and to serve as role models for the promotion of positive masculine behaviors.

The current version of this manual was developed in 2019 and is designed to be implemented by trained community health workers via the Rwandan health system, with funding from DFID WOW and Saving Brains/Grand Challenges Canada. The creation of the manual was led by Kate Doyle and Shamsi KAZIMBAYA of Promundo-US and Silas NGAYABOSHYA and Emmanuel KARAMAGE of RWAMREC.

Special appreciation goes to Dr. Felix SAYINZOGA, Dr. Ferdinand BIKORIMANA, Mrs. Beatrice MUKAMANA and Mrs. Merab MUTONI at the Rwandan Ministry of Health in its Maternal Child Health and Community Health Division for their role in supporting the development of the manual and the scale-up of Bandebereho through the health sector. The development of the manual would also not have been possible without the invaluable ideas and input from the following individuals at RWAMREC: Jean Baptiste NSENGIMANA, Chantal MUHIMPUNDU, Raymond RUTABAYIRU, Consolée MUKESHIMANA, Lisette NYIRANEZA. A special thank you to Fidèle RUTAYISIRE, Gloria MUKANKURANGA for their support during the development of the manual.

## Introduction

This manual was adapted for use by community health workers for the scale-up of the Bandebereho couples' intervention via the health sector in Rwanda.

## What is Bandebereho?

The Bandebereho ('role model') intervention engages men in maternal and newborn health, violence prevention, caregiving, and healthier couple relations. The intervention uses fatherhood as an entry-point to work with men and couples to promote men's active, non-violent, and equitable involvement in their children's lives. Bandebereho is aimed at expectant couples and parents of young children ages 0 to 5. It takes a gendertransformative approach - meaning that participants critically question and reflect on gender norms, or the social expectations for women and men, and their impact on their roles as parents and partners. The intervention was adapted for the Rwandan context by the Rwanda Men's Resource Center (RWAMREC), in partnership with Promundo, following formative research, piloting, and input from the Rwanda Biomedical Center.

Bandebereho participants are invited to attend small group sessions of critical reflection, dialogue, and participatory activities that support men (and their partners) to adopt more equitable attitudes and behavior. The intervention creates safe spaces where fathers and mothers can receive valuable information, challenge inequitable gender attitudes and norms, and learn and practice new skills related to pregnancy, parenting, couple communication, and non-violent conflict resolution. Through the sessions, participants become aware of inequalities, reflect on the costs of rigid norms, and learn and practice new skills in a safe, non-judgmental peer environment, which can lead to changes across a range of health and relationship behaviors.

## Bandebereho pilot

From 2013-15, the Bandebereho intervention was implemented by RWAMREC with more than 1,700 couples in four districts (Karongi, Musanze, Nyaruguru, and Rwamagana) of Rwanda. Men were invited to attend all 15 sessions (maximum 45 hours) and their female partners were invited to participate in up to 8 couple sessions (maximum 24 hours). The intervention used an earlier 15-session version of this curriculum, facilitated by local fathers trained to recruit and implement the sessions with men and couples in their community. More than 3,000 parents were reached in the pilot between March 2014 and July 2015.

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted from 2015-2016 to assess the impact of the Bandebereho program in Rwanda. The fi  ndings of the RCT 1  demonstrated the intervention's impact across of range of outcomes - including improved antenatal care attendance by women and accompaniment by men, greater modern contraceptive use, and reductions in both intimate partner violence and violence against children.

## Transition-to-Scale

RWAMREC and Promundo, in collaboration with the Rwanda Biomedical Center, have sought to scale-up the Bandebereho intervention in light of its demonstrated impact. A multi-sectoral technical advisory group, led by the Rwanda Biomedical Center, identifi  ed the health system and community health workers as the best pathway for taking the intervention to scale in a sustainable and cost-eff  ective manner.

In 2019, RWAMREC and RBC, and with support from Promundo, began adapting and testing the delivery of Bandebereho through the health sector in Musanze district. The transition-to-scale phase aimed to test the feasibility of delivering the Bandebereho intervention with quality and fi  delity through Rwanda's community health system. The scale-up model capitalizes on the strength and extensive reach of Rwanda's cadre of community health workers. Some adaptations to the Bandebereho intervention have been made in the transition-to-scale phase, including further development of the curriculum to target greater impact on specifi  c outcomes - expanding from 15 to 17 sessions (10 for couples).

The sessions are designed to be implemented by pairs of trained community health workers on a weekly basis, with small groups of up to 12 couples (as in the original implementation). Two of the sessions are co-facilitated together with an animatrice de santé (pregnancy session) and the binomes (family planning session), respectively.

| Activities           | Most sessions include at least 2 participatory activities to be conducted with the group. The activities are broken down into the following parts: • Title and length: Each activity has a title, which you may choose to share with the group. The recommended for the activity is indicated next to the title. • Purpose: The purpose of each activity is indicated. The facilitator should share the purpose of the activity with the participants at the start of each activity. • Instructions: The steps for carrying out the activity. The activities are written to be easily adapted to groups with different reading and writing levels. The facilitator should be attentive to whether the steps are appropriate for the participants. • Group Discussion Questions: Most of the activities include group discussion questions to help guide the discussion on the activity topic. It is not necessary to discuss all the questions or to adhere to the order in which they are listed - they are merely for guidance. • Key Message: The key message to be shared and |
| Closing              | Each session ends with approximately 10-15 minutes where the facilitators can provide a recap of the session and participants can share their feedback on the session.

## Facilitating Bandebereho

The role of the facilitator is to create an open and respectful environment in which men and their partners can feel comfortable sharing and learning from each other. The activities are designed to allow men and their partners to learn through self-reflection and participation - a process that is delicately facilitated, not taught. The objective of the sessions is to initiate a process of critical thinking about gender and rights and the possibilities for promoting more equitable relationships between women and men. The activities will benefit from allowing men to share their own experiences and opinions.

As a facilitator, you should encourage the participants to share their own experiences in a positive way, but you should never use their experiences to criticize. In addition, there may be some men who will not want to talk. As a facilitator, you should never force anyone to participate in the activities. Instead, try to create an environment in which the participants feel comfortable to participate and share their experiences and opinions.

Many of the themes - violence, relationships - are complex and sensitive. You need to pay attention to the comfort level of the participants. In some cases, you may need to refer individuals to professional services or counseling. It is important to be sensitive to the practical realities of men's and women's lives and realize that they may face challenges or dangers when trying to make changes in their lives.

Remember, changing attitudes and behavior is a long process. Men's participation in these activities will not necessarily lead to an immediate transformation of their lives and relationships. It is the beginning of a process for promoting personal change and transformation.

## Facilitating mixed-sex groups

Many of the sessions are designed for men and women together. These sessions are designed to engage participants in critical reflection and to promote dialogue between men and women. Some activities may require men and women to participate in separate group discussions. This is done to make sure that both men and women feel comfortable to express their ideas and opinions, particularly on issues that may be sensitive to discuss in front of their partner. Through these activities, men and women may begin to feel more comfortable to communicate with each other.

The curriculum is designed to be facilitated by two facilitators, ideally one male and one female. While this is always dependent upon the availability and skills of facilitators in your

1

community, some of the sessions ask to separate men and women and recommend that these groups be facilitated by just a male facilitator (for the group of men) or just a female facilitator (for the group of women). This allows a bit more comfort during those sensitive conversations.

When facilitating with one female facilitator and one male facilitator, it is important to make sure that facilitators are modeling gender-equitable relationships. That means that you both are demonstrating the types of communication and sharing of decision-making that you are encouraging the participants to undertake. Some items to be careful of include:

- Facilitators should be dividing the work evenly. That means that one facilitator is not conducting all the sessions or doing most of the work. Activities should be divided evenly by facilitator (either by switching every other activity or switching every session).
- Be careful that female facilitators are not the ones taking notes or that male facilitators are not the ones leading the group discussions. This can inadvertently send the impression that male facilitators are more valuable than their female colleagues. Be sure to share these roles.
- Facilitators should be comfortable with one another and have a good working relationship and communication.
- Don't interrupt or cut one another off. Again, modeling the type of behavior you wish to see in participants is very important.
- Be sure to practice with one another before the session and divide up roles and activities well in advance. If you are unsure about whether your facilitation team is modeling gender-equitable relationships, practice in front of a colleague or a supervisor and get feedback from others.

## Tips for successful facilitation

Below are useful tips to help you lead the group sessions. These tips will help you to encourage and create a respectful environment where men and women will feel comfortable to share their own opinions and experiences, and to listen to and learn from others.

- Create a safe space: It is important for the group to be a space where participants feel safe and comfortable. The facilitator(s) and the participants should sit in a circle during the discussions to encourage exchange and equality. Part of creating a safe space is ensuring that men and women feel comfortable discussing with each other. There are some activities or sessions where it is advised for men and women to participate in separate, smaller groups. This is highlighted in the instructions for relevant activities.
- Remember the ground agreements: Ask participants to agree on a set of group

agreements and enforce them throughout the sessions. Important group agreements include listening to and showing respect for others (not talking when others are speaking, not making rude comments, or talking on the phone); confidentiality; and participation.

- Do not judge: Remember, you are here to facilitate discussion and reflection. Your role is not to teach or punish anyone. Be friendly and create rapport with your participants. Be aware of your own position of power and avoid judgmental and authoritarian attitudes. Never impose your feelings or opinions on the group.
- Promote inclusion: Ensure that all participants feel able to speak up. Be careful not to let one person dominate the conversation or make other people feel that they cannot share their own opinions. During the sessions with men and women, take extra care to ensure that the voices of men do not dominate. Encourage women to share their opinions and contribute to the discussion. If a participant begins to take over a group by spending too much time with a story, find an opening and kindly say, 'It sounds like you have a lot of valuable experiences to share with the group. That is great! Do others have similar or different stories they would also like to share?'
- Make sure that everyone in the group can participate: Some group members may have difficulties accessing the meeting venue or participating in all the activities - for example, people with disabilities, people with low literacy, pregnant women or people with a temporary health problem. The role of the facilitator is to make sure that all these individuals are included in the group meetings, by considering their physical accessibility needs, using different communication methods, emphasizing that the sessions aim to include all people, making sure other group members adopt inclusive and respectful behavior and communication.
- Ask questions that promote dialogue: See your group as a process. Ask 'process questions' or questions that cause participants to reflect more. These are questions that cannot be answered with a 'yes' or 'no' and that are unbiased.
- Address participants' concerns: The group meetings can serve as an important opportunity for participants to receive help and advice. At the beginning of each session there is a 'check-in' where men and women can share what is happening in their lives and ask for advice. As a facilitator, it is important that you validate the concerns that people have, but you can also engage the larger group in helping to propose solutions to the problems individuals are facing. Ask the group, 'How do you think this problem could be solved?' or 'Has anyone faced a similar situation? What did you do?'
- Know and use referral services: Some problems that participants are facing may require outside support. In addition, some participants may prefer to discuss a particular topic, obtain information, or seek support outside of a group setting, or may need attention from a specialized service provider. As a facilitator, you should be knowledgeable of places where you can refer participants if needed.

1

- Manage conflicts respectfully: If a conflict arises among the group, or if a participant shares a discriminatory view, remind the participants of the ground rules. Encourage other members to help mediate the situation. Ask the group what they think about the question raised or how they would suggest handling the problem. When necessary, you can offer brief responses to questions and clarifying misinformation.
- Appreciate honesty and openness: Encourage participants to be honest and open. They should not be afraid to discuss sensitive issues for fear of ridicule from their peers. Thank the group members for sharing their personal stories. Never force anyone to participate in the activities. Instead, try to create an environment in which the participants feel comfortable.
- Promote movement and interaction: Include as much physical movement as possible so that participants remain active, alert and interested. You are encouraged to use short energizer activities, such as songs or dances, in between activities to keep the participants engaged in the topics you are discussing. Remember to be mindful of any mobility restrictions that participants may have when selecting energizers.
- Manage your time: Keep track of time; do not spend more than about two hours on a given activity. Keep in mind participants' attention span and schedules. Use energizers to help transition between activities and keep participants motivated and alert.
- Ask for feedback: Use the weekly 'check-out' to receive regular feedback from participants: what do they like and dislike? What is working or not working? Use their input to improve the sessions. Do not divert from the planned activities but use feedback to improve the running of the sessions (for example, by including more energizers).
- Be respectful in presence: Try to be as respectful as possible in your appearance, nonverbal and verbal presentation. This includes the way you dress (avoiding clothes that distract), and address participants (work on remembering the participants' names - a simple name game can help with that).
- Be careful of topics that may cause re-traumatization: Given the sensitivity of the issues, it is possible that participants may bring up issues of personal trauma or abuse. It is important that at the beginning of each session, you remind participants that they are welcome to leave the room if they feel uncomfortable. They are not required to share any sensitive information. This should be repeated at the beginning of particularly sensitive activities. Remind them of the resources that are available to them and that you are available after the session to talk further. Refer participants to service providers with whom they can discuss any issues they may be having.
- Keep discussions from going too far off the key messages: One of the main facilitator tools you can use is the 'bank,' also known as the 'parking lot' . While all discussions are welcomed, if a participant brings up a topic that cannot be addressed

within the time allotted, write it on a flipchart paper called the 'bank' or 'parking lot' . It is important that these topics are revisited at another time. However, if the topic is completely unrelated to the topic being discussed say something like, 'That's a great comment. We don't have time to address that right now, but let's talk more about it after the session!'

## Inclusive group communication 2

The following are some practical tips for how facilitators can make these meetings more inclusive of people with disabilities and other community members who may have difficulties participating in the process.

## General tips

- Talk directly to people with disabilities rather than people who might be assisting them (for example, interpreters, family members)
- Ask people with disabilities how they prefer to communicate, where they prefer to sit in meetings, etc.
- Try to sit or stand so that you are talking at eye level (rather than looking down at someone)
- When communicating with a whole community or a group of people with different types of impairments, use more than one type of communication - both visual and verbal.

## Tips to include people with vision impairments

- Ask how people prefer to access written material (for example, Braille, large print, or electronic format) and provide materials in this format as much as possible
- Read out loud descriptions of written material or pictures that are used in any meeting
- In a group meeting or event, introduce yourself every time you speak (so that a person with vision impairment knows who is speaking).
- Try to make sure only one person speaks at a time in meetings
- Tell the person if you are leaving the conversation or room

## Tips to include deaf people and people who are hard of hearing

- Ask a person what type of communication is best for them - for example, sign language, lip reading, using help of a family member
- If a person uses sign language it is important to use a sign language interpreter

2  These tips are adapted from Inclusion Communication Tips developed by CBM.

1

- When there are no sign language interpreters, close family members might be able to interpret for the person
- If a person can lip read, look directly at them, make sure they can see your lips and speak clearly
- Use multiple different types of communication - pictures, writing, demonstrations, etc.
- Make sure only one person speaks at a time in meetings and encourage people to raise their hands before speaking so the person (or interpreter) can follow the conversation (particularly if they are lip reading).
- Ask people where they would like to sit so they can hear better.

## Tips to include people with intellectual disabilities

- Use clear language, simple words and avoid long sentences
- Use pictures and photos instead of lots of words
- Do not speak to adults or teenagers/youths like they are children
- Repeat information and demonstrations to help understanding
- Use hands-on (practical) activities and give examples
- Give people lots of time to understand and think about what is being said
- Remove other distractions in a room to help people focus

## Tips for including people with psycho-social disabilities

- Keep discussions calm, and do not make people feel as though you want to end a conversation or leave them out of interactions
- If a person seems like they are not interested, give them encouragement to participate
- Always treat the person with respect and ask their opinion in discussions
- Be flexible and give opportunities for people to make a choice about how they want to participate in a meeting - some people might feel worried in situations where they do not have any control

## Using inclusive energizers

During group meetings it is often helpful to use short energizers - activities which promote movement or fun that last less than 5 minutes - in between the longer activities. These short activities can help to motivate participants and keep them entertained and energetic, especially in between some of the more difficult or heavy activities. This can be

short exercises that get people moving, make them laugh, or encourage group bonding, such as songs or other activities.

When selecting your energizers, it is important to ensure that the energizers you select are inclusive of people with disabilities. In your group you may have individuals with speech or hearing impairments (for example, who require sign language interpretation) or individuals with physical impairments which limit their mobility or use of their limbs, etc.

Each group will be different. It is important that you consider the needs and abilities of the individuals in your group when choosing energizers. Tailor the energizers or activities to your group members. Do not choose activities which cannot be done by all members of the group.

## For example:

- If there are individuals with impairments that limit their mobility (such as being in a wheelchair or missing limbs such as an arm), ensure that activities do not require movements which they cannot perform. Think of how you could modify the energizer to be more inclusive.
- If there are individuals with hearing or speech impairments, ensure that you tailor the activity so that they are fully able to participate. This may require ensuring more time for interpretation of the instructions or avoiding activities that require people to be able to hear.

## ACTIVITY 1.1

## Welcome (1 hour)

Purpose: to welcome everyone to the group and create a space of trust and confidentiality where participants feel comfortable to establish the ground rules or agreements.

Note to the facilitator: Before conducting the group, it is important that you as a facilitator understand the difference between traditional teaching style, where the teacher or facilitator is above the participants, and the group education facilitation style, where the facilitator and group members are equals.

<!-- image -->

## Welcome (1 hour)

1. Welcome participants to the group as they arrive and introduce yourself.
2. Thank them for coming and record each person's name and information on the intake sheet/attendance log.
3. Ask the participants to take a seat until all the participants have arrived.
4. Once everyone has arrived (or enough time has passed), tell the group:

<!-- image -->

'Welcome and thank you for coming! We are very happy that you accepted our invitation to participate in this group meeting. The purpose of this group is to create a space for expectant and current parents of young children to meet, discuss, and learn from each other.

This program - Bandebereho - was created by RWAMREC and Promundo, and is being implemented in collaboration with the Government of Rwanda and the Ministry of Health/Rwanda Biomedical Center, and the District of Musanze.

This program in particular aims to engage men as fathers and partners in promoting maternal, newborn and child health and healthy couple relations. You were invited to this group because you are between 21 and 40 years of age and you are either expecting a child or have a young child under the age of 5 years, and you live in this community.

During our meetings, we will discuss how men and women can work together and supportive and respectful partners and parents to improve the well-being of our children and our families.'

5. After you have welcomed everyone to the session, explain that you would now like everyone to introduce themselves to the group. Ask each person to go around the circle and introduce himself and state how many children he has.
6. After each participant has introduced himself, tell the group:

<!-- image -->

'Over the next few months, we will aim to meet one time per week for a total of 16 meetings. Each session will have a different topic and will include interactive activities and group discussion. Many of the sessions are designed for men and women to participate together, but some sessions are designed specifically for men only, where we will discuss men's experiences a s husbands and fathers.'

1

7. Ask the group if they have any questions about the group sessions, or if they would like to share some of their expectations for the group sessions.
8. Allow 15 minutes for participants to share and discuss (one person at a time).
9. Thank the group for sharing their expectations. Tell the group that sharing these expectations is an important first step towards making positive changes in their lives and relationships. Through our discussion, we can develop realistic expectations of what will be accomplished during our time together. Knowing each other's desires for this group will also enable us to better help each with the problems we are facing.
10. Next, tell the group that your role as the facilitator(s) is to support the process of change, to encourage everyone to talk and share, and to guarantee that everyone feels safe and secure within the group.
11. Explain that in the next activity the group will get to know each other better and discuss some rules or agreements that can help everyone in the group feel safe and comfortable during the group meetings.

| Facilitator note   | If there are many participants, there may not be time for every person to share his expectations. Encourage different participants to share their opinions.   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Facilitator note   | To set realistic expectations, as a facilitator, you need to inform the group which of their expectations will or will not be fulfilled during the group meetings. It is likely that there will be some expectations or topics that will not be covered during the group sessions. Explain to the group that although some of their expectations or desires may not be directly discussed during the group meetings, they should use the group and its members as an opportunity to seek advice, to discuss important matters, or to learn from each other.   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Activity 1.2:

## Creating group agreements (45 minutes)

Purpose: To create a set of group agreements to help create a respectful environment where participants are comfortable to share and learn without fear of judgment, backlash, or ridicule.

1. Explain that the group will now create and agree upon a set of shared agreements that will govern the functioning of the group throughout all the sessions.
2. Tell the group that during the meetings they will discuss important issues facing them in their daily lives and will be asked to speak about their personal experiences. For this reason, it is important that everyone in the group feels comfortable to discuss and share in front of each other.
3. Ask the group, 'What rules or agreements would help you to feel safe and comfortable to discuss and share in this group?' Ask the group members to contribute ideas for agreements they would like the group to adopt for them to feel comfortable and to trust the other group members.
4. As the group shares ideas for agreements, write them down on a piece of paper in your notebook (or if available, a flipchart). After the group has finished providing ideas, read the list aloud to the group. Ask the group, 'Is there anything missing which you would like to add?'

| Facilitator note   | It is important to ensure that different members of the group are involved in sharing suggestions for the group agreements and that certain individuals do not dominate the conversation.   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Facilitator note   | In the box below is a list of several recommended rules that you can share with the group to help guide the discussion. If these rules are not mentioned first by the group members, you may emphasize them.   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

1

## Potential agreements for creating a successful group environment:

## Privacy and Confidentiality:

- The privacy of personal experiences must be secured. No one should discuss the private information shared in the group with others in the community, if someone does not want it to be shared. All personal stories and experiences that are shared in the group will remain in the group.
- However, participants are encouraged to share any knowledge or lessons they have learned in the sessions with others outside of this group, such as friends, family members and neighbors.

## Equality and Responsibility:

- All members of the group are equal, irrespective of age, gender, or background. All members have a voice and the right to speak, share and contribute.
- All members are responsible for their own actions and behavior. Every member takes responsibility for what he/she does.

## Respect and Empathy:

- Speak one at a time - allow each person the time to speak. Everyone's viewpoint is important, so we need to make sure everyone is heard. Listen and show interest in what others have to say.
- Practice empathy - Imagine yourself in the other person's position and try to understand how they feel. Respect the opinions of others and try not to judge others for their experiences or opinions.
- Every member should actively participate and contribute to the group. Use only 'I believe, I think, or I have experienced' statements - Do not assume that your viewpoint is shared with everyone else in the group.
- Commit to attend all the sessions and to be on time.
- Comply with these agreements.
5. Make any additions that are suggested. After the list is complete, ask each group member if they can agree to the list of group agreements: 'Does everyone agree to this list and commit to upholding these agreements during our meetings?'

Facilitator note

If someone does not want to commit to the agreements, ask him why. Allow the group to discuss any of the concerns that participants have about a particular agreement. Suggest that the agreement be changed or removed, depending on the desires of the group. Ask the group: 'Are there alternative agreements that you would feel more comfortable with?'

6. After everyone has committed to the group agreements, thank everyone for their input and commitment to the group agreements. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Creating group agreements will help everyone to feel comfortable, safe and respected within this group. The agreements will remain in place for the duration of the group sessions. It is everyone's responsibility to follow them and encourage others to follow them.'

## Check-out (15 minutes)

1. Explain that the session is ending and that each meeting will end with a 'check-out,' where participants will have an opportunity to reflect on what has been discussed.
2. Ask the group:

<!-- image -->

What did you think about what we discussed today?

Do you have any questions about the session? Are you looking forward to our future meetings?

3. After finishing the questions, inform the group that the next session is for men and women. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session.

| Facilitator note   | Use this opportunity to remind participants of the group agreements. For example, if one of the agreements was to be respectful, encourage everyone to listen while the others are speaking. This can include practicing empathy, by trying to imagine themselves in the other person's position and not judging their ideas or experiences.   |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Activity 2.1:

## Our attitudes about men and women (45 minutes)

Purpose: To explore participants' attitudes about men and women and their roles in the home and in society.

Optional: If you have flipchart paper, before the activity begins, tape two posters on the wall: one that says 'AGREE' and one that says 'DISAGREE', leaving enough space between each sign to allow a group of participants to stand near each one.

1. Explain to the group that you are going to do an activity that will help them to reflect on their own attitudes and beliefs about men and women. Remind the participants that everyone has a right to his or her own opinion.
2. Ask the group to stand up and move to where there is plenty of space.
3. Explain that you are going to read a series of statements. After you have read a statement, the participants should think about whether they agree or disagree with the statement. Those who agree with the statement should then move to the (facilitator's) left, and those who disagree should move to the (facilitator's) right.
4. Read aloud the first statement you have chosen.

## List of statements:

- Men can't clean the house or wash dishes.
- Men should make the final decisions in the household.
- A woman is more of a woman once she has had children.
- Women should be able to work outside the home if they choose to.
- Men should be as involved as women in caring for their children.
- A woman should be ready for sex whenever her husband wants it.
- It's a man's duty to earn money for the family.
- Someone who has paid work is more valuable to the family than someone who does the care and domestic work.
5. After the participants have moved to different sides of the room, ask for one or two participants who agree with the statement to explain why they chose 'agree' (if there are participants who agreed).

1

6. Next, ask for one or two participants who disagree with the statement to explain why they chose 'disagree' (if there are participants who disagreed).
7. After a few people from each group have given their opinions, ask if anyone wants to change their minds? If yes, ask why?
8. Read the next statement and continue the same steps until you have read all four statements and participants have had a chance to explain their opinions.
9. After you have finished the list of statements, ask the group to sit down in their chairs and ask the following questions:

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

- Which statements did you have the strongest opinions about? Why do you think this was so?
- How did it feel to talk about an opinion that was different from some of the other participants?
- How do you think these opinions and beliefs we have about men and women influence the way we interact with men and women in our daily lives?

Facilitator note

This is a good opportunity to emphasize that the Bandebereho group is a safe space where everyone should feel comfortable to share his/her opinions. Remind the group of the group agreements that were established and how important it is that the group keep these agreements.

Thank the participants for participating in this activity and for sharing their opinions and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

<!-- image -->

'Men and women receive messages from family, community and the media about how they should act and how they should relate to each other. These messages influence our attitudes and beliefs about men and women, and how we interact with each other, often without us even realizing it!'

## Activity 2.2:

## What is this thing called gender? 3 (1 hour 15 minutes)

Purpose: To discuss the difference between sex and gender, and to reflect on how gender norms - or the expectations about what it means to be a man or to be a woman influence the lives and relationships of men and women.

1. Explain to the participants that this activity will help them think about the gender roles assigned to men and women, and how society influences our ideas and expectations of being fathers and mothers.
2. Ask the participants what it means to 'be a man'. Write down the words and phrases they say on a piece of paper, or a flipchart (if available). On the paper, make two columns. One column that says 'man,' one column that says 'woman.' Explain that the responses can be positive or negative, and the participants should think of both biological aspects and social characteristics.
3. After everyone has responded, ask the group what it means to 'be a woman' (or to 'be a mother'). Write down the words and phrases mentioned by the group in the second column on your piece of paper, or a flipchart (if available). Put the responses in the column that says 'woman.' Remind the group to think of both biological and social characteristics of women.
4. After all the responses are written down, exchange the titles on the pieces of paper so that the ones titled 'man' are now 'woman,' and vice versa.
5. Read the list of characteristics for a man (now marked 'woman') aloud to the group one by one. Ask the participants if the characteristics (social and biological) they mentioned for men could also be attributed to women. After each characteristic ask the group if women ever display these characteristics?
6. Next, read the list of characteristics for a woman (now marked 'man') aloud to the group one by one. Ask the group whether the characteristics mentioned for women could also be attributed to men. After each characteristic ask the group if men ever display these characteristics?
7. Explain to the group that the BIOLOGICAL characteristics of women that cannot be given to men, and vice versa, are what constitute our 'sex'. Sex is biological - we are born with male or female reproductive organs and hormones.

| Facilitator note   | A small number of individuals (called 'intersex') are born with both male and female reproductive organs or biological characteristics).   |

8. Next, explain that the SOCIAL characteristics of women (mothers) - the roles and characteristics we usually equate with women, but can be done by both women and men, constitute our 'gender'. Gender is how we are socialized - that is, how our attitudes, behavior and expectations are formed based on what society associates with being a woman or being a man. We are not born with these characteristics but learn them as we grow up.
9. Tell the group that is it very easy to confuse gender with sex. Explain that gender is constructed by our society. The society assigns certain attitudes and behaviors to individuals based on their sex (for example, that women care for children, men care for cattle) and that every individual is influenced by these social expectations. These social expectations based on sex do not remain the same but change over time.
10. Now, open the discussion using the questions below. Help the group discuss about which characteristics the participants do not think can be attributed to both men and women, and why. However, make sure that these sex and gender categories are not presented as rigid, inflexible, or unchanging.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

Where do we learn the characteristics we associate with 'being a man' or 'being a woman'?

How do our families and friends influence our ideas of how women and men should look and should act?

Do you think that expectations for how men and women should look and act are different today than when your parents and grandparents were growing up? How? Why?

Do these gender roles influence the way that boys and girls are raised?

Is it hard to live up to these expectations of being a man? Being a woman?

How do these different expectations of how women and men should act influence our relationships with our partners?

How do these different expectations of how women and men should act influence our roles as parents and how we interact with our children?

What did you learn with this activity? Is there anything that you learned that you could apply to your own lives or relationships?

Thank the participants for participating in this activity and for sharing their opinions and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

Closing Message

'Although there are biological differences between men and women, many of the differences we attribute to men and women are constructed by our society. These differences are not part of our biology - we are not born this way - but we learn that these are the ways we are expected to behave.  We learn these characteristics from family members, friends, cultural and religious institutions, and at school.'

## Check-out (15 minutes)

1. Explain that the session is ending and that each meeting will end with a 'check-out,' where participants will have an opportunity to reflect on what has been discussed.
2. Ask the group:

SESSION 3

## Activity 3.1:

## My concerns as a father (1 hour)

Purpose: To help participants reflect on their needs and interests as fathers - whether they are about to become or already are fathers - and to share their experiences.

1. Explain to the participants that this activity will help them to reflect on their experiences of becoming or being fathers - including what motivates them, and any concerns or anxieties they have about becoming or being fathers. [Some men will be becoming fathers for the first time, for others, it will be their second or third child. Encourage men to share the different worries that they have.]
2. Ask the participants to pair up with the person sitting next to them and discuss some of the things that excite them about being or becoming a father. They will have 10 minutes to discuss:
- What excites them the most about being or becoming a father?
- What makes them the happiest about being or becoming a father?
3. Next, ask the participants to continue discussing in their pairs. This time they will discuss some of the anxieties about becoming or being a father. They will have 10 minutes to discuss:
- What scares them about being or becoming a father?
- What makes them nervous or gives them stress or anxiety?
- Is there something they feel they need more information about?
4. After 10 minutes, ask if anyone would like to share some of their worries or anxieties with the larger group.
5. As the participants are sharing their worries, ask if any of the other participants have any advice or experiences to share. You can ask the group, 'Who would like to share their experience on how they were able to resolve this issue?' or 'What do people think about this comment?'
6. After everyone has shared his experiences or answered questions from the group, open the discussion using the questions below.

1

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

- How did it feel to hear about the concerns and experiences of your peers?
- Have you ever spoken to anyone else about the worries or concerns that you have as a father? With whom did you share them?
- Why do men talk so little about their concerns about fatherhood?
- How can we make it easier for men to discuss about being father and receive information?
- Are any of the worries or anxieties that you have about fatherhood influenced by societal expectations or what it means to 'be a man'?
- Are there things you would like to do as a father but haven't because you feel you would be judged?
- What do you think can be done to support men to be the fathers they want to be?

Thank the participants for sharing their ideas and experiences. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Expecting a child and becoming a father can be a particularly stressful time for a man. Even if you are not a new or expectant father, being a parent can be stressful and challenging. Sharing your worries and concerns with other men - and with your partner - can help to alleviate some of this stress and find solutions when needed.'

<!-- image -->

## What are the benefits of being an involved father? (1 hour)

Purpose: To help men reflect on the benefits of being an involved father, including benefits for the child, the mother, and the man himself.

1. Explain that in this activity the group is going to discuss more about the benefits of men being involved fathers and how it can benefit the mother, the child, and men themselves.
2. Ask the group, 'What does it mean to be an 'involved father'? What are the characteristics of an 'involved father'?'
3. After the group has shared their ideas, explain that being an involved father can start from the very beginning, when their partner is pregnant.
4. Ask the group: 'What are the benefits of a man being an involved father - meaning that he is present and actively involved in the life of his child beginning from the prenatal period throughout the child's life?'
- What are the benefits for the child?
- What are the benefits for the mother of the child?
- What are the benefits for the father himself?
- When does being an involved father start? (For example, at birth, before birth, etc.) Why?
5. After the group discussion, tell the group that an involved father can participate in antenatal visits, support his partner through her pregnancy, and be present during the birth of his child. Doing these things enables a father to promote the health of his partner and the child and allows him to build strong bonds with his child and his partner.
6. Next, read the information on the benefits of involved fatherhood from the box on the next page aloud to the group:

1

## The Benefits of Being an Involved Father 4

Research shows that when fathers are involved and present during the prenatal period and during birth, there are many benefits for the mother, child, and the father!

## Benefits for the mother:

- Involved fathers contribute to reducing maternal stress during pregnancy.
- Mothers who are accompanied during antenatal visits usually attend more of them, compared to mothers who are not accompanied.
- When the fathers are present in the delivery room to help the mother, mothers have a more positive experience and feel less pain during childbirth than when they are alone.

## Benefits for the child:

- Infants with involved fathers have better cognitive (learning) functions.
- Infants with involved fathers more frequently develop into children with high self-esteem who can resolve conflicts without violence.
- Children with involved fathers generally have fewer behavioral problems.

## Benefits for the father:

- Fathers involved in their children's lives are more satisfied and more likely to stay involved.
- Involved fathers have better health: they take fewer drugs, consume less alcohol, live longer, and feel mentally and physically healthier.
- Some studies show that fathers involved in caregiving have more satisfying relationships with their partners, feel more connected to their families and report better sex lives with their partner.

4  Adapted from the Program P Manual (Promundo , REDMAS, EME, 2013).

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

- What do you think about the benefits of being an involved father that were mentioned?
- Did anything surprise you? Why?
- Have you experienced any of these benefits yourself? Or seen an involved father who received any of these benefits?
- How can a man be an involved father?
- What are the biggest challenges to being an involved father?
- Is it hard for men to be more involved in their children's lives? Why or why not?
- How does being a good partner support a man to be a good father?
- What could be done to make it easier for a man to support his partner during pregnancy, childbirth and in the raising of children?
- Have you learned anything in this activity that you will use in your own life?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

<!-- image -->

'Being an involved father begins during pregnancy! When men are actively involved in their child's life it has positive benefits for the man, the woman, and the child. It's never too late (or early) to be an involved father and supportive partner!'

## Check-out (15 minutes)

1. Explain that the session is ending and that it is time for the 'check-out,' where participants will have an opportunity to reflect on what has been discussed.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session?
3. After finishing the questions, explain to the group that at the end of most of the sessions a 'homework assignment' is going to be assigned. Each person or couple will be asked to go home and discuss a particular topic or do a particular task. The homework assignments are designed to support members of the group to reflect on and build on the group sessions.
4. Assign this week's homework assignment:

Homework: Explain to the participants that when they go home, they should speak with their partner and share any concerns or fears they have about becoming or being a father. They should invite their partner to share her own concerns about becoming or being a mother. Ask your partner what she expects of you as a father. Listen to her. Come prepared to share voluntarily in the next session your experiences about the conversation.

5. Thank everyone for coming and inform the group that the next session is for men and their partners. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session.

## Ensuring a healthy pregnancy (2 hours)

Purpose: To inform expectant fathers and mothers about the biological process of pregnancy, including what men can do to ensure the health of the mother and fetus during and after birth, and to address many of their concerns about the experience of pregnancy.

Before the session you should have identified an animatrice/animateur de santé maternelle to come to the group. The ASM should come prepared to the session to share information about the nine months of pregnancy, including:

The most important biological and hormonal changes for the mother and baby during these nine months.

- The importance of antenatal visits for pregnant women and their partners.
- The new guidelines recommending eight (8) antenatal contacts and the ANC schedule for the new model of eight (8) contacts. 5
- How the father can support the health of the mother during and immediately after pregnancy. This should include warning signs and symptoms to look for prior to and immediately after giving birth and what should be done to ensure the health of the mother during and after pregnancy.
- Information about fistula.
- Sexual relations and pregnancy: this should include a discussion of safe sexual practices during pregnancy, including a discussion of cultural norms and addressing any myths they have about sex during pregnancy. The discussion should also focus on harmful practices regarding sex immediately after birth.
- The consequences of drinking alcohol on the pregnant woman and the child.
- Hygiene for couples during and after pregnancy (avoiding urinary infections, etc.)
- The nutritional needs of pregnant women: to eat a healthy and balanced diet; have plenty of clean, safe drinks (boiled water, soups, herbal tea); eat iodized salt: women who lack iodine when they become pregnant are at greater risk of having a baby who has physical or mental impairments.)

The importance of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months, the risks of giving formula or other breast-milk substitutes, and the fact that breastfeeding continues to be important after 6 months - up to 24 months.

- The importance of starting to give other foods at 6 months of age and gradually

5  National Antenatal Care Guideline, MOH/WHO, October 2019

introducing a variety of foods from 6 months to one year.

- The prevention of intimate partner violence for pregnant women.

NOTE: The Kinyarwanda version of this manual includes detailed information drawn from the existing manual used by the ASM.

The ASM should allow enough time for participants to ask questions and to clarify any concerns that they have. This should take up to a maximum of 2 hours. If there are individuals who still have questions after 2 hours, encourage them to speak to the ASM after the meeting or on another day.

After the ASM has finished leading the discussion, thank her/him for providing her/his time for the group.

| Facilitator note   | After presenting the information, the ASM is free to leave the group. However, if she/he prefers to stay for the remain of the session she/he can do so (if the participants agree).   |

## How can I support my partner during pregnancy? 6  (45 minutes)

Purpose: To help participants identify the specific ways that men can provide support to their partners during pregnancy.

1. Explain to the participants that they are going to do a short activity to help them understand how men can support their partners to have a happy and healthy pregnancy.
2. Ask volunteers from the group to role play two different couples. Two women are expecting children, but one woman has an involved and supportive husband/ partner, and the other woman has an uninvolved and unsupportive husband/partner. The objective of the two role plays is to help participants to understand the positive and negative consequences of men's roles and responsibilities for ensuring a healthy pregnancy.
3. After the role plays, ask the group, 'What are some of the things that women can do to ensure a healthy pregnancy, including the health of the fetus?' Allow the group to share as many responses as possible.
4. Explain that, during pregnancy, a woman has many responsibilities: some that biologically only she can do, and others that are socially assigned to her because of her gender.
5. Explain that during pregnancy, the mother must live an environment with healthy physical, environmental, nutritional, emotional, and social conditions. For the optimal development of the fetus during pregnancy, the mother must feel relaxed, at ease and supported and she must live in an environment that is free from violence.

| Facilitator note   | As the participants provide answers to the question, you can write them down in your notebook under the word'Woman'. Alternatively, if you have a flipchart or chalkboard available, you can make two columns - label the first column'Woman'and the other column'Man.'Write the responses of the group in the appropriate column. If the group has challenges in identifying possible activities, there is a box with a list of possible responses on the next page.   |

## Some things women can do to have a healthy pregnancy:

- Attend antenatal consultations.
- Live in a home free from physical or psychological violence.
- Eat healthy and nutritious foods.
- Abstain from drinking alcohol.
- Get plenty of rest.
- Drink plenty of water.
- Do not smoke cigarettes.
- Do light exercise.
- Avoid heavy lifting.
- Stay away from others who may have a cold or other infectious sickness.
- Get the required vaccinations.
- Sleep under a mosquito net.
- Avoid excessive stress.
- Prepare for the birth of the child.
- Make contact with your baby in some way every day in a private, peaceful and quiet place (be consistent).
- Get comfortable and relax - 'focus only on your baby for at least 15 minutes twice a day or 30 minutes in one go.
- Play music, simply talk to her baby, or read the baby a story while she massages her belly and make this a habit and continue to do this throughout pregnancy, especially after the sixth month.
- Consider allowing the father to experiment with different ways of massaging her belly, as his touch will make her feel loved and special and these feelings will pass on to the baby who will feel the same.
6. Now that you have a list, ask the participants what role men can play to help support their pregnant partner in each of these tasks ('what can men to do ensure a healthy pregnancy for their partner and their future child?') For each thing that was listed for a woman/mother to ensure a healthy pregnancy, there should be one way that the man/father can support her.
7. For example, if the group said that a mother should attend antenatal consultations, you must ask the group, 'what can the father do to support his partner in attending

ANC?' Or, if it was suggested that a woman must eat healthy and nutritious foods, ask the group, 'what can a man do to ensure his partner has healthy and nutritious food?' Continue in this manner.

| Facilitator note   | Go through the list you've written in your notebook and ask the group to come up with one thing a man can do to support his partner during pregnancy for every item on the women's list. Write the'men's'responses in the column'man'in your notebook or on a flipchart (if available). In case the group has trouble coming up with responses, some examples are found in the box on the next page.   |

8. Compare the two lists and open the discussion using the questions below.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

What makes an impression on you when you listen to the lists of activities for women and for men?

In your community, do men take responsibility in providing support for their partners during pregnancy and share in the tasks listed? Why or why not?

Why do men not involve themselves more during pregnancy? What are the barriers to this?

How can conflict within couples, such as physical violence, impact the health of the mother and the child?

What effects would it have on a pregnant woman if her partner took more responsibility in taking care of domestic chores and caring for children?

What impact would it have on the man?

Based on the list, what are some things men in this group can do now to provide support for their pregnant partner? (Some examples include cooking meals, providing emotional support, taking children to school, cleaning, going to antenatal care visits).

## Facilitator note

Be aware that not all members of the group are currently expecting a child. For those that are not expecting a child, encourage them to think about what they might do differently during the next pregnancy.

If time allows, ask volunteers to role-play an ideal situation of a supportive partner during pregnancy, based on the ideas shared during the session.

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

'There are many ways that men can support their partners to have a healthy and happy pregnancy. This can include attending antenatal visits, doing work around the home, and providing emotional support to your partner. When men support their partners in this way it can also help to make couples' relationships stronger.'

## Closing Message

## Activity 5.2:

## Attending antenatal care (1 hour 15 minutes)

Purpose: To help men and their partners understand the importance of antenatal care and of men accompanying their pregnant partners to antenatal care visits.

1. Explain to the group that you are going to do an activity to reflect on why men should support and accompany their pregnant partners in attending antenatal care.
2. Before beginning the activity, describe to the group what happens during the antenatal care visits.

## Antenatal Care:

The first ANC visit, which most men are familiar with, is an opportunity to provide expectant parents with information on what to expect during pregnancy, to do HIV testing and refer those who need it to PMTCT (prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV services).

The other visits help the pregnant woman and her partner to prepare for the delivery process, to provide information on adequate nutrition for the mother, explain the signs and symptoms to recognize in case of illness or emergency, give vaccinations, and discuss family planning and contraceptive use to plan for future pregnancies.

The ANC visits give very important information to help protect the health of the mother and fetus, which is important for a woman's partner to know. It is important for men to accompany their wives/ partners to these visits to be able to effectively support their wives/ partners during pregnancy and birth.

3. Explain to the group that you are now going to do role-plays to reflect on the reasons why men should attend as many ANC visits as they can with their wives/partners. Divide the participants into two small groups. Assign each group a role-play to develop. Explain that not all participants have to act in the role-play, but they should participate in the development of the role-play.
- a.   Group 1: A pregnant woman is at home with her husband when she develops a bleeding problem. Her husband never attended an ANC visit with her and does not know what to do. After delaying for a long time, a neighbor comes by and tells the husband to take his wife to the health facility. By the time they

reach the health facility, the woman is very weak and cannot answer the nurse's questions. The nurse asks the man how many months pregnant his wife is and her health status. The man does not know.

- b.   Group 2: A pregnant woman is at home with her husband when she develops a bleeding problem. The husband remembers from the ANC visit that this is a symptom of a serious problem and decides to take her to the hospital. When they reach the hospital, the woman is now very weak and cannot answer the nurse's questions. The nurse asks the husband about the woman's health and her pregnancy. He can answer all her questions because he remembers their discussion with the health provider during their antenatal visits.
4. Give the groups 10 minutes to prepare their role-plays. After 10 minutes, ask each group to present their role-play. Once the role-plays are completed, open the discussion using the questions below.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

What did you notice in the role-plays? Are these situations realistic?

Do any of you know someone who has experienced a similar situation?

What are the benefits of men attending more than one ANC visit? For themselves? For their partners?

What information can men learn that will help them support their partner to ensure a healthy pregnancy?

Are there other risks that are involved when men are not informed about their partner's pregnancy and her health?

How many ANC visits have you attended already?

For the women - How many visits do you plan to attend?

For the men - How many visits do you plan to attend?

What are some of the reasons that women do not attend the recommended ANC visits?

Are there ways that men can support their partners to attend these visits?

What can you do to encourage other men to attend ANC visits with their partners?

What did you learn in this activity? Will it be useful to you in your own life?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Antenatal care (ANC) visits are critical for monitoring the health of the mother and development of the fetus. Women are recommended to access ANC 8 times during pregnancy. There are many benefits for women and men when men accompany their partners to these visits. For example, it can help both partners to prepare for the birth of their child and bring them closer together.'

## Check-out (15 minutes)

1. Explain that the session is ending and that it is time for the 'check-out.'
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session?
3. After finishing the questions, assign this week's homework assignment:

Homework: For the men: If your partner is currently pregnant, try to do one thing to support her that we discussed, such as cooking meals, providing emotional support, taking the children to school, cleaning, or going to antenatal care visits. If your partner is not pregnant, are there other things that you can do to show her you care? Before you do the activity, inform your partner of what you want to do and why, and find out from her the type of support that she prefers. Be prepared to come to the next session to talk about this experience.

4. Thank everyone for coming and inform the group that the next session is for men and women. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session.

## Providing comfort and care during labor 7 (45 minutes)

Purpose: To discuss how men can provide comfort and care during labor, including pain alleviation techniques for women which men can also participate in.

1. Explain that the group is now going to discuss more in detail the ways that men can provide comfort and care to their partners, including during labor.
2. Remind the group about the activity from the last session, on the benefits of being an involved father. Research from some settings indicates that when a man is present during childbirth, the woman often is calmer and feels less pain during the delivery.
3. Ask the group:
- Ask the women - What are some of the anxieties you have about giving birth?
- Ask the men - What are some of the anxieties you have about your partner giving birth?
- Do you think there are things that men can do to provide comfort and care to women during labor or birth?
4. Explain to the group that the period of labor can be a stressful, as well as painful time for women. Tell the group that you are going to share with them a technique that can help women to deal with pain during contractions - a technique that men can support their partners to use.
5. Share with the group the pain alleviation technique in the box below. Read through it and practice some of the tips.

For the pregnant woman: maintain a breathing rhythm and complete a cycle every four seconds.

- Breathe in through your nose in the first second.
- Exhale through your mouth in short intervals while counting two three and four seconds.
- Exhale for a longer period during the fourth second.
- Repeat.

## At the same time, the father must:

- Breathe with your partner.
- Make sure your partner is softly exhaling in your face.
- Help her relax between contractions.

The father should watch his partner and hold her hands while she breathes in through her nose and out through her mouth.

7 Adapted from the activity 'Delivery Room Role Play' from the Program P Manual (Promundo, REDMAS, EME, 2013).

6. After demonstrating the technique and practicing it as a group, ask for two volunteers to role play the labor using the pain alleviation technique: one person will be the mother and person will be the father.
7. After the role play, ask if any other volunteers would like to try? After any other demonstrations, open the discussion using the questions below.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

What do you think about this pain alleviation technique?

- Will any of you try this in the future?
- In addition to supporting their partners during the labor and the delivery, what can men do to help support their partners to prepare in the days before giving birth?
- What are the benefits of being present at the delivery of your child?
- For the mother? [For example, she may feel more in control and supported if her male partner is there to share the experience].
- For the father? [For example, this is a crucial opportunity to build the emotional and physical bond with your child.]
- If a father happens not to be present, what can he do to still be supportive to his partner? [For example, he can help with housework and be present in the waiting room.]
- What can men do immediately after the birth to make the mother comfortable and ensure the health of mother and baby?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Labor is an important part of the process of childbirth, which can be quite painful for women. However, there are ways that men can support their partners to feel comfortable and calm during this time. In the weeks before a child is due, partners can discuss how the woman if and how a woman would like her partner to be present, and practice some of the techniques that we've discussed.'

## In the maternity ward 8  (45 minutes)

Purpose: To share ideas and experiences about the role of the father during labor and childbirth and to prepare men to support their partners during this significant time.

1. Explain that the purpose of the first activity is to role-play what it is like in the maternity ward when a woman is giving birth and to think about the ways that men can support their partners during childbirth.
2. Ask the group:
- What do men usually do when their partner is in labor? During childbirth?
- Are men ever present in the maternity ward during labor or childbirth?
- What happens if the woman is uncomfortable with her husband/partner being present during labor? During delivery? Why might that be?
- What happens if a man is uncomfortable being present during labor? During delivery? Why might that be?
- Do partners usually discuss whether a woman would like her partner present during labor or delivery? Why or why not?
3. After the group has responded, ask for three people to volunteer from the group. If this activity is being done in a mixed group of men and women, ask for at least one female volunteer.
4. Assign each of the volunteers a role - one person should be the mother giving birth, one should be the father, and one should be a doctor, nurse, or midwife.
5. Explain that they will be role-playing the birth of a child in the maternity ward. Emphasize to the participants that they are now actors and not themselves. Tell them to imagine that it is 18:00 in the evening. The woman is in the delivery room and in some pain because she is about to give birth. The doctor and midwife are preparing to deliver the baby. The father is also present. Give the volunteers five minutes to act out the scene.
6. After five minutes ask the participants to return to the circle. Ask everyone to 'step out' of his or her role and open the discussion using the questions below.

| Facilitator note   | This activity is best done with the expectant partner as it loosely simulates the birthing process. It may induce bouts of laughter and feelings of silliness, which are completely normal!   |

## Skin-to-skin contact with your newborn (30 minutes)

Purpose: To share with the group the benefits of skin-to-skin contact for newborns, and how it can be done by both mothers and fathers!

1. Explain to the group that they will now discuss ways that both mothers and fathers can care for and bond with their newborn baby directly after birth.
2. Tell the group that directly after birth, providing newborns with direct skin-to-skin contact is essential for their health and well-being, and both mothers and fathers can do it! Share with the group the information on skin-to-skin contact from the box below.

## Skin-to-Skin Contact with Your Baby:

- Once the baby is born, it is important to have skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Providing newborns with direct skin-to-skin contact is essential for the health and well-being of the child, and it can be done by both mothers and fathers!
- Skin-to-skin contact is when the mother's or father's skin touches the baby's skin - this can be done through hugging, placing the baby on your bare chest, etc. Babies love skin-to-skin contact!
- Research shows that after birth, skin-to-skin contact between the mother and her baby immediately reduces infant crying, improves mother-infant interaction, keeps the baby warm, and helps the mother to breastfeed successfully (World Health Organization).
- Although fathers cannot breastfeed, they still can play an important role in providing skin-to-skin contact. For example, babies born by caesarean section need to have contact with a significant caregiver but sometimes the mother is not in a condition to immediately provide that care. This is where fathers can play an important role in regulating the newborn's body temperature and in cardiorespiratory stabilization. This kind of physical closeness helps promote the emotional bond between father and child.
- Fathers can talk, sit, sing, rock, tell stories to, burp or bathe the baby. Make some time in the day just for you and your baby - babies need cuddling and hugs from their fathers too.
3. Once you have shared the information on skin-to-skin contact, open the discussion using the Group Discussion Questions.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

- Did you learn anything valuable in this activity?
- Ask the women - Have any of you done skin-to-skin contact with your newborns? What was it like?
- Ask the men - Have any of you done skin-to-skin contact with your newborns? What was it like?
- How many of you plan to try skin-to-skin contact with your future baby?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Skin-to-skin contact with your newborn is an important way to care for and bond with your newborn baby. Research also shows that it can help babies (especially premature ones) to thrive. It can be an especially useful way for fathers to bond with their child and provide much needed care, particularly if the mother needs to rest.'

## Check-out (15 minutes)

1. Explain that the session is ending and that it is time for the 'check-out.'
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session?
3. After finishing the questions, assign this week's homework assignment:

Homework: Ask participants to go home and continue reflecting on today's session and practicing the techniques that were shared. Visit the health center and find out all the necessary information needed to prepare for the birth of your child. Come back to the next session ready to share your experience.

| Facilitator note   | It is important to be aware that men may feel a bit uncomfortable practicing with a doll at first. Emphasize the importance of practicing these skills with the doll - where you can afford to make mistakes! It will help them be prepared for when their baby arrives.   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## How to Hold a Baby:

Always hold the baby's back and head when carrying him or her. The baby's neck is not able to hold up the head on its own for approximately the first three months.

With one hand, hold the baby's back and with your other hand support the baby's head so that it doesn't wobble.

Once you the baby in your hands, support the baby's whole body in one of your arms, placing its head on the crease of your forearm while you support below the back with the other hand. When you have acquired enough practice, you can hold the baby with one arm.

3. Now, tell the participants to practice how to hold and carry the baby properly using the dolls using the instructions below. Demonstrate using the baby doll. You can also ask any experienced fathers in the group to demonstrate.
4. Divide the participants into two groups. Give each group a baby doll and tell them to practice holding the baby. Give the groups five minutes to practice.

5. After five minutes, ask everyone to come back to the group. Explain that you are they are now going to discuss how to care for a baby in ways like bathing and keeping them clean or changing their diapers.
6. Ask the group whether anyone knows how to change and clean a baby after he or she has soiled the diaper or clothes? Allow the participants to share any experience they have in changing or cleaning a baby.
7. Ask if anyone can demonstrate using the baby doll?
8. Next, share the useful information on how to change a baby, from the box below. Ask if anyone would like to volunteer to demonstrate. Allow a few minutes for demonstration and then open the discussion using the questions below.

## How to change a baby:

1. Wash your hands first and make sure they are clean.
2. Get any materials you need such as a cloth or towel and a new diaper or clothes for the child.
3. Place the child on a flat, safe surface. Maintain physical contact with the child and make sure that he or she is secure. Do not leave the child unattended.
4. Remove the dirty clothes or diaper. Use a wet cloth or towel to clean the child. It is important to clean the child from front to back. Once you have wiped the child, do not use the same cloth to wipe the child - it can spread bacteria and cause the child to become ill. Use a clean towel or cloth each time you wipe.
5. Throw away or put aside any dirty items so they can be washed.
6. Wash your hands again and use soap if possible.
7. Place a clean diaper or cloth on the child and then dress him or her.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

Do you think these are things that men can do? Why or why not?

Why don't fathers participate more in taking care of young children, particularly babies?

How does having a new child in the family affect the relationship between you and your partner? (For example, babies cry all the time and need constant attention, and parents become very tired.)

Imagine this: It is 2 o'clock in the morning (am). Your child is crying, and you are not sure why. The mother of the child is exhausted because she has been up breastfeeding the child all day and night. You must get up in a few hours to go to work. As a father, what can you do?

Who has more difficulty providing care for a baby? The mother or the father? Why?

Can one get angry with the baby? Does your level of emotion differ if your baby is a boy versus a girl? Why or why not?

Can one get angry with the mother?

What do you do if you get angry? What are the options?

What are one or two things you can do to be more involved in caregiving of your newborn baby? How will this affect the mother? What are 1-2 things you can do together with the baby?

How can men support each other in their caring roles as fathers?

What are some ways that we can be responsive to the needs of our young children?

Did anyone learn anything new?  Do you think will use any of these tips?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'New babies require a lot of care! There are many things that fathers can do to care for their new child, such as holding, bathing, singing, and talking to the baby. Interaction and communication are important ways that babies learn, and they allow fathers to bond.'

## Activity 7.2:

## The importance of breastfeeding (30 minutes)

Purpose: To reflect on the importance of breastfeeding for a new baby and how men can support their partners in breastfeeding.

1. Explain that in this activity, they are going to discuss what they know about breastfeeding and how men can support their partners in breastfeeding their new child.
2. Ask the group what they know about breastfeeding:
- How long should a woman breastfeed?
- Why is it important to breastfeed?
- Did your partner/wife breastfeed after your other children were born?
- How many of you have partners/wives that are currently breastfeeding a child?
- Did your partner/wife have any challenges in breastfeeding?
3. Allow the men to share their own ideas and experiences.
4. Explain to the group that breastfeeding is very important for a new child.
- The Government and the health professionals recommend that a woman breastfeed exclusively (meaning that she does not give any other type of food or formula) for the first six months, unless she is instructed by her doctor to do otherwise.
- Breastfeeding allows a mother to pass on vital nutrients to help the child grow and become strong and healthy. The breast milk also helps protect the child from common illnesses by building up his or her immune system.
5. Tell the group that you are now going to divide them into two groups. Each group is going to create a role play to demonstrate different ways that they think men can do to help support their partners in breastfeeding. Give the groups time to prepare their role plays.
6. Once the groups are ready, ask each group to present their role play. After the roleplays are finished, ask the group:

<!-- image -->

7. Next, share with the group the information on the role that fathers can play in breastfeeding from the box on the following page.

## Fathers Can Play an Important Role in Breastfeeding 10

Breast milk is healthiest for Babies! A mother's early milk, called colostrum, is expressed from the beginning and is the only food that a baby needs. Colostrum's special role is to help your newborn stay healthy. It is filled with important vitamins, minerals, proteins, and immunities. If possible, do not give your baby water or formula in the first six months. Feeding the baby anything other than breast milk interferes with a mother's ability to produce enough milk.

- Breast milk is easier to digest than formula. Breastfed babies have less diarrhea, constipation, and colic than babies who are not breastfed.
- Breast milk contains antibodies to fight infections.
- Babies may have less risk of becoming obese, having diabetes, and developing other diseases.
- Breastfed babies have a lower risk of asthma, allergies, and certain cancers.
- Breast milk contains special ingredients to promote brain growth.

What can a Father Do? Supporting the health of your family is a great responsibility: you want to make healthy choices. This is why you, the father, should encourage your partner to breastfeed. There are many other ways you can help your partner care for your baby, including the following:

- Help with the housework and cooking and limit the number of visitors. New mothers need plenty of rest!
- You can bond with the baby too! Bathe, change and dress your baby. Sing and talk to your baby. Babies love skin-to-skin contact with their fathers! Make some time in the day just for you and your baby - babies need cuddling and hugs from their fathers too.
- Take the baby to the mother when he or she is ready to feed. If you see the baby searching for mother's breast, sucking his fist, or making sucking noises, take him or her to mother for a feeding. The baby will need to feed often, every 1 to 3 hours and will wake up to feed. Look at your baby's tiny fist and remember that it is about the same size as his/her stomach!

## Let your partner know how good a job she is doing breastfeeding!

Breastfeeding is a loving commitment. It takes time for a mother to learn how to breastfeed. If your partner is uncomfortable or experiences pain while breastfeeding, it may be because the baby is not latching on correctly or because the breast is engorged with milk. Many new mothers need help in the beginning.

8. After sharing the information from the box, ask the group: What do you think about the information that was shared? How many of you will implement some of these ideas once your baby is born, or with your current children?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Breastfeeding is an important way for new babies to get the nutrients they need to grow strong and healthy. Although men cannot breastfeed, there are many ways that men can support their partners while breastfeeding.'

## Check-out (15 minutes)

1. Explain that the session is ending and that it is time for the 'check-out.'

## The needs of children 11 (1 hour)

Purpose: To reflect on the importance of communication, interaction and affection between parents and their sons and daughters.

1. Explain to the participants that the activity will help them to reflect on the needs of children from birth until age 5 and the ways that they as parents can provide for those needs.
2. Explain to the group that as children grow, they develop both physically and mentally, and that children have different needs at different stages of their development. Tell the group that you are now going to share information on a child's developmental needs for ages 0 to 5.
3. If available, you can pass out copies of the Stages of Child Development Support Sheet to the participants.

If printed support sheets are not available: Read aloud the support sheet on the following page with the group, then proceed to step 6.

If printed support sheets are available, follow steps 4 &amp; 5 below.

4. Tell the participants that they are going to break into small groups and each group should look over the different stages of child development and think about what they, as parents, can do to provide for the different needs of children.
5. Break the participants into four groups (between 3-5 people per group) and give them 15 minutes to discuss in their small groups.
6. After 15 minutes, open a group discussion using the questions below: Ask the participants to share some of the ways they believe parents can help support the needs of children as listed on the Stages of Child Development support sheet.

| 0-6 months    | A child is easily frightened and needs to feel safe and protected. A child cannot understand rules or explanations yet. A child needs unconditional love and affection.                                                                                                         | A child will cry when he/she needs you to know something. They do not yet know any words. Crying a lot is normal. Sometimes a child does not even know why he/she is crying. A child loves to put things in their mouth. It is the way he/she explores the world. |
| 6-12 months   | A child begins to speak sounds like'ba'or'ma.' A child needs to know that you are close by. This is how he/she learns to trust in you. A child is beginning to get teeth. This causes a lot of pain, so a child may cry a lot.                                                  | A child likes it when you speak sounds back to him or her. It encourages them to communicate with you. A child will cry less and smile more. Sometimes a child will cry at the same time every day. This is how the child's brain is 'organizing'itself.          |
| 1-2 years     | A child is now an explorer! He or she will begin to talk and walk. A child likes his or her independence but needs to be able to explore in a safe environment. A child does not understand that you are trying to keep him or her safe when you tell them not to do something. | A child wants to touch and see everything. A child learns the word 'no'and understands that it is a way you tell him or her how you feel. A child has tantrums because of his/ her frustration builds and he/she cannot communicate in words how they feel.       |

| 2-3 years   | A child is beginning to understand his or her own feelings. Suddenly a child may become afraid of things, like the dark. This is because he or she now understands danger. A child may suddenly become shy around people he/she does not know. This shows that the child understands the difference between people he/she knows and strangers.   | If you must leave the room, a child may cry because he/she does not know if you will come back. If you ask a child to say'hello'to someone that he/she does not know, the child may refuse because he/ she does not know that this person is trying to be friendly.   |

| 3-5 years   | A child wants to learn everything! This might cause him/her to get into danger, so it is important to give him/her rules. Playing is an essential part of how a child's brain develops. It is how a child learns to see other people's point of view and develop empathy.                                                                        | A child will ask a lot of questions. One of their favorite words will be,'why?' A child loves to play imaginary games. A child wants to help you do your daily talks so he/she can learn important life skills.                                                       |

7. After the participants have discussed their ideas, you can share with them some of the ideas below that have not yet been discussed:

## Both parents can support the development needs of their children by: 13

- Provide interaction: Spending time looking at their (small) children, responding to their child's glances and answering their questions. This can be done while playing with the child, bathing, or changing the child, while eating with the child, teaching the child something, etc.
- Provide affection: Hold your child and give them hugs to keep them happy and calm.
- Provide stable relationships: Let your child know that you are always there for them and come when they call you.
- Provide safety and a healthy environment: Protect your child by keeping his or her environment safe from danger.
- Build your child's self-esteem: Encourage your child when he or she tries new things, applaud, and support him or her.
- Communicate with your child: Talk to your child - even if you think he or she can't doesn't understand.
- Play with your child: Children learn a lot by playing and by singing, dancing, or listening to music. They also enjoy listening to you telling them stories, it helps them learn about the world.
- Promote your child's health and development: Take him/her to the health center when necessary, for example for vaccinations or when he/ she is sick. Bring your child to an ECD center or day care.

These needs are important not only in the first years of life but can be applied throughout your child's life! Simply adapt them as your child ages.

8. After you have shared the information above, open the discussion using the questions below.

13 Adapted from Brazelton, TB and Greenspan, SI. (2000) The Irreducible Needs of Children. Cambridge: Perseus Publishing.

1

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

How do parents gendered attitudes and behaviors affect how they interact with and care for their children?

Do men and women generally discuss how they want to raise their children?

How do parents' communication styles affect their children?

How does the relationship between the parents affect their children?

How could men and women better share responsibilities for their children's needs?

What impact might this have on their children? On themselves?

Facilitator note

<!-- image -->

For example, if parents shared more equally the responsibility for children's needs, more of a child's needs might be met. A child can have two supportive, loving and involved caregivers who provide them with interaction and care. Men can experience loving bonds with their children and the benefits this brings. Women can also benefit by not being faced with the burden of being solely responsible for meeting their children's needs. Co-parenting can also strengthen the couples' relationship.

As parents, do we ever share our appreciation for our partners as parents? Why or why not? Did you learn something new in this activity?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Children grow and develop quickly in the first few years of life. It is important for parents to understand the different needs of children at different ages and to have realistic expectations of how their children should act and behave. It's also helpful if parents discuss together about how they want to raise their children and have a common understanding. Both men and women can play an integral role in meeting the needs of their children.'

## Activity 8.2:

## Positive parenting skills 14  (1 hour 30 minutes)

Purpose: To make connections between the long-term goals fathers and mothers have for their children and how harsh discipline affects the achievement of those goals, and to provide parents with positive parenting skills and techniques.

1. Explain that in this activity the group will think about the future they would like for their new child and how harsh discipline affects the achievement of those goals.

## Part 1: Your Child's Future:

2. Tell the group:

<!-- image -->

'Having a baby is joyful, exciting, exhausting and a big challenge. Parents feel like they have an extraordinary responsibility to ensure the health and happiness of their child. But very few of us ever received instructions on how to raise a child. Many times, we learn by doing or by remembering how our parents raised and disciplined us. But many instincts related to parenting are emotional reactions, and sometimes we are at risk of repeating harmful behaviors that we experienced during our own childhood.'

3. Ask participants to close their eyes and imagine the following:

<!-- image -->

'Your child is all grown up and is now turning 5 years old. What kind of relationship do you want with your children when they are 20?'

4. Next, tell the participants that they are going to work as a couple. Explain that they should discuss together and identify 5 characteristics they want their child to have when he or she is 20, or 5 long-term goals they have for their child. If both partners are not present, one parent can do this activity by him/herself.
5. Some examples of characteristics of their child in the future may be:
- Kind and helpful.
- Honest and trustworthy.
- A good decision-maker.
- Caring towards his/her parents.

14 Adapted from the activity 'My Child in 20 Years' and 'Put it into practice - positive parenting' in the Program P Manual (Promundo, REDMAS, CulturaSalud, 2013).

6. Give participants 10 minutes to discuss the characteristics they desire for their child. After 10 minutes, open the discussion using the questions below.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

What are some of the characteristics you would like your child to have by age 20?

What kind of future do you envision for your child?

What kinds of decisions do you need to make to be able to give your child the future you want for him or her?

Do we have different expectations of boys than girls?

How does the way we raise our children affect their future? How we discipline them?

How do parents usually discipline their children?

Is violence considered a normal part of raising children?

How does yelling or hitting affect children? How might it impact the long-term goals you have for your child?

What does yelling or hitting, instead of resolving a conflict, teach children?

Do you think yelling or hitting your child will help them reach the goals you have for their future? Why or why not?

## Part 2: Positive Parenting Skills

1. Explain to the group that parenting can be especially difficult in the early years because young children cannot say what they want - they do not even know what they want. The key to effective discipline when your child does something wrong, is to see short-term challenges such as getting children to eat, as opportunities to work towards long-term goals. When you feel frustrated, this is an opportunity to teach your child new skills and work towards your vision twenty years from now!
2. Ask for two volunteers from the group. Ask one person to play the role of the parent and the other to play the role of the child (3 years old). Explain that they should imagine a scene where the parent is busy doing something and the young child keeps interrupting them. They should act out the scene where the parent gets frustrated - what does he or she do? They should imagine a realistic scene that happens in the community.

3. Give the volunteers a few minutes to plan the role-play and then act it out in front of the group.
4. After the role-play, ask the group, 'Was this scene realistic? Are there other ways that parents might respond?' Allow everyone to share his or her ideas.
5. Next, ask the group, 'What does the way that the parent reacted say to the child? What does it teach the child? How would you feel if someone reacted that way to you?'
6. Explain to the group that it is important to communicate with our children - to let them know what you expect from them and to teach them how they can live up to these expectations. Hitting or yelling at a child can make them stop doing something you perceive as bad, but it does not teach them why or how they can behave differently.
7. Tell the group that it is important to think about how you want to discipline your children so that you do not react emotionally. Tell them that you are going to share with them a few questions that you can ask yourself to help you in knowing when and how to discipline your child.
1.  Is the child doing something truly wrong? Is there a problem or have your run out of patience? If nothing was truly wrong, there is no problem.
2.  Is your child really capable of doing what you expect? Sometimes our expectations of our children are not fair or realistic for someone of their age.
3.  Did your child know at the time that he or she was doing something wrong? Sometimes our children don't know that what they did was wrong - help them to understand. If your child knew that what he or she did was wrong and did it anyway, then your child has misbehaved.
8. Remind the participants about the Stages of Child Development support sheet you gave them in the previous activity. Tell them that sometimes we get upset with our children, which can lead to violence, when our expectations of them are not realistic.
9. Tell them that now you are going to share with them some techniques that they can use with their children. Read aloud the positive discipline techniques on the next page. If available, pass out copies of the Positive Discipline Techniques: you can either read the positive discipline techniques out loud or let the participants read them in groups.

## Support Sheet:

## Positive Discipline Techniques 15

The type of discipline a parent uses influences the type of person a child becomes. What type of discipline do you use? What type of person do you want your child to be? Below are a few positive discipline techniques that you can use with our child:

- Fix-up - When children cause trouble or hurt another child, expect them to fix it up - or at least try to help. If they break something, ask them to help you fix it. If they make a child cry, have them help with the soothing. If they throw toys around the room, ask them to put them away.
- Ignore - The best way to deal with misbehavior aimed at getting your attention is to simply ignore it. But be sure to give attention to your children when they behave well. Children need attention for good behavior, not misbehavior.
- Be Firm - Clearly and firmly state, or even demand, that the child do what needs to be done. Speak in a tone that lets your child know that you mean what you say and that you expect the child to do as he is told. Being firm doesn't mean yelling, nagging, threatening, reasoning, or taking away privileges. Keep suggestions to a minimum, and always speak kindly, even when speaking firmly.
- Stay in Control - Act before the situation gets out of control -- before you get angry and overly frustrated and before the child's behavior becomes unreasonable.
- Separation - When children irritate one another, fight, squabble, hit or kick, have them rest or play apart for a time. Being apart for a while lets each child calm down. Then you can use other ways to encourage better behavior.
- Behavior Management - Talk with children calmly to learn what caused a disagreement. Then talk about ways to deal with it. Come to a solution that's agreeable to both you and the children. This helps children learn to be responsible for their behavior.
- Redirection - When children become too boisterous, stop them, explain why you are stopping them, and suggest another activity. When they knock over paint, give them a cloth and a pail of water to clean up the mess. When they race dangerously indoors, if possible, take them outside for a game of chase. When they throw books at each other, gather them for a story time or organize a game.
- Praise - Give more attention and praise for good behavior and less for naughty behavior. Don't make punishment a reward. Let the child know that you appreciate a good attitude and cooperation. Children respond positively to genuine respect and praise.

15  Adapted from the Program P Manual (Promundo, REDMAS, EME, 2013), inspired by 'Positive Guidance and Discipline' (1998) by Georgia Knight and Jackie Roseboro. North Carolina State University.

10. After reviewing the support sheet, divide the group into four smaller groups (3-5 people per group) and tell them that they are going to role-play a realistic scene between a child and a parent. The child is misbehaving, and the parent must use one or more of the positive discipline techniques on the support sheet to address the unwanted behavior.
11. Give the participants 10-15 minutes to plan their role-play. After 10-15 minutes, ask the groups to present their role-plays.
12. After the role-plays, open the discussion using the questions below.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

For any of the role-plays, what other forms of positive discipline could have been used?

Is there any connection between parent's experience as men/ women and the way they raise/punish their children?

Which technique would be the easiest to use with your children? Why?

Which technique would be the most difficult to use? Why? What could you do to make it easier to use?

What are other ways to discipline children of non-violent and respectful ways?

What are ways in which we can recognize children for positive behavior?

How is 'warmth' such as showing physical affection like hugging or saying, 'I love you' to your child help to reinforce good behavior?

Do you think you will use any of these techniques in your own family?

How could you encourage others to use positive discipline techniques?

## Activity 9.1:

## Learning about contraceptive methods (2 hours)

*Activity to be facilitated by one local binome*

Purpose: T o provide couples with accurate information on different contraceptive methods and answer any questions they may have.

Before the session it is important to identify one of the binomes with knowledge of reproductive health from the same village to provide information on different contraceptive methods. Invite one of the binomes with knowledge of reproductive health to give a presentation on the contraceptive methods available in the community. If possible, ask the presenter to bring samples of contraceptive methods. It is important that the binome be able to explain the different types of contraceptive methods and be able to respond to questions about side effects or other worries that couples may have about using contraceptives.

1. Explain that the group will now be able to learn about different contraceptive methods from the one of the binomes. Invite him/her to introduce him/herself.
2. Ask the binome to give a presentation on the different forms of contraceptive methods. The binome should explain to the group the different types of contraceptives that are available in the community, including:

## A. Natural methods

- Methods of breastfeeding and amenorrhea
- Fertility awareness methods
- Cycle beads methods
- Calendar methods

## B. Barrier and spermicides methods

- Male Condoms methods
- Female condom methods
- Spermicides

## C. Short term contraceptive methods

- Oral Contraceptives and Injections

## D. Long term contraceptive methods

- Implants
- Intra Uterine Devices (IUD)

## E. Permanent Methods

- Vasectomy for men
- Tubal ligation for women

The binome presentation should include information on each method, how it is used, how it prevents pregnancy, the advantages and disadvantages of different methods, and should allow opportunity for the participants to ask any questions they may have regarding different methods, including side effects. The binome can also provide information on sexual hygiene and answer any questions that couples have regarding sex and hygiene.

The binome should inform the participants that some methods are provided by CHWs such as pills, cycle beads, injections, and condoms. Other methods are available at Health center and District hospital which are implants and surgical methods (vasectomy, tubal ligation).

NOTE: The Kinyarwanda version of this manual includes detailed content on the different contraceptive methods, taken from the family planning portion of the manual used by the community health workers known as the binome.

3. After the binome has presented and the participants have asked all their questions, open the discussion using the questions below.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

Who must think about contraception? The man or the woman? Why?

How should a couple choose a contraceptive method to use?

What are some of the reasons why couples do not use family planning?

Do you worry about side effects?

How should you choose the method that is best for you?

Have you ever discussed family planning as a couple before? Why or why not?

What are some of the reasons why couples do not communicate with each other about family planning?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

'There are different contraceptive methods that couples can use to plan and space births. It is both women's and men's responsibility to seek information to avoid unwanted pregnancy. It is important for couples to talk with a health professional, and with each other, when deciding which method to use.'

## Closing Message

## Parents by accident or by choice? 16 (30 minutes)

Purpose: To reflect upon the benefits of family planning and the value of couple communication in this process; to talk about the use of condoms and other contraceptive methods.

1. Explain to the group that they are going to be discussing the impact and benefit of family planning on a family's long-term goals.
2. Tell the group that you are going to tell them a short story.

' Chris and Silas are brothers, and so they decided to get married on the same day: Chris married Justine and Silas married Louise.

In the first year of marriage the two couples each had their first child.

After the first child, Louise and Silas make the decision to use family planning to plan the timing and spacing of their children.

But Chris and Justine decide not to use family planning and in the second year of marriage, Chris and Louise had their second child.

Five years after being married, Louise and Silas have two children, while Chris and Justine have four.'

3. Explain that you are going to divide the participants into 2 groups to develop roleplays. The first group will develop a role-play about Louise and Silas, who use family planning. The second group will develop a role-play about Chris and Justine, who do not use family planning. The role-play should show the impact that using family planning, or not using it, has on the family's development.
4. Give the groups 10 minutes to prepare their role-plays. Explain that not all participants have to act in the role-play, but they should contribute ideas in the creation of the role-play.

16 Adapted from the activity 'Father by Accident or by Choice?' in the Program P Manual (Promundo, REDMAS, EME, 2013).

5. Ask both groups to act out their role-plays and then open the discussion using the questions below.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

What did you notice, or what impacted you as you were watching these role-plays?

Is there something wrong in having a large family?

Should people plan how many children they want to have and space them, meaning take time (two to three years) before having another child?

In what ways can men contribute to family planning?

Why do some men (and some women) ignore the issue of family planning?

What effects can lack of family planning have on a family?

What are the benefits of planning your family?

Is it easy or hard to discuss family planning with your partner? Why?

What could make it easier to discuss with your partner about family planning?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Each couple has the right to decide the number of children to have - including the spacing and timing. Unplanned pregnancies can put an emotional and financial strain on the family. It is important for couples to discuss the number of children they want to have and ensure they have the resources to support their children. It is important that couples talk to each other and share their wishes for the number of children they want to have and listen to each other's opinions, wishes and fears when deciding about family planning.'

## My father's impact, my mother's impact 17 (1 hour)

Purpose: To encourage men to reflect on the influences their fathers and mothers (or other female and male authority figures) had on their lives growing up, including how to use the positive influences and how to avoid the negative aspects so they do not happen again.

1. Explain to the group that they will do an activity to reflect on the influence that their mothers and fathers had on them as children growing up. Tell them that in the activity they will think about how they can learn from the positive aspects of their parents in raising their own children and how to avoid the negative aspects so that they do not happen again.
2. Before beginning, divide the participants into two groups: one group of men and one group of women. (Note: If two facilitators are present, one facilitator should lead one group through the exercise, while the other facilitator leads the other group through the exercise).

| Facilitator note   | This activity can have a serious emotional impact on participants and facilitators because violent experiences or other traumatic life events, such as abandonment, may be recollected. Therefore, it is important to give the participants emotional support during this process. Generally, this can be achieved by respectfully listening to the participants, without judging or pressuring them.   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Part 1: Our Fathers' Impact

3. Tell the group that first they will think about the influence their fathers had on them. If someone did not grow up with their father, explain that they can think of another man who was important to them during their childhood- an uncle, grandfather, older brother, etc.
4. Ask everyone to close their eyes and think about an object or a smell that reminds them of their father. It can be a book, a piece of clothing, a smell, etc.
5. Tell the group to spend a few minutes focusing on the object or the smell that they identify with their father. What emotions does this object or smell recall for them?

17  Adapted from the activity 'My Father's Impact' from the Program P Manual (Promundo, REDMAS, EME, 2013).

6. After two minutes, ask the group to open their eyes. Tell them to turn to the person sitting next to them and explain the object or smell they identified.  Ask them to share how it relates to their father, or main male role model from their childhood. Give them five minutes to share. At the end of the activity volunteers could share with the group their experiences.
7. Once everyone has finished sharing, read the statements below out loud:

## The facilitator of the men's group should ask:

- 'One thing that my father did that I want to repeat with my own children is...'
- 'One thing that my father did that I do NOT want to repeat with my own children is…'

## The facilitator of the women's group should ask :

- 'One thing that my father did that I want my husband/partner to repeat with my own children is...'
- 'One thing that my father did that I do NOT want my husband/partner to repeat with my own children is…'
8. Then, explain that each person should think about these two statements, imagining how they would like themselves or their partner to behave in raising their children. Ask them to share their thoughts with the person sitting next to them. Give them 1015 minutes to share.

## Part 2: Our Mothers' Impact

1. Next, ask everyone to close their eyes again and think about an object or a smell that reminds them of their mother. If someone did not grow up with their mother, explain that they can think of another woman who was important to them during their childhood- an aunt, grandmother, older sister, etc.
2. Tell the group to spend a few minutes focusing on the object or the smell that they identify with their mother. What emotions does this object or smell recall for them?
3. After two minutes, ask the group to open their eyes. Tell them to turn to the person sitting next to them and explain the object or smell and how it relates to their mother, or main female role model from their childhood. Give them five minutes to share.
4. Once everyone has finished sharing, read the statements below out loud:

## The facilitator of the women's group should ask:

- 'One thing that my mother did that I want to repeat with my own children is... '

1

- 'One thing that my mother did that I do NOT want t o repeat with my own children is…'

## The facilitator of the men's group should ask:

- 'One thing that my mother did that I want my partner/wife to repeat with my own chil dren is... '
- 'One thing that my mother did that I do NOT want my partner/wife to repeat with my own children i s…'
5. Then, explain that each person should think about these two statements, imagining how they would like themselves or their partner to behave in raising their children.
6. Ask them to share their thoughts with the person sitting next to them. Give them 1015 minutes to share.
7. After 10-15 minutes, bring the groups of men and women back together in a larger group and open the discussion using the group discussion questions. Be aware that men and women may not be fully comfortable to share all these thoughts with their partners; remember that sharing is voluntary!

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

- Ask the men - What are the positive things about your relationship with your father that you would like to put into practice or teach to your children?
- Ask the women - What are the positive things about your relationship with your father that you would like to see your children have with their father?
- Which parts of your relationships with your fathers would you rather leave behind?
- How do you think traditional definitions of what it means to 'be a man' impacted the way your fathers cared for you? [Some examples: Men cannot cry; men should not express physical affection to sons such as kissing or hugging; men don't care for babies; men use violence to resolve conflict.]
- Ask the women - What are the positive things about your relationship with your mother that you would like to put into practice or teach to your children?

- Ask the men - What are the positive things about your relationship with your father that you would like to see your children have with their mother?
- Which parts of your relationships with your mothers would you rather leave behind?
- How do traditional definitions of what it means to 'be a woman' impact the ways that women are raised and cared for? [Examples: Women are responsible for raising children and doing domestic work, women are weaker, etc.]
- What do you expect of your partner as a mother?
- How can we 'leave behind' harmful practices to be more involved and gender equitable partners? And be more involved and gender equitable parents for our children?
- How can couples work together to be the parents that they want to be for their children?
- How important is communication between parents for raising happy children?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Who we are today was shaped by our experiences growing up. But they do not have to determine who we will become in the future. Reflecting on our own past enables us to make positive choices for the future by replacing negative attitudes and behaviors with positive ones. By working together and discussing their expectations as parents, men and women can support each other to be the best parents they can be.'

## Our family vision 18   (45 minutes)

Purpose: To reflect on men's and women's goals for their children and their family and how they can work together to achieve their long-term family vision.

1. Explain that in this activity each couple will think about the goals they have for their family and create a shared family vision for the future.
2. Ask the participants to close their eyes. Read the following statements aloud slowly so that the group members can consider each sentence as you read them.
3. Ask the participants to keep their eyes closed and think about this vision for the future and what it looks like.
4. After a few minutes, ask the participants to turn to their partner/spouse (if present at the meeting) and share their vision for the family. Each partner, starting with the female partner, should take a few minutes and describe their vision for the family. During that time, the other partner should sit quietly and listen to what his partner is sharing. After, the partners will switch places: the man will share his vision while his partner listens.
5. After all the couples' have shared their vision with each other, ask everyone to come back to the circle.
6. Ask the group:

<!-- image -->

18  Adapted from the Facilitator Handbook developed by Promundo-US for World Fish in Zambia.

<!-- image -->

- How did it feel to share your vision with your partner?
- How did it feel to listen to your partner's vision?
- When you shared your family vision with your partner, were your visions similar or different?
- Was anything surprising?
7. Next, ask each couple to sit together and come up with 2 or 3 long-term goals they want their family to achieve. If they prefer, participants can write these goals down on paper or draw them, but this is not required.
8. After couples have completed discussing their long-term goals for their families, ask if any couple feels comfortable to share their family vision with the group.
9. Allow enough time for participants who want to share their family vision to do so. Remember, sharing is not required.

## Facilitator note

After each couple has shared, you may invite other participants to provide positive, constructive feedback on group members' visions, guided by the group agreements.

## Group Discussion Questions:

- Is it common for men and women to discuss the vision they have for their family's future and how they can work together to achieve it? Why or why not?
- How important is it for men and women to have a shared vision and work together for the development and well-being of the family?
- Do you think this exercise will be helpful to your family?
- Do traditional gender roles, or expectations of how men and women should behave, make it difficult for men and women to achieve their family vision? If so, how?
- How can women's economic participation contribute to the family vision? How does this affect a couples' relationship?

<!-- image -->

1

- How can men's resistance to supporting women's economic empowerment affect the achievement of the family vision?
- In which ways can men support their partners/wives to participate in economic opportunities to help achieve the family vision (for example, access to information regarding loans, direct financial support for their income-generating activities, support, and encouragement in taking paid work, and other initiatives etc.)
- How can men's participation in caring for children and doing household chores help to contribute to achieve the family vision?
- How can your participation in these meetings help to contribute to achieving your family vision?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

<!-- image -->

'Communication between partners is important for setting goals for your family. Men and women working together as a couple - such as supporting each other to work, sharing household responsibilities, and encouraging each other as parents - can help you to achieve these goals and support the health, happiness, and economic prosperity of your family.'

## Activity 11.1:

## What is power? 19  (45 minutes)

Purpose: To increase participants' awareness of power and the different forms it takes and to reflect on their own experiences of feeling powerless and powerful.

1. Explain to the group that in this activity they are going to explore what power is and how it impacts the lives of men and women.
2. Ask the group: 'What does 'power' mean to you?' Allow the participants to exchange their ideas and opinions.
3. Next, ask the participants to close their eyes and think of a memory of a time they felt powerless.

8. After the group has shared different examples, explain that power can be positive or negative depending on a person's own experience.
9. Explain to the group that there are four different types of power. Read out the names of the four different types of power (if available, you can write the four types of power on a flipchart):
- Power over
- Power to
- Power with
- Power within
10. Ask the participants to share their ideas about what each of the four types of power mean, and where possible, to provide an example.
11. After the group has had a chance to share their ideas and examples, read the definitions of each type of power to the group:
- Power over: means the power that one person or group uses to control another person or group. An example would be the power that a man was given by the culture and use it to control the members of the family including the wife and children through which he can commit a violence.
- Power to: means the beliefs and actions that individuals and groups use to create positive change. This kind of power is behind the concept of empowerment. 'Power to' enables a person to gain control over his or her life. An example would be an individual teaching another community member about how to grow products such as mushrooms.
- Power with: means the power that we have when two or more people come together to do something that they could not do alone (power together). This is a collective sense of empowerment, through organizing and uniting for a common purpose or common understanding. 'Power with' is experienced when a group comes together to work to tackle common problems such as access to latrines or creating community centres.
- Power within: means power that lives within an individual. It is a personal strength and uniqueness based on self-acceptance and self-respect, which in turn extends to respect for others and acceptance of others as equals. It is different than 'power to' in that it refers to individuals finding strength and positive change within themselves, while power to refers to strength and change for other individuals.
12. Divide participants into pairs. Ask each pair to discuss with each other examples of times when they thought they had used or had experienced each of these types of power.

13. Give the pairs 5 minutes to discuss.
14. After 5 minutes, ask everyone to come back to the larger group.
15. Ask for a few volunteers to share examples of their experiences of using or experiencing each type of power.
16. Thank the volunteers for sharing and then start a group discussion using the questions below:

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

Did you notice any similarities or differences between the examples that were shared?

In what ways are men powerful?

In what ways are women powerful?

Is there a difference in how men use power and how women use power?

Who normally has power in society? Who normally does not have power?

What are some of the ways that our society promotes or supports relationships in which some people have power over other people?

How do power imbalances affect us in our relationships with other people?

How can people work together to generate more positive uses of power?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

'Power has many different faces and meanings. Power often exists in relationship to other people. We are constantly moving in and out of situations and relationships where we have more or less power. Sometimes we use power in ways that are harmful to those around us, and sometimes other people use their power in ways that are harmful to us. However, each of us has the ability to use power in positive ways. We can work together to make positive changes that can help to develop our families and communities.'

## Closing Message

1

## Activity 11.2:

## Persons and things 20  (45 minutes)

Purpose: To reflect on how men demonstrate 'power over' in their own relationships and to promote more equitable relationships and sharing of power within the family.

1. Explain to the group that this activity is designed to help us think a little bit more about how we sometimes experience and use 'power over' others in our relationships.
2. Tell the participants that there are often times when one person has 'power over' another person. We face these situations every day, in our interactions with our family and friends, at work and in the community.
3. Explain that the group will do an exercise to understand what it means to be in a situation of 'power over' another person and to think about how they exert power over others in their daily lives.
4. Ask the participants to divide into two equal groups.
- a. Participants in Group 1 will be ' things. '
- b. Participants in Group 2 will be ' persons.'
5. Read the following directions to the group:
- a.   Participants who are things: You cannot think, feel or make decisions. You must do what the 'persons' tell you. If you want to move or do something, you must ask the person for permission.
- b.   Participants who are persons : You can think, feel, and make decisions. You can also tell the 'things' what to do.

| Facilitator note   | This activity can cause some discomfort for the participants because they will experience what it feels like to be treated not like a human being, but as an object. Be prepared to lighten the mood after the activity with a short energizer, song, or a dance to help the participants relax and smile.   |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

20 Adapted from the activity 'Persons and Things' in the Program M Manual (Promundo, Instituto PAPAI, ECOS, Salud y Genero, World Education, 2007).

| Facilitator note   | It may be helpful to have two volunteers first act out for the group how a'person'might treat a'thing.' During the activity, ensure that the participants continue to respect the group agreements. This activity is about demonstrating power over others, but you should not let anyone mistreat another participant.   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

6. Ask each 'person' to pair up with a 'thing.' All participants should now be in pairs (groups of 2). If there are an unequal number of participants, one group can have 3 participants.
7. Explain that on the count of 3, 'persons' can tell the 'things' what to do. For example: jump up and down, spin around, sit on the ground, etc. 1, 2, 3…
8. After 2 minutes, ask the group to stop. Explain that two groups will reverse roles: 'Persons' will become 'things,' and 'things' will become 'persons.' The new 'persons' now have 2 minutes to tell the 'things' what to do. 1, 2, 3…
9. After 2 minutes, ask the participants to sit down in the circle and begin a discussion using the questions below:

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

- When you were 'things' - How did it feel to be treated like a thing?
- When you were 'persons' - How did it feel to treat someone like an object?
- Do 'power over' relationships exist in families in our community?
- In our daily life, do we ever treat others like 'things'?  Why?
- In our culture, the man is seen as the head of the household. What powers does this give to men in the family? How can this influence their relationship with their partner? With their children?
- How can this negatively affect your relationship with your spouse/partner if power is not shared equally?
- How can inequitable power dynamics (relationships) lead to conflict or unhappiness in the family?

1

- What might be the impact for children or other members of the family?
- What would the benefits of husbands and wives share power more equitably - for women? For Men? For the family?
- How can equitable power or sharing of power result in happier and healthier families?
- How can men and women work together to promote more positive relationships - using power to or power within - to promote happier, healthier, and more successful families?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Power imbalances can exist in our relationships, including our relationships with our partners, children and other family members. Sometimes power imbalances can lead one person to treat another person like an object. They can also reduce a person's ability to make decisions about their bodies and their lives. Thinking about these connections can help you to construct more equitable relationships with those around you. By sharing power, men and women can work together to achieve their shared goals.'

## Activity 11.3:

## What is violence? 21 (1 hour)

Purpose: To identify different types of violence and to discuss the types of violence that most commonly occur in families and romantic relationships.

1. Explain that the purpose of the activity they are going to do is to discuss what violence is and the different types of violence that exist.
2. Ask the group, 'What is violence ?' Allow them to share their opinions. You can write down the responses on a flipchart if you prefer.
3. After everyone has shared their ideas, explain to the group that at its simplest level, violence is 'the use of force or the threat of force by one individual against another.' Violence is not a random act. It happens in specific circumstances and settings. Violence happens more frequently in some settings than others.
4. Tell the group that acts of violence can be divided into four broad categories:
- Physical violence: Using physical force such as hitting, slapping, kicking, burning, or pushing.
- Emotional or Psychological violence: Often the most difficult form of violence to identify. It may include humiliating, threatening, insulting, pressuring, and expressions of jealousy or possessiveness such as the controlling of decisions and activities. It can also include restricting someone's movements. This form of violence can be verbal or nonverbal.
- Sexual violence: Pressuring or forcing someone to perform sexual acts (from kissing to sex) against their will or making sexual comments that make someone feel humiliated or uncomfortable. It does not matter if the person has previously consented to sexual behavior - consent must be given at the time.
- Economic violence: When someone else exercises complete control over a person's money and other economic resources. This type of violence is a way of exerting power and can be used to control someone's movements, for example keeping them from meeting friends, etc.
5. Ask the group whether anyone can give an example of a form of physical violence that is common in the community. Psychological violence? Sexual violence? Economic violence? After examples have been given, open the discussion using the questions below.

- Violence that I have used
- Violence that I have witnessed
4. Explain that each person should think about the violence they have used, experienced , and witnessed in their own lives and write a short reply for each one on a separate sheet of paper. Each person should write at least one reply for each category. Explain that they should not write much, just a few words or a phrase. They should not write their names. Give them 10 minutes to write down their responses.

| Facilitator note   | Discussing violence, especially violence that a person has personally experienced, can be very difficult. It is recommended to end the session with a fun, light energizer (for example, a song or dance) to help the participants smile and relax. It can also be a pledge where the participants commit to ending violence in their communities.   |

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Too many of us have experienced or witnessed violence at some point in our lives and often this violence is considered normal. All of us are capable of perpetrating and experiencing violence however, violence is a learned behavior, and as such, it can also be unlearned.'

1

## Activity 12.2:

## Speaking out about violence 23  (1 hour)

Purpose: To discuss the culture of silence surrounding violence in families and romantic relationships and to reflect on what men can do if they know someone in an abusive relationship and how to prevent domestic violence in the community.

1. Explain to the participants that the next activity will focus on how men can break the silence surrounding violence families and relationships and what they can do if they see someone in an abusive relationship or if they know someone who is perpetrating violence against a partner.
2. Tell the group that violence, particularly violence that occurs between partners and in the family, is something that we often do not talk about. Men and women are often hesitant to reach out to someone who they know is in an abusive relationship, or to someone who they know is using violence against his partner.
3. Ask the group, 'What is men's role in breaking the silence about violence?' Allow the participants to share their own ideas and opinions.
4. Next, divide the participants into two groups and tell them they will have 15 minutes to create a role-play about the difficulties of breaking the silence and speaking about the violence. Assign each group a scenario to act out:
- Group 1: create a role-play that presents the challenges men face and the reasons why they may not reach out and support someone who is experiencing violence from a partner. Tell them to think about the concerns or reasons that a person (bystander) might not want to reach out and support this person (for example, a friend, family member, neighbor, etc.)
- Group 2: create a role-play that presents the challenges men face and the reasons why they may not reach out to someone who they know is using violence against his partner (for example, a friend, family member, neighbor, etc.)
5. After 15 minutes, ask both groups to present their role-plays. Then, use the questions below to discuss the difficulties in speaking about violence and to identify some possible solutions.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

In general, do we speak up when we know someone who is experiencing violence? When we know someone who is using violence? Why or why not?

Are there ways that people speak about violence or women that make violence seem natural or acceptable? For example: proverbs or songs?

23 Adapted from the activity 'Breaking the Silence and Getting Help' from the Program M Manual (Promundo, Instituto PAPAI, Salud y Genero, ECOS, World Education, 2007.

How can men break the silence about violence?

What are some of the challenges you might face as men speaking out against violence against women?

How does it feel when you know that someone you care about is suffering from violence?

How can you talk to that person about violence? What steps can you take to help someone in a violent relationship?

On the other hand, what steps can you take to stop someone you know is using violence?

What can men do to stop and prevent gender-based violence in the community?

Did you learn anything in  this activity that you will take with you in your own life?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

Closing Message

'It can be very difficult for women and men who suffer violence to seek help, and it is often difficult for us to speak out about violence and help those in need. Speaking out about violence is an important step towards breaking the cycle of violence.'

5. After a few volunteers have shared their feedback on the homework assignment, thank them for sharing their experiences.

## Activity 13.1:

## Who does the care work? 24  (45 minutes)

Purpose: To reflect on how gender roles influence the distribution of care work, including caring for children and household tasks, within the household and to encourage a more equitable distribution of housework between men and women.

1. Explain to the participants that this activity will help them to reflect on how gender roles influence the distribution of childcare and household tasks within the household.
2. Ask five male group members to volunteer to participate in a role-play.
3. Explain that each of the volunteers will represent a member of a household doing housework or childcare activities. Assign each participant a role:
- 1st person is caring for a child.
- 2nd person is cooking the dinner.
- 3rd person is washing the clothes.
- 4th person is sweeping the house.
- 5th person is collecting water.
4. Give the volunteers one minute to prepare their character. Tell them that on the count of three the role-play will begin, and they should not stop doing their household task until you tell them.
5. Begin the role-play...One, two, three!
6. After one minute, ask the person who is caring for the child to stop. Tell the person to give the task of caring for the child to one of the four remaining people in the household. Explain that the person who receives the child to now must care for the child in addition to their other task. Let the role-play continue for one minute.

8. After one minute, ask the 3rd person, who is washing the clothes, to stop and give his duty to another member of the household. The two remaining household members should now be sharing all 5 duties. Let the role-play continue for 30 seconds.
9. After 30 seconds, tell the 4th person to stop and give his duty to the last remaining household member. Remind the remaining household member that he is now responsible for all 5 duties.
10. After 30 seconds, ask the last person to stop working and sit down. Open the discussion using the questions below:

## Group Discussion Questions:

## Ask the role-play participants:

<!-- image -->

- How did you feel doing this exercise?
- How did the people who were still working feel when the others stopped?
- How did the last worker feel?
- Which of these activities do you perform at home?

## Ask the group:

- Ask the women - How did you all feel watching the men in the role play?
- Who generally performs the activities from the role-play in the home? Why?
- Some people say that 'a woman's work is never done.' How do you feel about that statement?
- Why is it that many men and boys are usually not responsible for household activities like cooking, cleaning, or caring for the children, etc.?
- There is some evidence that boys who saw their fathers participate in housework were more likely to do it later in life themselves. What are your thoughts on this?
- How can it negatively impact the lives of women and girls when they are expected to perform all these activities? What happens when women also participate in paid work?

Facilitator note

For example, women have a significant time burden based on societal and family expectations that they will complete all the childcare and household tasks; there are also physical demands of specific tasks, such as fetching water or firewood, which can cause health problems over the longterm.

<!-- image -->

- Are there specific household tasks that men could take a more active role in to reduce this negative impact?
- What can men gain from being more involved in household work like cooking and cleaning? How would women benefit? Children?
- Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:
- 'Women and men are raised to perform different caregiving roles, with women usually bearing a significant proportion of the childcare and domestic work. However, men are capable of sharing the care work, and when they do it can bring benefits to their partners, their children, and themselves.'

1

## Activity 13.2:

## Hours in a day (1 hour)

Purpose: To reflect on how men and women spend their time and how gender roles and expectations influence men's and women's time spent on unpaid and paid work.

1. Explain that in this activity the group is going to reflect on the different ways that men and women spend their days and the time they devote to certain tasks.
2. Divide the participants into smaller groups (4-6 people) based on their sex. Men should be in small groups together with other men, and women should be in small groups together with other women. Give each group a piece of paper or a flipchart and a pen or marker.
3. Ask each group to imagine a typical day in the lives of a wife and husband in their community and to identify the activities or tasks performed by women and men in a household over 24 hours, starting from when they wake up in the morning. The women should identify the tasks typically performed by women on an average day, and the men should identify the tasks typically performed by men on an average day.
4. Explain that each group can decide how they want to represent the activities and time spent over 24 hours. Option 1: list out or draw all the activities performed in a day and how much time is spent on them. Option 2: use a circle to depict what proportion of time is spent on each task in 24 hours.

Option 1:

| Sleeping   | 7 hours   |
|------------|-----------|
| Cooking    | 2 hours   |
| Laundry    | 1 hour    |
| …          | …         |
| …          | …         |

<!-- image -->

5. After about 15-20 minutes, ask everyone to come back to the circle.
6. Place on the floor two signs, one representing a man and another a woman. Pass out the stones and leaves to the group.
7. Explain that each group is going to present their 24-hour day. After each activity is mentioned, the group must decide whether that activity is 'paid' or 'unpaid'. If an activity is 'paid' , they should put a stone on the picture. If an activity is 'unpaid' , they should put a leaf on the picture.
8. Ask each group to briefly present what they wrote, pictured, or discussed within their group. As they are presenting the volunteers will be placing either the stone or the leaf on the appropriate place based on the group agreement.
9. After the presentations are finished, start the discussion using the questions below:

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

What differences do you notice between the ways in which men and women spend their days?

Who generally carries out more activities or tasks during the day? Men or women?

Who generally has more leisure time to spend with friends or family? Men or women?

Do you think these differences are fair? Why or why not?

Why do we tend to undervalue domestic work such as cooking or cleaning, and time spent caring for children? And why is paid work seen as having more value?

Why is it that most of the time men are the ones involved in paid work?

Why is it that women are less involved in paid work?

In our families, do we generally show appreciation for women and girls for the time and effort they spend on unpaid tasks?

1

Are there ways that men and women can work together in the family to share responsibilities, so that both are able to participate in both paid and unpaid work if they choose to?

What are some of the benefits of men and women working together on these activities? For women? For men? For the family?

How could this help families to achieve their family vision?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'We tend to value paid work more than unpaid work, such as household tasks and child are. However, these activities are integral to the health, wellbeing, and success of our families. When men and women work together to complete the household tasks, both will have more time to work and participate in activities that will help the family to prosper.'

## Activity 13.3:

## Sharing household responsibilities (45 minutes)

Purpose: To discuss how men can share more of the household tasks and to reflect on the importance of women and men communicating their expectations about these tasks.

1. Explain that in this activity, the group is going to reflect on how men can take greater responsibility for and share in the household tasks, and the importance of spouses/ partners communicating about these tasks.
2. First, ask for four volunteers to create a role play: in a household in this community, a woman has gone to sell potatoes in the market. While she is gone, her husband stays at home with their two children, feeding and bathing them, and doing some of the other household chores. What happens when she comes home to find what her husband has done and is not happy with what he has done?
3. Give the volunteers 5 minutes to discuss and prepare their role plays.
4. Begin the role play... 1, 2, 3!
5. After each role play, ask the group for feedback on the role play: 'How realistic was the role play? Why or why not?'
6. Next, ask the group:
- What do women expect of men in relation to housework?
- Do men and women discuss openly their expectations about what housework needs to be done and how it should be done?
- Does household work ever contribute to conflict in families?
- Are there ways that men and women could discuss and share these responsibilities, so that they do not fall on only one person?
- How can women support and encourage men's participation in household work?
7. Next, ask for four new volunteers to redo the role play. This time, the couple discusses about their expectations of what should be done in the homme before the woman leaves for the market. They talk openly and agree on how to share responsibilities while she is out selling items to earn an income for the family. How would their interactions differ this time around?

<!-- image -->

1

8. Give the volunteers 5 minutes to discuss and prepare their role plays.
9. Begin the role play... 1, 2, 3!
10. After the second role play, open the group discussion:

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

- What did you think about the second role play?
- How can communicating about household tasks and our expectations for them improve our family relationships?
- What are one or two things you can do differently this week to share responsibilities more fairly in the home?
- Do men face any backlash when they participate in household tasks?  (For example, from their partners? Friends? Neighbors? Other family members?)
- Do women face any backlash when their husbands/partners participate in household tasks?
- What could be done to address this backlash?
- Did you learn anything in this activity?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Women and men are capable of sharing the care work - the key is discussing and communicating a fair distribution of tasks that is right for each family. Communicating our expectations of what needs to be done, and how or when it should be done, can also make it easier to share these responsibilities, reduce the time spent on household tasks, and avoid potential conflict in your relationships.'

## Check-out (15 minutes)

1. Explain that the session is ending and that it is time for the 'check-out.'
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session?
3. After finishing the questions, assign this week's homework assignment:

Homework: This week each couple is asked to go home and talk about the distribution of care work within the home and to think about how these tasks could be more equitably shared. In addition, each man is asked to perform at least one domestic activity that they usually never do (after discussion with your partner).

4. Thank everyone for coming and inform the group that the next session is for men and women. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session.

She wants to join the local producer group that is growing mushrooms that the Tubura project is organizing, but her husband won't let her because he feels it is not her role to earn money for the family. He makes all the important decisions in the family on his own, often without even discussing it with her. Yesterday evening he came home and told her that he had purchased a bicycle, even though the family is struggling to pay their rent and afford items that they need for their children.  She doesn't know how much money her husband earns, and he often spends money on things that she feels they cannot afford.

3. After reading the story ask the group the following questions:
- Do you know families like this in your community?
- How common is this situation?
- What are some of the negative impacts on women when men are the main decision-makers in the family (for example, their health, workload, etc.)?

- Are there any negative impacts on men when they are the main decision-makers in the family (for example, their health, workload, etc.)?
- What are some of the negative impacts for children when they see only their fathers making all the decisions?
- If only one person from the family makes all the major decisions, how does this negatively impact the family vision that we discussed in the previous sessions?
4. Next, read the second story aloud to the group.

## Family 2:

Kalisa and Mukashema live in the same community as the first family we discussed. They have been married for six years and have two small children. Kalisa also works in the potato fields. Mukashema recently joined the Tubura producer group growing mushrooms. The husband and wife both want to be able to develop their family and provide a better future for their children, so each week they sit and discuss how they spend their money. They decide together any large purchases or investments. They've recently heard about a savings group and have discussed and agreed that Mukashema will join the group to help them set aside some money in savings. They are hoping to be able to save to purchase some additional inputs to help them start new income-generating activities.

5. After reading the second story ask the group the following questions:
- Do you know families like this in your community?
- How common is this situation?
- How do you see these families? Has sharing decisions brought any benefits to their household?

| Facilitator note   | Through the discussion, encourage participants to think of the different benefits or advantages to men and women sharing decisions, including how joint decision-making can benefit men, women, and children.   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

- Do you think it is realistic for men and women to share decision-making power within the family? Why or why not?
- Are there benefits to men and women sharing power and making decisions together?
- What are some of the positive impacts for families when husband and wives make decisions together? For women? For men?
- Are there any disadvantages to sharing decisions? Why or why not?
- How can men and women sharing decision-making power contribute to the economic development of the household?

Thank the participants for sharing their ideas and opinions and share the following key message, before beginning part 2 of the activity.

## Closing Message

'Men are often raised to be head of the household and to have the final say in household decisions. As such, men often control access, use and decisions about household finances, resources, and even how family members spend their time. This can have a negative impact on women, children, and men themselves. When men and women discuss and share household decision-making power, it can have many positive benefits.

Equitable household decision-making means men and women sharing power, discussing, and agreeing on decisions together. Not all decisions need to be made in this way, for example, there are important decisions that each person should be able to make for themselves, particularly those regarding their own bodies and their time. However, when men and  women decide important decisions affecting the household together, it is easier to achieve the goals that they have for their families.'

## Part two:

1. Divide the participants into two smaller groups: one group of only men, and one group of only women. One facilitator should lead each group. Ask for a volunteer in each group who will present a summary of what the group discussed to the larger group.

2. Once the groups have been divided, ask the following questions:

## The facilitator of the women's group should ask:

<!-- image -->

3. After the small groups have finished discussing, ask the participants to come back to the circle.
4. Ask a volunteer from the women's group to share a summary of what the women's discussed. Next, ask a volunteer from the men's group to summarize the men's discussion.
5. Ask the group if anyone would like to comment on what was shared. Does anyone have any suggestions for how men and women can share decision-making power?
6. After any suggestions have been shared, end the activity with the closing statement:

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'There are many benefits that come when men and women participate equally in decisions that affect themselves and their families. It is often easier to make decisions when you can discuss and advise each other. It also reduces the burden on one person to make decisions. Equitable decision-making requires sharing power between men and women, but it brings many positive benefits for men, women, children and the household in general.'

## Activity 14.2:

## Discussing family finances (1 hour)

Purpose: To discuss men's and women's spending priorities in the family and to learn how men and women can work together to create a household budget that supports the wellbeing of their children.

1. Explain to the participants that they are going to do an activity to help them think about how families manage their money and the different priorities that men and women have for spending money within the household.
2. Tell the group that they are going to break into two groups - one group of men and one group of women - to discuss the priorities that men and women in the community usually have for their household budgets. Each group will discuss together and then will share what they discussed with the larger group afterwards.
3. Divide the participants into the two groups, each with their own facilitator. Have the groups move into different parts of the room or separate spaces.
4. In the small groups, ask the following questions, based on the sex of the participants.

## The facilitator in the men's group should ask:

What priorities do men in the community generally have for spending the household budget? (For example: nutrition for pregnant women and children (especially during the first 1000 days), school fees to send the children to school; health insurance; investing in income-generating activities; constructing a new roof, etc.) Why do you think these are their priorities?

How do expectations about what it means to be a man influence the way that men approach household finances?

What are some challenges men face in discussing the household's finances with their wives/partners?

## The facilitator in the women's group should ask:

What priorities do women in the community generally have for spending the household budget? (For example: nutrition for pregnant women and children (especially during the first 1000 days), school fees to send the children to school; health insurance; investing in income-generating activities; constructing a new roof, etc.) Why do you think these are their priorities?

1

How do expectations of what it means to be a woman influence if or how women are involved in financial decisions within the home?

What are some of the challenges that women face in discussing the household's finances with their husbands/partners?

5. After 15 to 20 minutes, ask the groups to come back to the circle. Invite 1 representative from each group to share some of the feedback from the group discussion: What are women's priorities for spending? What are men's priorities for spending?
6. After the groups have presented, discuss the following questions among the group:

Ask the men - Did anything surprise you about the priorities presented by the women?

Ask the women - Did anything surprise you about the priorities presented by the men?

Why do you think women and men sometimes have different priorities for household spending?

- How can men and women work together to make financial decisions if they have different priorities?
- If men and women shared the same vision for their family, would this make household spending decisions easier?

Do you think there are benefits if women and men discuss their household spending?

7. Next, explain to the group that in addition to spouses/partners discussing the family finances, it can also be beneficial to sit together and a family budget.
8. Share with the group the steps they would take to create their family budget (If available, share copies of the Support sheet and the sample household budget). Explain that each family can sit together and create a household budget for the week or for the month using the following steps. After each step, ask the group if it is clear or not:
- Step. 1: What expenses does your family have? Sit together and write down all your costs for this week (or month) (for example, nutrition for pregnant women and children (especially during the first 1000 days), food, clothing, housing, phone, transportation, etc.).

Is this step clear to you? Is this something you could try?

- Step 2: How much do you have? Sit together and write down all the money you expect to earn for this week (or month) (for example, from selling goods at the market, money earned from employment).

Is this step clear to you? Is this something you could try?

- Step 3: Do you have enough money to cover your expenses or not? Sit together and assess whether your total weekly (or monthly) spending is more or less than your total weekly (or monthly) earnings? If your spending is more than the money you are bringing in, you can then assess how to address this by budgeting better for the next week or month.

Is this step clear to you? Is this something you could try?

- Step 4: Do we have enough for the necessities for our children? Sit together and assess which of your expenses are for things that support your children to grow and develop? Are there any needs that are not covered? Are there better ways to spend your money on your family?

Is this step clear to you? Is this something you could try?

9. Explain that creating a budget using these steps can help families to plan and to assess where they need to make changes to cover the necessities that their families require, particularly their children.
10. Next, start a group discussion using the questions below:

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

Have any of you ever created a household budget like this? What was your experience of doing this?

Would it help if couples decided household spending priorities based on how or whether a purchase or expense contributes to the family's vision and to the needs of their children?

Do households in this community ever spend money on items that do not promote their children and family's well-being? Why?

What are some ways that families with 'not enough' could generate more income for their family? (for example, both parents could work, and fathers could share in the household tasks to enable the mother to work, etc., income-generating activities, voluntary savings and loans, etc.)

Do you think that more opportunities for women to participate in economic activities could help families in this community to be more financially secure?

1

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Men and women sometimes have different priorities and ideas for how family finances should be spent. It is important to talk about these priorities and to agree together how money is spent. Talking about financial decisions can help to ensure that spending is done responsibly and contributes to the family vision. If men and women work together to discuss, agree upon and manage the finances, money can be spent in ways that most effectively contribute to the well-being of the family and more savings made.'

## Check-out (15 minutes)

1. Explain that the session is ending and that it is time for the 'check-out.'
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session?
3. After finishing the questions, assign this week's homework assignment:

Homework: This week, each couple is encouraged to discuss their family finances and consider creating a household budget. Recognize that talking about finances can be a difficult thing, so do it at your own pace, but remember the important benefits that it can bring.

4. Thank everyone for coming and inform the group that the next session is for men only. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session.

## Worksheet:

## Creating a Family Budget

The following questions can help you to develop a weekly, monthly, or annual budget for your family. Some costs only occur once in a month or twice in a year - so you need to make sure to include these when you budget for longer periods of time. Creating a long-term budget plan can help you identify the future needs of your family and save money to meet these costs. At the bottom of this page, you will also find a budget template that you can use to develop a family budget after the session ends.

1.   What expenses does your family have? Write down all your costs for this week (or month) (for example, food, clothing, housing, phone, transportation, etc.), like in the example below. Example:
2. How much does your family earn? Write down all the money you expect to earn for this week (or month) (for example, from selling goods at the market, money earned from employment), like in the example below. Example:
3.   Do you bring in 'enough' money to cover your costs or 'not enough'? Is your total weekly (or monthly) spending more than your total weekly (or monthly) earnings? If yes, what could you do to better budget the money you have?
4.   What items do you spend money on that are necessities for your children? With the money you spend, do you buy all the things your children need to grow and develop? Are there better ways to spend your money on your family?

| Item                             | Spending per week (or month)   |

## Activity 15.1:

## Sources of family conflict (1 hour)

Purpose: To discuss the common topics or sources of conflict between spouses/partners and how identifying these sources can help to avoid or reduce conflict within the family.

1. Explain that in this activity the group is going to discuss some of the common sources of conflict or disagreement between spouses/partners.
2. Divide the group into two smaller groups. Ask each group to discuss the question: 'What are the top three topics or sources of conflict between spouses in this community?' Give each group 5-10 minutes to discuss.
3. Once the groups have finished their discussions, ask them to come back to the circle. Ask each group to share the top three sources of conflict that they identified.
4. Allow both groups to share their responses. After both groups have shared, tell the group:

'RWAMREC and Promundo conducted research with couples in Rwanda, where we found that the top 3 reasons men and women cited as causes of disagreement of quarrelling in their relationship were: money, men's alcohol use, and domestic chores. How does this list compare to the issues you've identified?'

5. Next, ask each group to prepare a role play depicting a conflict or disagreement in a couple using one of the topics they identified. If both groups identified similar sources of conflict, ask each group to role play a different source of conflict. Allow each group 5-10 minutes to prepare their role play.
6. After 5-10 minutes, invite everyone back to the circle and ask each group to present their role play.
7. After the role plays, start a group discussion using the questions below.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

Facilitator note

<!-- image -->

There may be many different topics or sources of conflict among couples in the community. If these have not yet been mentioned, ask the group about: money and large household purchases, sexual relations, infidelity, household tasks, caring for children, men's alcohol use, time spent in the family, etc.

Why or how do the topics we've discussed generally contribute to conflict or disagreement between spouses/partners?

How do expectations of 'what it means to be a man' influence or contribute to conflict in our relationships with our partners?

Facilitator note

<!-- image -->

For example, men are often raised not to discuss their feelings, and are also raised with the idea that they should be the primary decision-makers in the family. This can contribute to a lack of communication between partners, which can lead both partners to have unclear expectations of each other, which can contribute to conflict.

How does a lack of communication between partners on these topics contribute to conflict?

For example, do men and women generally communicate their expectations or desires about sexual relations with their partners?

How does a lack of trust between partners contribute to conflict or disagreement?

How does conflict between parents impact the relationship between partners? Their relationships with their children?

Do we always know why our partner is upset? Does our partner know why we are upset?

How can knowing what the possible sources of conflict might be in a relationship help someone to avoid conflict on these issues? Or reduce the severity of the conflict?

What else can be done to address the common causes of disagreement between partners?

1

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'There can be many different sources of conflict in men's relationships with their partners. Men are often raised not to communicate their feelings, but when couples communicate their feelings and expectations - particularly around issues that commonly cause conflict - it can help to reduce or solve disagreements. Consider how you can improve your communication with your partner about these sensitive issues.'

## Activity 15.2:

## Resolving conflict 25  (1 hour 30 minutes)

Purpose: To reflect on some of the positive and negative ways that we react when we are angry and to practice non-violent ways to react that can help to resolve or avoid conflict.

1. Explain that the purpose of this activity is to think about how men react when they have a disagreement with their spouse/partner, and what men can do when they feel angry.
2. Tell the group that you want them to think about the scenarios that were discussed in the previous activity. Imagine they have a disagreement with their partner.
- What are some of the negative ways of reacting when we are angry?
- What are some of the positive ways of reacting when we are angry?
- Where do we learn these ways of reacting when we are angry?
- Do our fathers influence the way that we react? Do we use the same methods as they did?
- Does anger often lead to violence? Does it have to?
- Is it easier to control our anger with some people compared with others? (For example, at work compared to at home in the family)
3. Now, explain that you are going to do a role-play with two volunteers. Ask two people from the group to volunteer to play a married couple who are disagreeing over something and shouting at each other. Ask the volunteers to act out the situation where the disagreement escalates and one of the partners reacts in an impulsive or violent way.
4. After the role-play, ask the group: 'how realistic was the role play? Did any of you recognize some of your personal experiences in the situation that was depicted?'
5. Next, explain that how we communicate our frustration during an argument or disagreement can contribute to the situation getting out of control, or make it less likely that the conflict will be resolved. Ask the group:
- Which type of communication style do men usually use in an argument:
- Aggressive communication: Asking for what you want or saying how you feel in a threatening, sarcastic, challenging, or humiliating way.
- Assertive communication: Asking for what you want or saying how you feel in an honest and respectful way, so it

does not infringe on another person's rights or put him or her down.

- Passive communication: Expressing your own needs and feelings so weakly that they will not be heard.
- What type of communication style do women usually use?
- How do these communication styles contribute to conflict?
- Do we generally give time to share our feelings during an argument? To listen to our partners? To truly discuss the problem?
6. Next, share with the group some of the practical methods that they can use to control their anger from the support sheet.

## Practical Methods to Control Anger Support Sheet:

## Step away from the situation, leave or take a walk ('to take a breath of fresh air'):

To calm down, walk away and count to 10, breathe deeply, walk around, or do a physical activity. This will 'cool your head' and clarify your ideas. It is also important that people who are angry share their feelings with the other person involved. For example, you can say 'I am very angry right now and I need to leave. I need to do something now like go for a walk, so I can release my anger. When I cool down and feel calm, I would like to talk and resolve this.'

## Use words to express your feelings without attacking:

Express anger without 'attacking.' For example, 'I am angry because…' or 'I would like you to know…' Another example: if your partner is late to meet you somewhere, you could yell something like, 'You fool, you're always late, and I have to wait for you all the time.' Or you can use words without attacking or offending. For example, say, 'I am upset because you were late. I wish you had arrived at the scheduled time or warned me that you were going to be late.'

7. Ask the group: Can anyone think of other techniques that can be used when someone is angry, so that it does not lead to violence or exacerbate the conflict? Allow the group to share their ideas.

8. Next, ask two volunteers to act out a situation in which the couple comes to a mutual agreement, considering the methods discussed above, or other non-violent forms of conflict resolution.
9. After the volunteers have presented the role-play, open the discussion using the questions below.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

Ask the actors - How did the first role-play compare with the second? How did you feel in the first role-play versus the second?

Is it generally difficult for men to express their frustration or anger without using violence? Why or why not?

If you are having a disagreement with your partner, who can you turn to for advice?

We often know how to avoid a conflict without using violence, but sometimes this does not happen. Why?

Are the methods we discussed for preventing arguments from leading to violence useful or realistic? Why or why not?

Can anyone provide an example in which they disagreed strongly with their partner on something, but resolved it without yelling or using violence?

Is it easy to talk to our partners about the problems we face as husbands and fathers?

What does a healthy, respectful relationship look like?

How could relationships improve if men communicated their expectations and feelings with their partners, before an  issue leads to a disagreement or conflict?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

'Communication is a key part of healthy relationships. We have a responsibility to control ourselves when we feel angry or upset. Communicating our feelings is more effective than violence at resolving conflicts. Developing an effective communication style is key in any successful relationship as well as in parenthood! Men can help by clarifying their own desires in nonviolent ways.'

## Closing Message

1

## Check-out (15 minutes)

1. Explain that the session is ending and that it is time for the 'check-out.'
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session?
3. After finishing the questions, assign this week's homework assignment:

Homework: This week, consider how you communicate with your partner and children. If you do have a disagreement, consider how you can use some of the techniques that were discussed during the session.

4. Thank everyone for coming and inform the group that the next session is for men only. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session.

## Activity 16.1:

## What do we know about alcohol? 26 (45 minutes)

Purpose: To encourage discussion about alcohol abuse and related problems and consequences for men.

1. Explain that the purpose of the activity is to discuss alcohol use and the consequences it has for men and their families.
2. Ask all of participants to stand in a circle. Tell the participants that they will have to toss the ball from one person to another randomly.
3. Explain that the person who receives the ball needs to give one reason (positive or negative) why men use alcohol. Make it clear that right now they are only focusing on the 'reasons' for alcohol use, not the consequences. Encourage the participants to give a different reason from the others who have gone before them.
4. Start the activity by tossing the ball to someone. Let the participants toss the ball until everyone has received the ball or until the group can think of no more reasons.
5. Stop the participants and explain that they will now toss the ball and when they receive it, they have to say one 'problem' or 'consequence' caused by drinking excessively. They can include immediate problems for the man as well as long-term consequences for his family.
6. Let the participants toss the ball until everyone has received the ball or until the group can think of no more consequences. After everyone has finished tossing the ball, ask everyone to sit down in the circle and open the discussion using the questions below:

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

Do you think men generally drink more than women? Why?

Is there any connection between alcohol use and being a 'real man'?

How does excessive drinking impair our ability to be good caregivers to our children and partners to our wives?

What is the difference between healthy drinking and drinking that leads to problems?

26 Adapted from the activity 'Throw the Drunk Ball' from the Journeys of Transformation manual (Promundo, CARE International, 2012).

Is it the same for everyone? How do you know how much is too much? What are some of the reasons that people drink too much? Do you know someone who drinks too much? What are the consequences for himself and those around them? If you know a friend or neighbor who drinks excessively, what could you do to help him control his drinking? If you were drinking excessively, what do you think you would need to stop or control your drinking? What support would help you? What could you encourage others to do in order not to drink excessively? What have you learned in this activity? Is there anything you can use in your own life?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Alcohol abuse is very common in our communities. It is important to be able to differentiate between alcohol use and abuse. Excessive use of alcohol can have negative impacts on ourselves, our families and our relationships.'

## The pleasures and risks of drugs and alcohol 27 (1 hour)

Purpose: To reflect on the risks associated with things like alcohol and drugs, which give pleasure, and to discuss strategies for reducing the risks and harms related to alcohol and drugs.

1. Tell the group that in the last activity they looked at some of the risks that can come from alcohol abuse. Explain that in this activity, they are going to look at some of the risks that are associated with both alcohol and drugs and discuss some of the strategies for reducing the potential harm caused by alcohol or drug use.
2. Ask the group whether they know anyone who uses any drug or other substance besides alcohol. 'What are these substances? Why do people use them?' Encourage the group to share their ideas and experiences.
3. Explain that you are now going to divide the participants into two or three smaller groups (3-5 people per group). After the participants are divided into smaller groups, ask each group to discuss some of the risks or harms associated with using drugs or alcohol and come up with a role play reflecting that. Give the groups 10 minutes.
- Risk is the possibility of something bad happening.
- Harm refers to the negative consequence(s) that happens as a result of an action.
4. After 10 minutes, ask each group to present their role play of the risks or harms associated with using drugs or alcohol to the group. Ask the group for feedback on the role plays - what do they think about what was depicted about the risks or harms?
5. Next, brainstorm in the bigger group about some of the protective factors, or actions that men can take to help avoid or reduce the possible risks or harms posed by alcohol or drug use. As suggestions are provided by the group, ask the participants what they think of the solutions or actions proposed by the group members?

27 Adapted from the activity 'Pleasures and Risks' from the Program M Manual (Promundo, Instituto PAPAI, Salud y Genero, ECOS, World Education, 2007).

Facilitator note: Below are some possible protective factors or actions that men might take to help address some of the risks or harms posed by alcohol or drug use.

Talk with a friend or partner about any concerns you have about your alcohol or drug use.

Set limits that work for you. For example, decide on the number of drinks, how much money you can spend on alcohol, or the time of day or days of the week when you feel it's acceptable to drink.

Involve a friend, partner, or family member in encouraging and supporting you to maintain these limits.

If you decide to stop using alcohol or drugs entirely, share this plan with your friends and family, so that they can support you in achieving it.

Avoid situations or individuals that will undermine the limits you are setting for yourself, or which/who encourage you to abuse alcohol or drugs.

Swap time that you would spend drinking or taking drugs for quality time with your partner and children.

6. Next, continue the group discussion using the questions below.

## Group Discussion Questions:

<!-- image -->

What are some of the risks or harms you identified that are associated with alcohol or drug use?

Why is it important to think about the risks and harms associated with alcohol and drug use?

Are the risks different for drugs than for alcohol?

Can drinking or drug use impair our ability to make good decisions?

What can happen when we are not able to make proper decisions?

What are some of the protective factors that you identified? Why is it important to think about the protective factors associated with alcohol and drug use?

1

What is the relationship between drugs and alcohol and pleasure? What do you think is the most important protective factor or skill can we develop to help protect us from these risks?

What role do friends play in helping us to avoid risks that put us in danger? Do friends ever encourage us to do things that put us in danger?

What information or support do you think men need to practice risk reduction in their own lives?

What have you learned i n this activity? Is there anything that will be useful in your own life?

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the key message:

## Closing Message

'Many decisions in our lives come with both pleasures and risks - including the decision to drink, smoke, or use illegal drugs. It is important to be aware of the risks associated with alcohol and drug use and feel capable of minimizing the harm it might have on your life and relationships. Speaking to and asking support from your parent, friends and family can be important steps towards limiting these risks. '

By working together, men and women can achieve happy, successful, and economically productive families. This change can be sustained and expanded through support and commitment of all of those here today. I encourage all of you to continue to support each other, and seek support from your family and community, in making positive changes.'

<!-- image -->

'All of you have made a lot of personal growth and changes over the last 15 sessions. As we discussed before, change is a gradual process. It is important to reflect on the changes we have made - where we have come from - and where we would like to be in the future. Even after this group has finished, you can continue to make positive changes that will improve your lives and relationships in ways that will benefit yourselves, your partners, your children and your community.'

3. Ask everyone to close their eyes and think back to the earlier session where they developed a family vision:

<!-- image -->

'Remember the vision you imagined for your family and the long-term goals you identified. Remember the things you hoped to have achieved in five years. The things you hoped for yourself, your relationships with your partner, and your children. Think about the vision you had for your family. What do you need to maintain the positive changes you have already made? And, based on the changes you have already made, what other changes do you need to make, or actions do you need to take, to achieve this vision?'

4. Ask everyone to open their eyes, but to keep this vision in their minds. Explain that each couple will have 20 minutes to discuss privately to create an action plan of any additional changes or actions they want to take as a family to successfully achieve this vision. They should also think about who they need to involve to successfully implement the action plans.

5. Explain that these action plans do not have to be shared with the wider group, but that participants should also think of ways that the other group members can help and support them in making positive changes. Allow participants 20 minutes to work in couples.

## Activity 17.3:

## A parents' web 28  (45 minutes)

Purpose: To close the group meeting by reflecting on the time spent in the Bandebereho group and the connections made between the group members.

1. Explain to the group that this is the final 'check-out' of the group. It is designed to help the participants reflect on their experiences and the connections they have made to each other.
2. Ask the participants to stand up in a circle, shoulder to shoulder.
3. Explain that each participant is going to have the opportunity share one thing they are grateful for about the group and one thing that they learned that they will take with them back to their families. Each person will say the following statements:
- 'Something I am grateful for about this group is…'
- 'One thing I have learned that I will continue to use or share with my family is... '

Optional: if a ball of string or rope is available: Explain that each person will hold on to the end of the rope and toss the ball of rope to another person in the group. Each person should hold onto a piece of the rope before throwing the ball. This will continue until everyone has had something to say. Once everyone has finished saying what they learned, a web will have formed.

4. After everyone has shared, ask the group members to look around at everyone standing on the circle with them and to appreciate all that they have shared and experienced together.
5. Explain that there is an invisible web connecting them, which represents the sum of their experiences in this group. They are all now connected because they have acquired a new definition of what it means to be parents and partners.
6. Thank everyone once again and congratulate them on completing the sessions. Tell the group that you hope that you hope they will continue to meet even after the session ends. Encourage everyone to share their contact information (phone number, where they live) with each other to facilitate communication and stay in touch after the group is finished.
