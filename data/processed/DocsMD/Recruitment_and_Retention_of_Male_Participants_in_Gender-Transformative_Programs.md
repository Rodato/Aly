## Introduction

## Objectives of this brief

How to effectively recruit and retain male participants in gender-transformative programs remains an abiding question. Experiences from diverse settings reveal some  persistent  challenges  in  the  effective recruitment and retention of men and indicate  effective  strategies  and  ideas  that may  help mitigate these challenges. This brief is intended for practitioners in the field of male engagement in gender equality and summarizes programmatic lessons on recruitment  and  retention.  It  uses  examples from Plan International's Strengthening Health Outcomes for Women and Children (SHOW) program,  funded  by  Global  Affairs  Canada, as  well  as  from  other  program  experiences in  settings  as  diverse  as  Bangladesh,  Ghana, Haiti, Nigeria, Senegal, Rwanda,  and the United States.

The brief is organized as follows: The introduction  provides  a  background  on  Plan International's  SHOW  program,  the  motivation for engaging men  in gender-transformative programming,  and  common  barriers  to  and pitfalls in recruiting and retaining male participants in such programs. This is followed by a section on best practices and lessons learned on  recruiting  and  retaining  male  participants -including on targeting and scheduling, messaging and approach, relevance of content, and ongoing strategies - before concluding.

## Background to the SHOW program

SHOW is a multi-country, 4.5-year gender-transformative project aiming to reduce maternal and child mortality among vulnerable women and children in  underserved  regions  of  five  countries, namely,  Bangladesh,  Ghana,  Haiti,  Nigeria and  Senegal ('Global  Affairs  Canada  Online Recognition  Stories,'  n.d.).  SHOW  comprises a set of comprehensive gender-transformative approaches to engage men and boys as partners and  beneficiaries  of  gender  equality.  These include targeted engagement of male partners of  women  of  reproductive  age  in  groups,  of adolescent boys in groups, and of communitybased traditional and religious leaders; broad social  and  behavior  change  communication (SBCC) campaigns; and male  engagement initiatives by frontline health providers, including community-based health workers, to  create  a  broader  enabling  environment  for male engagement. Of these initiatives, Fathers Clubs promote men's equitable and nonviolent involvement as partners in maternal, newborn, and  child  health  (MNCH)  and  in  sexual  and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Fathers Clubs sessions allow men to reflect on what it means to be a man and a father in the context of these MNCH and SRHR health needs as well as in broader power relationships. Through this reflection,  men  become  aware  of  how  some gender expectations negatively affect their own lives and the lives of their partners and children.

## Why engage men?

## Men's engagement in MNCH and SRH means more than simply checking off a list of actions.

Plan International Canada defines 'male engagement' in MNCH/SRH as 'men taking an active role in  protecting  and  promoting the health and  wellbeing  of  their  partners  and  children' (Comrie-Thomson et al., 2015). This definition is premised on a vision of sustainable behavioral and relational change and more genderequitable relationships between male and female partners. It views male engagement as a broad concept rather than a list of actions or decisions in which men should participate in the MNCH/ SRH continuum of care. It views men's subjective experiences, motivations, relationships, and active participation, rather than specific actions, as indicative of engagement and sees a focus on men's agency and relationships as distinct from male participation or involvement, which can be understood to be more passive.

Men's sharing of care responsibilities benefits everyone . There is emerging evidence  on  the  positive  impact  of  involved fatherhood on children's physical and mental health, learning and development, and adult  relationships  (Levtov  et  al.,  2015).  A recent review of male engagement in MNCH programs highlighted the positive health outcomes for women, including better antenatal  care  attendance,  higher  rates  of skilled birth attendance, improved postpartum care,  and  improved  maternal  nutrition.  The Nurturing  Care  Framework  released  in  2018 at  the  World  Health  Assembly  emphasized the importance of engaging men beyond just helping  women  to  instead  playing  a  more central caregiving role. Operationalizing such an  objective  will  require  addressing  barriers that  stand  in  the  way  of  engaging  men  as more involved caregivers - especially gender norms that continue to deeply influence men's and  women's  roles  in  the  household  (Swan et  al.,  2019).  Men  themselves  benefit  from involvement in caregiving, with improvements in physical, mental, and sexual health outcomes and reductions in risk-taking behaviors (van der Gaag et al., 2019). In  Rwanda, a randomized controlled trial of Promundo's Program P revealed  a  range  of  positive effects  from gender-transformative  sessions  for  men  and their partners, including lower rates of partner violence,  improved  contraception  use,  and  a reduction  in  men's  dominance  in  household decision-making (Swan et al., 2019).

## Men want to be more involved and can be powerful agents of intergenerational change .

Many  men  want  to  have  stronger  emotional relationships  and  better  communication  with partners and children. They want to learn how to  discipline  their  children  or  resolve  conflict with  their  partners  in  nonviolent  ways  (Swan et al.,  2019). Data from the International Men and  Gender  Equality  Survey  (IMAGES)  show that  most  fathers  (ranging  from  61  percent  in Croatia to 77 percent in Chile) report that they would  work  less  if  it  meant  that  they  could spend more time with their children (Levtov et al., 2015). The SHOW project impacted a total of 15,105 fathers through 1,055 Fathers Clubs, with  preliminary  evidence  suggesting  these men learned and valued new nonviolent ways to support their partners and children. 1  Expectant and  new  fatherhood  is  an  especially  effective entry point to engaging men in gender equality

more  broadly,  as  this  is  usually  an  important transformative moment in parents' and fathers' lives  -  one  where  guidance,  knowledge,  and skills on navigating the changing circumstances may  be  welcome.  Fathers  who  are  actively involved  in  caring  for  and  raising  children  in equitable  ways  also  pave  the  way  for  future generations of gender-equitable individuals and caregivers.

Group-based strategies - like SHOW's Fathers Clubs - help lay the groundwork for lasting change . Interventions like the Fathers Clubs that have  been  implemented  in  the  Global  South typically  involve  small  groups  of  expecting  or new fathers meeting regularly with a facilitator in community spaces to engage in critical reflection on gender roles and on how these roles impact their  lives  and  the  lives  of  their  partners  and children. Working with groups of men allows the gradual  introduction  of  gender-transformative messages in sync with men's lives, allows men to learn from each other, and creates a critical mass of men who can take on leading change in the community. This process of raising critical consciousness is crucial in sparking lasting transformative change. 2

## Common barriers to recruitment and retention

Many programs report challenges in recruiting  and  retaining  male  participants . Specific challenges may vary greatly across local contexts,  program  objectives  and  design,  and participant  profiles.  However,  many  of  these challenges are the result of a few main barriers, like  social  norms  and  economic  factors.  This section  details  a  few  of  these  broad  barriers before  listing  a  few  specific  pitfalls  to  avoid when recruiting male participants.

Norms  that  do  not  ask  enough  of  fathers discourage  men  from  improving .  In  some communities  where  the  SHOW  program  was implemented  in  the  Global  South,  gender norms around fatherhood allow men to feel they already  live  up  to  the  expectations  of  'good fathers.' As a result, they may not feel the need to  participate  in  programming  that  promotes involved fatherhood, i.e., where fathers play a major, intimate, unchanging role in the care and upbringing of their  children  and  who  work  to ensure  their  children's  overall  well-being.  The general prevailing concepts of good fatherhood in such contexts may revolve around the roles of  'protector'  and  'provider'  without  much emphasis on fathers' role as 'nurturer.'  Since these  concepts  persist  community-wide,  and not  just  amongst  male  community  members, it  may  be  useful  to  complement group-based interventions with SBCC campaigns to expand the definition of fathers from only protectors and providers to include nurturing caregivers (Swan et  al.,  2019). In  the  SHOW  program,  Fathers Clubs orient men on this expanded definition of fatherhood  and  allow  reflection  opportunities for  men  to  take  on  the  role.  Strengthening SBCC campaigns to focus on fathers' nurturing role can help improve enrollment and retention by  sensitizing  family  members  and  gaining buy-in and trust in the expanded definition of fatherhood .

Men who do not see 'what's in it for them' may  not  want  to  participate  in  gendertransformative programming . Men may wonder  why  they  should  participate in a gender-transformative  program  that  appears to explicitly benefit their partners and children and  is  not  advertised  as  directly  or  clearly benefiting  them.  Especially  if  the  prevailing norms do not expect more of fathers beyond their traditional role of protector and provider, it  will  be  essential  to  work  to  change  these norms  and  widely  advertise  the  benefits  to men during recruitment of participants. These include  a  range  of  benefits  to  men  from greater  involvement  in  caregiving,  including improvements in physical, mental, and sexual health outcomes and reductions in risk-taking behaviors (van der Gaag et al., 2019)

See the earlier section 'Why engage men?' for more  evidence  on  how  gender-transformative sessions benefit men themselves.

Economic constraints can affect participants' ability to attend . In the Global South (where the SHOW program was implemented), challenges may arise from economic constraints related to participants'  conflicting  work  schedules  or  the broader  need  to  attend  to  their  daily  incomegenerating  activities,  particularly  in  rural  areas where  agriculture is a prevailing source of income. In  Bangladesh,  for  instance,  the  most common reason for participants missing Fathers Clubs  sessions  was  a  conflict  with  paid  work opportunities . Thus, gender-transformative programs may need to review the time-of-day and seasonality of Fathers Clubs meetings

to  encourage  regular  participation  and  offer make-up  sessions for sessions missed. The program could also consider combining gendertransformative activities with income-generating activities, like creating savings groups or selling artisanal products (with the objective of women's

## Box 1 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Unappealing spaces for sessions . In SHOW Bangladesh, a complaint many participants had was about not having snacks to eat or mats to sit on at the venue. Participants of SHOW Haiti also complained about not having snacks provided during the Fathers Clubs sessions . Where possible, simple, local solutions to improve amenities at the facilitation venue may help  retain  participants  and  are  recommended,  given  the  long  hours  participants  and facilitators spend there.

Not  considering  participants'  schedules  when  deciding  on  times . Some  participants in SHOW Bangladesh felt the sessions went on for too long . Depending on what constraints participants face, some flexibility of scheduling could be arranged. However, the quality of the work must not be compromised by skipping content. Sessions could be made shorter but more frequent, for instance.

See the 'Targeting and scheduling' section for more such strategies.

Not designing the program to appeal to participants . To be effective in recruitment, gender-transformative programs that target men must frame the work to appeal to their aspirations.

See the 'Messaging and approach' section for more on framing such work.

Ignoring the local context . Adapting programs to different cultural contexts also includes considering which community stakeholders to include in the design for maximizing reach and uptake of the program and thinking through logistics.

See the 'Relevance of content' section for more on contextually adapting curriculum.

Ignoring potential pushback from within the households . In the SHOW program in Ghana, members of Fathers Clubs were encountering pushback within their own households. To address this, a more specific intervention that was designed to also engage women was added in the program . Across the five SHOW countries, concurrent SBCC campaigns and community influencers integrated the importance of male engagement in their messaging, helping to build broader social support for men to engage effectively.

economic  empowerment),  where  the  group meets to counter this barrier (Swan et al., 2019).

See the 'Targeting and scheduling' section for more on accommodating the seasonality and timing of work.

## Recruitment and Retention: Best Practices and Lessons Learned

## Targeting and scheduling

Meet  men  where  they  are. Meeting  male participants where they are is both a metaphorical and literal need. To initiate transformative change,  it  is  important  to  meet  men  where they are emotionally and expect gradual transformation  in  attitudes  and  behaviors.  It  is also crucial to ensure that the physical venues for group sessions are not difficult for participants to get to. Feedback from the SHOW program in Bangladesh revealed that many men found the distance  to  the  group  sessions  overwhelming, citing  it  as  a  reason  for  not  attending  the sessions regularly. In the Bandebereho program in  Rwanda,  strategies  that  worked  to  address challenges  around  session  location  included using  transportation  incentives  for  participants and  meeting  and  deciding  as  a  group  on  the location of the group sessions .

Consider the timing and seasonality of work. Holding sessions in the evenings or on weekends tends to work better to accommodate men's and couples' schedules. In  Bangladesh, the  SHOW team avoided scheduling sessions during the harvesting season, when most men would have agricultural work to attend to . Even men who are not currently employed may not want to attend sessions during usual work hours (Swan et al., 2019).

Understand learner profiles early on. In the SHOW program in Ghana, migrant fathers were difficult to retain in the Fathers Clubs sessions, as  they  were  not  present  in  one  location  for long . Identifying suitable participants and understanding their specific circumstances may help reduce dropouts. Low literacy could  also  be  a  disincentive  for  members  to participate  in  the  program. For  instance,  in the SHOW program in Ghana, the low literacy of  participants  was  identified  by  facilitators as  a  barrier  to  their  attendance.  Thus,  the program was adapted to include illustrations and images to engage even those who were not literate .

See the brief 'Engaging Missing Populations in Gender-Transformative Programs' for more details  on  adapting  programs in low-literacy settings.

## Box 2 Role of Incentives

Whether to incentivize participation. Gender-transformative interventions consider financial incentives  to  compensate  participants  for  their  time  or  reimburse  expenses  incurred  in attending the session, like on transportation. However, such incentives can negatively impact programs'  long-term  sustainability,  and  some  programs  opt  for  non-monetary  incentives instead.  In  the  case  of  either  monetary  or  non-monetary  incentives,  it  is  imperative  that incentive structures do not perpetuate or further inequalities - for instance, only providing incentives to male participants may further undermine women's economic decision-making power in the household. Decisions about incentives should, thus, be made after considering potential implications on existing inequalities.

Non-monetary incentives and pitfalls. Given the impact that monetary incentives can have on budgets, many programs opt for alternatives. In  Bangladesh, SHOW participants were given awards for 'best fathers.' The staff also organized quiz competitions to gauge retention of the content . While acknowledging improvements in participants is important, and awards and events can encourage retention, program staff must be careful to not overly celebrate the smallest of changes, as this may impede genuine transformative change.

Perceptions of incentives in the community. In deciding whether to use incentives to recruit or retain participants, programs should gauge how the community views incentives. In Ghana, for instance, a SHOW facilitator expressed how the community distrusted him for expecting them to attend without payment:

[The members] think I am being paid and don't take it seriously. They think I'm being paid to say these things. They wonder why they should continue coming if they [as members] are also not being paid. 7

## Messaging and approach

Appeal  to  men's  aspirations  as  fathers  and partners . Understanding what men's ambitions are  for  themselves  and  for  their  involvement with their children and partners can help frame the message to appeal to their self-interest.

Use  a  strengths-based  approach .  Build  on what men and fathers already know. A focus on

practical,  active  lessons  that  accommodate  a diversity of men and learning styles works better to encourage men to continue participating in the program.

Frame gender equality as not just a women's issue . SHOW  staff  in  Ghana  found  that  men initially thought the program was about maternal health and were disinclined to attend. After the first session, men realized it was also

about issues that affected their lives - such as their involvement in their partner's pregnancies and  the  potential  related  benefits  such  as greater relationship satisfaction and better health outcomes for their children and partners - and attendance improved .

Introduce power  and  gender  gradually . Starting  with  talking  about  relationships  and about men and women's lives generally before moving on to more difficult  and  contentious topics like power and gender can help prevent disengagement and dropouts. Issues of power and  gender  inequality  are  complex  and  can ignite  debate  or  make  men  feel  defensive. Introducing topics that male participants can relate  to  in  their  own  lives  in  nonjudgmental ways can be a more effective way to start the process of change.

Clarify that participants are not being punished .  It  is  important  to  let  participants know  that  they  have  not  been  targeted  for 'bad' behaviors. Clarifying what the program objectives are will help minimize any feelings of stigma  associated  with  participating.  This  also entails  recruiting  a  diversity  of  men,  including men who already embody positive masculinities and demonstrate caring, involved, and nonviolent fatherhood. Recruiting men who already demonstrate healthy masculinities will help provide role models to other participants and may prevent stigmatization in the community that the group is for 'bad' men or fathers.

## Box 3 Using Community-Based Solutions to Improve Retention: A Mini Case Study

A partner of Promundo shared the following brief case study of how, during an adaptation of Program P, they used a participatory approach to update the messaging to appeal to their target audience - Nepalese and Bhutanese fathers in Pennsylvania, United States and improved recruitment and retention.

I really think the shift had to do with integrating fun activities that were chosen by the community members. Once we got a few men committed to the second cohort, we had them choose activities that they wanted to do the first time we met. They chose playing cards, playing soccer, watching World Cup matches (it was perfect timing that the World Cup was going on when we started the group), playing karom [a Nepali game], and they eventually asked if we could go on field trips. Once we spent a few of the sessions doing the fun activities, we used the field trips as incentives for people who kept up with group attendance. The few community members that joined early on ended up inviting friends and other community members, so the group was able to grow. By the time we started the curriculum, the participants had already formed relationships , which seemed to make it easier for them to be open in the group. Getting to know each other also helped because they would call each other and give reminders about the group. We met for two hours each session and spent the first 30 minutes doing an activity;

usually it was playing cards or a game. The other thing that made a big difference was having a van driver that picked people up in the community. We didn't need this for the first round because we were still in our old office within the community, but since [moving], we have been providing transportation for groups. 8

The partner organization used creative 'crowd-sourced' ideas to tweak their approach and messaging, allowing relationships to form within the group, using incentives for participation, and helping members overcome a real barrier - in this case, transportation.

## Relevance of content

Include participants  and  communities  in the design stage .  Participation of the target community  early  in  the  program  -  through formative research in the form of focus group discussions and in-depth interviews - can help ensure  that  the  content  and  implementation are relevant to the lives of the people who will go through the curriculum.

Planning enough time for contextual adaptation  is  particularly  important  for

## Box 4

## Involving the Community and Managing Backlash

Backlash in the community as a deterrent . In Bangladesh, facilitators implementing the Changemaker Families curriculum noted that 'backbiting' or criticism in the community was a major reason that men and women stopped coming to the sessions. Similarly, a cooking competition did not succeed - unlike other events in the program - because of its public nature: Participants felt they could not change their behavior in public and feared backlash.

Participants  value  programs  despite  such  backlash . Testimonies  from  participants  in SHOW's Fathers Clubs in Ghana and Nigeria and in Program P in Rwanda indicate that many men consider the value from the program enough to resist the backlash.

international  programs .  The  importance  of contextual adaption of curricula is especially important  for  programs  like  SHOW  that  are implemented  across  multiple  countries  and very diverse settings. The formative research and community involvement can help facilitators come up with contextually relevant scenarios and examples in the group activities to prevent participants from becoming disengaged due to finding the material irrelevant, boring, or imposed by 'outsiders.' It is also important to allocate sufficient time in the work plan for this process of adaptation.

I was there, and my wife was pregnant and couldn't carry the child to the clinic. I did it out of love and I felt very good. People could say I am bewitched or stupid. But, if someone can bewitch you to empower yourself and your family, what's wrong with that?

-Young father in Rwanda, 2014 (Doyle et al., 2018)

Nothing can make me change [these] positive changes I am enjoying now; even if I experience stigma outside, immediately [when] I enter my home, I forget everything.

-Fathers Clubs member in Nigeria, 2018 (Plan International, 2020)

Initially some friends of mine did not understand the reason for my change [and they tried] to mock me. But I rather explained to them and they now understand the reason for the change, hence their support.

-Fathers Clubs member in Ghana, 2018 (Plan International, 2020)

Engaging the community as an opportunity .  Where governments, community leaders, and influential stakeholders have been engaged in programming, recruitment and retention rates are impressive. In the MenCare+ program in Rwanda - which included an adaptation of  Program  P  in  addition  to  other  programmatic  components  -  partnerships  with  the government and the involvement of respected community leaders, in addition to other contextual factors, helped keep attrition rates low (Doyle et al., 2014) .

Possible pros and cons of involving community and religious leaders . The involvement of religious leaders in SHOW Nigeria meant high uptake of the Fathers Clubs program in the community and success in recruitment. In gender-transformative programs generally, the advantages of greater acceptance and uptake in the community as a result of engaging faith leaders may also come with some pitfalls. In Nigeria, a context where conservative norms were prevalent, religious leaders often intervened to frame messages in the curriculum in ways that aligned with religious texts, leading to an approach that sometimes was more genderaccommodating  than  gender-transformative,  where  the  former  approach  acknowledges gender  differences  and  inequalities  while  working  around  them,  and  the  latter  approach seeks to change and transform gender relations to promote equality.

See the brief 'Engaging Religious Leaders in MNCH, SRHR, and Gender Equality: Field Experiences from the SHOW Project in Sokoto, Nigeria' for more information on effective strategies to mitigate such challenges.

## Ongoing strategies

Use  community  participation  and  mobilization beyond  the  sessions . Participants can  be encouraged to do voluntary community service to build strong connections in the community beyond their own cohort. Couples and households who are open and willing to do so can share their stories of transformative change at town halls or other community events.

See the preceding 'Involving the Community and Managing Backlash' box for more applications.

Recruit  through  the  most  suitable  means of communication .  Depending on the target audience,  the  ideal  channels  of  recruitment differ greatly: for example, leaflets and posters  at  the  community  center,  follow-ups over the phone, communicating via platforms like  WhatsApp,  or  word  of  mouth  through community members or leaders.

Plan for 'family days.' Many men and women appreciate  the  opportunity  to  participate  in programs as couples or families. Creating spaces for togetherness in the program and scheduling sessions  for  the  family  where  the  household members can practice positive behaviors, envision  an  equitable  future  together,  or  plan and  make  a  budget  could  be  a  powerful  way to  engage  the  entire  family  and  help  link  the program messages to participants' own lives.

## Engage through 'homework' and discussions .

In Bangladesh, SHOW participants appreciated the  thought-provoking  discussions  that  would result from reviewing homework in a group. They cited these discussions and role-play activities as reasons for their regular attendance .

Equip facilitators with resources during home visits . Individual home visits can be an effective mode of ensuring  retention.  However,  facilitators need to feel equipped to carry these visits out. In Bangladesh, community health workers and SHOW staff  felt  supplementary  materials  like visit  protocols  and  communications  materials would make it easier to engage the community in  improving  MNCH  and  SRH  outcomes  and mainstream the gender-transformative messages of the program .

Clarify participation eligibility and objectives . In Ghana, entire communities would  sometimes  turn  up  for  Fathers  Clubs sessions. While the program staff did not want to  alienate  the  families  of  the  participants,  it was  understandably  a  challenge .  Using  the first session as an introduction to the program objectives and clarifying the intended audience may help address such potential risks to dropout from overcrowded sessions.

## Conclusion

Experiences of gender-transformative programming from diverse settings reveal that  paying  attention  to  the  diversity  in  men's aspirations, expectations, and constraints is key, as is involving influential community stakeholders to minimize the impact of stigma and backlash. In  the  experience  of  the  SHOW  program,  the Fathers  Clubs  curricula  did  not  directly  address social stigma and community backlash. However, the Fathers Clubs members advocated for positive masculinities  in  their  families  and  communities, leading  to  a  gradual  evolution  of  norms  that reduced stigma against men who participated in the program. The complementary SBCC activities and  engagement  of  community  leaders  and health workers who integrated male-engagement messaging  in  their  work  also  helped  to  create an  environment  conducive  for  men  to  begin engaging  more  meaningfully  in transforming gender relations in their communities.
