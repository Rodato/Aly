## PREFACE

The Creating Peace initiative presented here is a rare example of an experience from the Global South informing and inspiring approaches in the Global North. Although there is much that we can learn from experiences outside the US - particularly from the Global South - in terms of mental health, public health, youth development, and community violence prevention, in practice, we seldom look outside our borders for solutions.

Creating Peace is informed by and builds on work in conflict-affected areas, such as those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where Equimundo has partnered for many years. This work has nurtured our understanding of how violence, oppression, and structural inequities create ongoing trauma, close down discussions, create vulnerabilities, and sometimes lead to cycles of violence. The approach emerged as a critique of the individualistic focus of some violence prevention efforts. Specifically, our approaches to supporting young people who have witnessed or experienced violence often focus on providing support for the individual young person.

We recognize that individually focused services are needed - psychosocial support, mental health treatment, and counseling show measurable benefits to individuals who have experienced trauma related to experiencing or witnessing violence, whether in the home or in public spaces. But rebuilding and healing from experiences of violence is also a collective effort. While trauma is individually experienced and its impact can reverberate over an individual's life, it is also experienced collectively.

Thus, Creating Peace emerged as a way to support couples, and individual men and women, affected by decades of conflict in the DRC. Led by the Congolese organization the Living Peace Institute, Creating Peace involves these men and women building solidarity amongst themselves to respond to trauma and violence experienced as individuals. The approach is informed by evidence-based psychological and psychotherapeutic approaches that are rooted in community action, collective responses, solidarity, and healing justice.

The Creating Peace approach seeks to support individual young people not only in building their skills and knowledge to cope with trauma and violence in their lives, but also in building a sense of community with other young people to move beyond trauma to resilience, recovery, community, and activism.

It is also rooted in an understanding of how gender norms - ideas about what we expect from boys and girls - are taught and how gender inequities affect trauma recovery. This includes how girls may be encouraged to put up with certain forms of violence from boys and assume such violence is normal, or how boys may be encouraged to 'play through the pain' and 'never let them see you sweat.' In the process, girls may internalize trauma into self-harm, silence, or tolerating violence, while boys may externalize trauma into aggression, anger, or violence against others. These gender norms and inequities also create unsafe environments for trans and

nonbinary folks, whose identities and bodies are often invalidated and attacked by individuals and systems.

Creating Peace is anchored in the idea that young people - particularly those from low-income and historically disadvantaged neighborhoods - play a critical role in demanding change. The curriculum presumes that young people are never only victims of trauma; they are agents of change, capable of and uniquely positioned to be part of solutions. Indeed, in the US, young people of color who have witnessed and experienced disproportionate levels of violence in their communities are best positioned to contribute to solutions and community transformation. That doesn't mean the solution is solely up to them. It means that teachers, parents, school boards, city officials, coaches, youth workers, lawmakers, and police must listen to the young people most affected by violence and trauma to bring about the structural and political changes necessary to reduce violence and the historical inequities that often drive violence of all kinds.

Creating Peace empowers young people to take the lead in violence prevention, community activism, and racial and gender justice by being able to identify the traumas they have experienced and join other young people who, like themselves, seek to change the underlying conditions that lead to violence and trauma in the first place. This curriculum has been co-created with input from multiple youth and adult leaders in the Pittsburgh region while listening to and learning from the experiences of the Equimundo and Living Peace teams. The development of Creating Peace has involved continuous iteration and growth as we learn from each other about building on youth and community strengths, while simultaneously navigating multiple challenges and horrific inequities laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Creating Peace curriculum! Through this gender-transformative methodology, we aim to foster more equitable gender norms, promote racial justice, and ultimately reduce violence among young people in our communities. The Creating Peace lessons are primarily designed for high school-age youth of all genders, ranging from the ages 14 to 19; however, the curriculum could be adapted for groups of younger or older audiences. Facilitators and program implementers should be mindful of the program's goals at all stages of the project cycle - including preparation, implementation, and evaluation.

Grounded in an intersectional feminist approach, Creating Peace recognizes that systems of power impact those most marginalized in society. This curriculum focuses on the relationships among gender inequity ( attitudes and behaviors that degrade women and promote 'traditional masculinity' ), racial injustice, and violence perpetration. Social categories of class, race, sexual orientation, ability, and gender are complexly interwoven, and Creating Peace is one of the few community-driven approaches to violence to also integrate how gender socialization ( what it means to be a man, woman, or nonbinary person ) and unequal power dynamics contribute to violence.

## GOALS OF CREATING PEACE

- Establish a safe space to  address and heal from experiences involving violence 1
- Promote gender equity , positive relationship norms, and nonviolent norms 2
- Practice positive relationship-building and bystander skills to promote equality within peer groups 3
- Build leadership skills to address racial and gender injustice in nonviolent ways 4
- Engage in community-based activism to offer preventative methods against gendered, racist, and other forms of discrimination 5

Additionally, this curriculum uses trauma-informed approaches that recognize the impact of violence exposure on youth violence perpetration. This community-based model of programming, involving diverse community collaborators (including leaders, educators, community health professionals, and law enforcement officers), is a rare but powerful methodology for sustainable holistic change toward nonviolence. Because violence perpetration often emerges in multiple aspects of young people's lives, violence prevention requires addressing those inequitable attitudes and behaviors, as well as acknowledging the environment in which young people live, learn, and play.

With all of these elements and intersections in mind, the theory of change for this curriculum states that IF the following combination of intervention components and skill-building is implemented, THEN there will be a decrease in violence perpetration among the target population.

## INTERVENTION COMPONENTS AND SKILL-BUILDING

## Establish trauma-informed space

Safe space to reflect on experiences of violence and bias-based discrimination , question normalcy of violence, find personal voice

## Promote gender-equitable and positive relationship norms and nonviolent attitudes

Activities promote gender equity and positive, nonviolent definitions of masculinity/femininity

## Critically examine structural forces that perpetuate racial and gender injustice

Use arts-based strategies and media literacy activities to challenge social norms and messages about race and gender

## Practice mutual support, accountability, and positive bystander behaviors

Practice ways to intervene safely when seeing harmful behaviors, help peers who were harmed

## Nurture youth leadership skills

Practice communication, develop presentations (using art, photos, writing from sessions)

We encourage you to read through the curriculum in its entirety to fully grasp the core components and some steps that can be taken before its implementation to maximize the impact of the program. Enjoy!

Increased sense of safety, connection, and personal agency

Increased genderequitable attitudes and positive relationship norms

Increased intentions to support and intervene as positive bystanders with peers

Increased self-efficacy to enact community change

## INTENDED OUTCOMES

Increased connectedness and community cohesion

Increased community action and activism to address challenges youth face in their lives

Safer and less violent communities where youth can grow and prosper

## FACILITATOR'S GUIDE

## THE ROLE OF THE FACILITATOR

The key to facilitating is seeing yourself as a facilitator, not a teacher. Your role is to ask questions to better understand where young people are coming from and guide them in group reflections to critically look at harmful norms around gender and race, as well as the history of gender and racial justice, and to build youth leadership skills. You do not have to be a gender equity expert and do not need to have all the answers. Rather, your role as the facilitator is to create an open and respectful environment in which young people can feel comfortable sharing and learning from each other in a safe space.

## Embracing a Trauma-Sensitive Approach

Creating Peace specifically deals with themes that can trigger negative memories and experiences for young people. As you go through your sessions, pay attention to the young people's comfort level. In some cases, you may need to refer individuals to professional services or a community partner with extensive psychosocial and traumafocused support. (Make sure that for each setting, you have a referral system and pathway for connecting them to this support.) As facilitators, you should be trained in indicators for referral to specialized psychological support. In collaboration with clinical supervisors, a participant may be referred to specialized support.

It is important to be aware of the practical realities of the group members' lives and understand that they may face challenges or dangers when trying to make changes. Creating Peace emphasizes trauma-sensitive facilitation during sessions. The following box lists the principles to integrate into your program design and implementation.

When using the Creating Peace curriculum, it is critical to always keep the young people's experiences, both past and present, at the forefront of your implementation. From the way you design and adapt the curriculum to the setting of your sessions to the language you use during facilitation, be mindful of how these can impact the young people. The trauma-sensitive approach to training and facilitation prioritizes the following principles:

- Safety
- Trustworthiness &amp; transparency
- Peer support
- Empowerment, voice, &amp; choice
- Collaboration
- Cultural, historical, &amp; gender awareness lens

TRAUMASENSITIVE FACILITATION PRINCIPLES

Changing behaviors and coping responses for dealing with distress and negative memories and experiences is a slow, individualized process. Participating in these activities will not necessarily lead to an immediate transformation in young people's lives and relationships. However, the sessions encourage young people to reflect on their current beliefs and behaviors and make changes as they see beneficial. We hope they will begin to experience the positive effects of exchange, sharing, and social belonging as positive and constructive responses in counteracting painful and negative experiences. This is a big step toward promoting personal and collective change.

Given the sensitivity of the session topics, young people could bring up personal traumatic experiences, such as the use of violence, sexual trauma, or other forms of abuse. Given facilitators' and staff's mandatory reporting requirements (that is, requirements to report abuse, sexual assault, risk for harm, and so forth when the participant is a minor), it is important to remind young people at the beginning of each session that they are welcome to leave the room if they feel uncomfortable; they are not required to share any sensitive information; and for those under 18, you (the facilitator) are required to involve other adult authorities should a young person disclose instances of abuse to keep them safe. This should also be repeated at the beginning of particularly sensitive activities.

Remind young people of the resources that are available to them and that you are available after the session to talk further. Refer young people to service providers with whom they can discuss any issues they may be having. Be prepared to share resources with all young people at the end of each session, and continuously remind young people in the groups about those resources and how to access them. A sample can be found in Annex A, which includes online and in-person resources specific to the greater Pittsburgh area.

## Prioritizing Young People's Engagement

As we've indicated, the facilitator's role is to do just that - facilitate a conversation. Although they can often be seen as teachers or experts, facilitators should guide the sequence of activities and moderate the young people's discussions.

## Ask Questions That Promote Dialogue

See your group as a process. Ask 'process questions,' or questions that cause young people to reflect more. These are unbiased questions that cannot be answered with a 'yes' or 'no.' See the following box for additional tips:

| YES, dothis!                                                                                                                             | NO, don't dothat!                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Askprocessquestions 'What do you think about using violence to retaliate after experiencing violence? What would be the result of this?' | Don't ask questionsthatcanbeanswered with a 'yes' or 'no' Example: 'Will you use violence as a form of retaliation?' |

| YES, dothis!                                                                                                                                                             | NO, don't dothat!                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Besimple Ask, 'When?' 'Where?' 'What?' 'How?' 'Who?' 'Why?' You should continue with a full sentence: 'What were you thinking whenthat happened? Whydoyouthink that is?' | Don't ask a leading or biased question Example: 'To be a better person, why would you learn to control your emotions?'                                                   |
| Beunbiased Exclude your ownfeelings and values from the questions, and instead guide them in identifying problems and solutions.                                         | Don't ask too manyquestions atonce For young people to fully comprehend and answer your prompt, limit yourself to one or two at a time, with probes andfollow-ups ready. |

## GENERAL TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL FACILITATION

The following are useful tips to help you lead group sessions, creating and encouraging a respectful environment in which young people feel comfortable sharing their opinions and experiences, as well as listening to - and learning from - others.

| Remember the group agreements:   | Askyoungpeopletodecideonasetofgroupagreementsandremindthem of those agreements throughout the sessions. Important group agreements involve listening to andshowingrespect for others (e.g., not talking whenothers are speaking, making rude comments, or talking onthe phone), confidentiality, andparticipation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Donotjudge                       | Remember, you are here to facilitate discussion and reflection. Your role is not to teach or punish anyone. Be friendly and create rapport with the young people. Be aware of your ownposition of power, avoiding judgmental and authoritarian attitudes. Never impose your feelings or opinions on the group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Promote inclusion                | Ensure that all the young people have the opportunity to speak. Becareful not to let onepersondominate the conversation or makeotherpeople feel that they cannot share their ownopinions. Although silencescanbeawkwardinagroup setting, be patient anddon't answer the question yourself without hearing from the young people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Address youngpeople's concerns   | The group meetings can serve as an important opportunity for young people to receive help and advice. As a facilitator, it is important that you validate the concerns that people have, but you can also engage the larger group in helping to propose solutions to the problems individuals are facing. Ask the group, 'Howdoyouthink this problem could be solved?' or 'Has anyone faced a similar situation? Whatdid you do?' However, it is important that you do not attempt to solve everyone's problems during facilitation - this can feel like targeting the individual. |

| Knowanduse referral services    | Someproblemsthatyoungpeoplearefacing mayrequire outside support. In addition, someyoungpeoplemayprefertodiscuss a particular topic, obtain information, or seek support outside of a group setting.Insomecases,theymay need attention from a specialized service provider. Asafacilitator, you should be knowledgeable about places whereyoucanrefer young people, if needed. If you are not a professionally trained mental health provider, it is important that you acknowledge your boundaries in providing assistance to young people.                                                                               |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manageconflicts respectfully    | If a conflict arises amongthe group, or if a participant shares a discriminatory view, remind the young people of the group agreements. Encourage other membersto help mediate the situation. Ask the group what they think about the question raised or howthey would suggest handling the problem. Whennecessary, you can offer brief responses to questions and correct misinformation. There maybecases where you will need to refer to the session's key messages and take a stance on an important lesson (e.g., interpersonal violence is wrong and should be avoided; consent is important in all relationships). |
| Appreciate honestyand openness  | Encourage young people to be honest and open. They should not be afraid to discuss sensitive issues for fear of ridicule from their peers. Thank the group membersfor sharing their personal stories. Never force anyone to participate in the activities. Instead, try to create an environment in which the young people feel comfortable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Promote movementand interaction | Include as muchphysical movement as possible so that young people remain active, alert, and interested. Weencourage you to use short energizers in between activities to keep the young people engaged in the topics you are discussing. Someexamples can be found in Annex Bof this curriculum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Manage your time                | Keep track of time; do not spend more than three hours on a given session. The sessions in this curriculum are structured to take about two hours each, with short breaks. Keep in mind young people's attention spans and schedules. Use energizers to help transition between activities and keep young people motivated and alert.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Askfor feedback                 | Usethe'check-out' to receive regular feedback from young people:What dothey like anddislike? Whatis working or not working? Usetheir input to improve the sessions. Donotdivert from the planned activities, but use feedback to improve howsessions are run (for example, by including moreenergizers).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Berespectful in presence        | Try to be as respectful as possible in your appearance andnonverbal andverbal presentation. This includes the wayyoudress(avoiding clothes that distract) andaddressyoungpeople(workonrememberingtheyoungpeople'snames-a simple namegamecanhelpinthat).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Becareful of topicsthatmay retraumatize                  | Given the sensitivity of the session topics, young people could bring uppersonal traumatic experiences, such as the use of violence, sexual trauma, or other forms of abuse. Remindthemoftheresources that are availabletothemand that you are available after the session to talk further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Keep discussions fromstraying too farfromthe keymessages | One of the main facilitator tools you can use is the 'bank,' also known as the 'parking lot.' While all discussions are welcomed, if a participant brings up a topic that cannot be addressed within the time allotted, write it on a flipchart paper called the 'bank' or 'parking lot.' It is important to revisit these topics at another time. However, if the topic is completely unrelated to Creating Peace, say something like, 'That's a great comment. Wedon't have time to address that right now, but let's talk more about it after the session!' |

## NAVIGATING SITUATIONS WITH GRACE AND EMPATHY

Regardless of how much experience you have with facilitating or teaching, there will inevitably be a few situations during Creating Peace that will surprise you. Here are a few principles to keep in your mind as you work your way through the curriculum.

| Begender- affirming         | This means that you should meet young people where they are and support their owngender expression and identity. You mayhave trans individuals or nonbinary young people whodonotadhere to traditional gender norms you're familiar with. That is okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Beopento diversity          | It is important for young people to feel like they are in an open and trusted space to talk about their lived experiences. As a facilitator, you should model open, nonjudgmental attitudes, especially as they pertain to sexual activity and diverse orientations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Emphasize facts             | Discussions can be lively and debates should happen, but at the end of the day, the facilitator's role is to hold facts to be true. The conversation should be led by young people but moderated by the facilitator with a clear summaryof the facts. This will avoid young people walking away with incorrect information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Empathize but don't project | Although it is important for you to facilitate the discussion, you should balance your input and avoid being a participant yourself. As you facilitate the conversation, be sure not to project your ownopinions or experiences that maynot be shared by everyone. At the end of the day, weare hoping that the young people have an opportunity to reflect and critically think about these issues. Weshouldn't assume that just because you're from thesame neighborhood, you've had the sameexperience. Everyone's journey is different, and as a facilitator, you should promote inclusion. |
| Model vulnerability         | As you go through the sessions, be sure to encourage vulnerability amongthe students. One way to do this is to tell your story - the good and the bad - and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

let the younger generation know they aren't by themselves. This also builds trustworthiness and gives you legitimacy as an adult facilitator. It is a balance, though - we need to be mindful of leaving space for the young people to answer and discuss.

## ADAPTING TO A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Depending on the context of your Creating Peace program, you may use an in-person, virtual, or hybrid model. We have included some best practices for online facilitation, should your program be hybrid or fully virtual. Additionally, Annex E includes selected sessions that have been adapted for virtual use. If you haven't previously facilitated online sessions, it might take a couple of tries to get into the swing of things - and that's okay. By using the following tips, as well as the adapted session plans, you should be well on your way to making the program as fun and engaging as it would be in person. The full article containing these best practices and more can be found in the Stanford Social Innovation Review. 1

## ENSURE DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY IS ACCESSIBLE AND INCLUSIVE

Shifting content online can increase barriers to entry for some young people, particularly those from underserved or under-resourced populations. One way to select the best delivery mechanism is by distributing a survey before the session to assess what type of technology or devices your audience has access to (e.g., computers, smart or feature phones) and whether their data or internet connection is strong enough for a video call. Some of Equimundo's partners recommend selecting platforms that are compatible with phones and that do not sap large amounts of data. It may be necessary to read the agenda and describe visual content to ensure those phoning in are not left out, while closed captioning services can automate transcription.

Young people may vary in their familiarity with digital tools, so start by walking young people through the ways they can engage (e.g., chat box, emojis, muting and unmuting the microphone) to ensure that all young people feel prepared to engage. (For more information on virtual adaptation, see Annex E.)

## BUILD TRUST AND COMMUNITY WITH THE GROUP

The ability to build trust and community with the group is a key determinant of success for training programs on sensitive topics, both remote and in person, since success often depends upon young people's openness and trust. Shifting to virtual engagement on personal subjects like gender, race, power, and violence requires additional efforts to establish trust in a group. We advise creating 'brave zones' where young people can be engaged but not defensive, as well as establishing group norms of 'taking space and giving space' as early as possible. When hosting trainings online, another prerequisite for building trust in the group is ensuring privacy and confidence for young people and

facilitators. Allowing young people to define community guidelines at the beginning of the sessions can be one way to navigate this, granting them agency to set boundaries from the outset.

Providing multiple ways for young people to engage - from speaking to typing in the chat box to giving feedback via anonymous forums - enables attendees to share in the way that is most comfortable for them. As with in-person engagement, individuals who are systemically marginalized and oppressed tend to participate less frequently, and technology can amplify inequities if not mitigated thoughtfully. For example, the same issues and inequities that occur in person are still factors online. It is the facilitator's job to be mindful of such dynamics within the group and correct for them when structuring the session. (For more information on group agreements, see Session 1.)

## UNDERSTAND THE ETHICS OF REMOTE FACILITATION AND DISCLOSURE

Leading remote trainings can mean reaching people in different geographic areas, which can create both opportunities and risks. Make sure you research mandatory reporting requirements in your community and the communities the young people are in to inform disclosure and safeguarding before your session. (For more information on a trauma-sensitive approach and reporting, see the earlier 'Embracing a TraumaSensitive Approach' subsection.)

## USE PARTICIPANT-DRIVEN CONTENT DESIGN

Keeping young people at the center of the design process is essential for remote training programs and workshops on sensitive topics, and this will help to safeguard against risks to young people. The audience should also have opportunities to voice any questions or concerns - and, ultimately, shape decisions and the design of the program itself. Additionally, you should ensure trained local experts facilitate sessions to more effectively tackle difficult subjects. For example, in developing the Portal for Gender Equality in Schools (PEGE) in Brazil (an online platform for distance learning for public school educators), Equimundo learned that involving local teachers in designing educational activities was essential to the sustainability of school-based interventions. When programs are designed and performed by external professionals, they often end when the 'outsiders' leave and may overlook issues that would be obvious to those engaged with the content daily. The same could be true at the end of a remote program designed and delivered by outside organizations. (For more information on formative research, see Annex D.)

## DEVELOP FEEDBACK LOOPS FOR EVALUATION AND ITERATION

Part of keeping young people at the center of the programmatic design process on sensitive topics is providing them with mechanisms for evaluation both during and after the session. Throughout the program, elicit verbal or written feedback from young people to gauge the group's mood, reactions, and desired pace. Post-engagement feedback is vital to determine which activities and content resonated most (and

least) with the young people. It may be helpful to include a pre-program and postprogram survey to measure the impact and perception shifts among young people as a result of the program. Participant feedback is crucial in our quest to craft impactful remote engagement on sensitive topics: While we have an exciting opportunity to innovate on delivery, the types and effectiveness of technology for promoting shifts in power dynamics is an important area for future research. (For more information on monitoring and evaluation, see Annex D.)

## RUNNING EACH SESSION

As mentioned in the previous section, your implementation may be in person, virtual, or hybrid. The following guidelines for running each session should be adapted to your model of implementation. Please remember to refer to our supplemental Annex E for virtually adapted sessions as well. Virtual sessions may take more preparation than inperson ones to familiarize yourself with the platforms and uses of technology.

## PREPARATION

| Readthrough the sessions                              | Asafacilitator, you mustknowwhatisinvolved in the session andnotbereading through it for the first time while facilitating. Before the first session, you should read through the entire curriculum. Additionally, you should prepare about 30to 45 minutes the day before each session; any prep should begin by reading through the upcoming session in its entirety. You can also plan additional energizers, which can help young people to relax, have fun, maintain concentration, andbecohesive as a group. Importantly, you should consider if any changes will need to be madeif the session will be virtual (or in person).   |

| Comewith all necessary materials                      | There are preparation instructions for each activity, which will take time to complete before the session begins. Be sure to print worksheets and bring any needed materials to the session. Werecommendoffering young people sometype of refreshment during the session, a step that tends to be highly valued by young people and helps them stay in the group process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Prepare the space                                     | Whenpreparing the space, always arrange chairs in a circle for all sessions unless otherwise noted. In virtual settings, be sure you are familiar with the breakout roomfunctions on the platform you are using.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Hosta30-minute briefing session onthedayofthe session | For projects with multiple facilitators, our team has found it helpful for the group to discuss the day's session. Set any collective expectations of facilitators (e.g., keeping the camera on is a must for virtual sessions), and ask any clarifying questions on the content or methodology:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## FACILITATION

| Checkin at the beginning of each session                | It is important to begin each session by warmly welcoming the group back and checking in. Acheck-in provides time for young people to share any thoughts, personal experiences, and comments they had based on the discussion from the last session. Spend several minutes checking in per person before beginning the day's session. This is also a good time for young people to fill in the attendance sheet.                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Beflexible, be creative,and contextualize activities    | If the topics and examples presented in these activities comeacross as too abstract or removed from your realities as facilitators, you can add in examples from your daily lives and experiences. This will help young people to be emotionally involved and identify more closely with the material. Sharing personal experiences also helps to model the behavior you want from the young people in your group. Be careful not to stray too far from the curriculum, as this can prevent you from reaching the sessions' objectives. |
| Runicebreakers andenergizers                            | Icebreakers are short activities that help young people to build trust in the group, usually in a lighthearted way. They are a great way to open a session, allowing young people to move around, share, and become comfortable with one another. They are most helpful whenthe group appears to have low energy, lose interest, or not be responding to the activity. These help to change the routine, get people in motion, and relieve fatigue and boredom.                                                                         |
| Keepgroup discussions open-endedand betweenyoung people | Group discussions can be the most important part of each activity. These discussions are opportunities for young people to reflect on what they've been doing, discuss with one another someof their thoughts, and think critically about howto see these changes in their ownlives. It is important for facilitators to makesure that conversations remain open, judgment-free, and comfortable. Try and get the group to talk to one another, rather than having one-on-one conversations with whoever is leading the facilitation.   |

- Do you feel comfortable leading [x portion, activity z]?
- What would be a good stopping point for a break during the session?
- Realistically, how many activities do you think you can complete in this two hours?
- What is the minimum number of young people you need for a particular session to go well?
- How can you ensure all facilitators are equipped with the proper language on the purpose and intent of Creating Peace?

## WRAP-UP

| Reiterate key messages   | It is important to read aloud and emphasize the key takeaways from each activity. This will ensure that each participant walks away with a similar understanding of the activity's key messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Askforone word           | End each day with a one-word check-out from young people on howthey are feeling or something they learned that stuck with them (e.g., 'motivated,' 'energized,' or 'teamwork'). Use this time to reflect on the main conclusions of the day, announce the next activities, see what can be improved or what worked well, and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Usegrounding techniques  | Conversations about gender, race, class, and violence can be hard to leave behind in the session. For this reason, werecommendusing 'grounding techniques' (or forms of physical and verbal processing) to help end Creating Peace sessions. These strategies can help ensure that young people can process appropriately rather than allowing the session content to negatively affect them between groups (see examples in the following box).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| GROUNDING TECHNIQUES     | You mayfind that your group prefers one technique or another. It is perfectly acceptable to mix and match these or develop newpersonalized strategies. These techniques should be explained as strategies that young people can use in their ownlives whenthey are feeling overwhelmed or overstimulated. Somerequire movement, but somecanbedonewhile sitting quietly. • Have young people focus on their breathing. Ask them to breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, breathe out for a count of four, and hold for another count of four. As they do, they mayfind it helpful to trace or visualize a square shape. • Ask young people to press their feet firmly into the ground. See if they can imagine each toe pressing into the ground, moving from their big toe outward. Then have them press their heels into the ground. Ask young people to rest their palms on their knees and close their eyes. What do they notice about howtheir body feels? • Have young people write or draw about the session quietly for five to ten minutes. Tell them they are allowed to write/draw whatever they want without fear of judgment. Young people can take their writing/ drawing with them, throw it away, or share it with a peer or facilitator |

- Have young people sit in a circle. As a facilitator, share something that you appreciated about them during this session. It might be that they were willing to share, they corrected their behavior, they were enthusiastic, they supported a friend, they listened well, etc.
- Have a dance party! Let young people pick one song they want to dance, move, or sing to. This can help release some of the adrenaline associated with feeling tense.
- Ask young people to find five objects in the room of a certain color, shape, texture, or size. Alternatively, ask young people to find an object of each color of the rainbow in the room.
- Have young people shout the emotion they are feeling after you count to three. Allow them the opportunity to express these emotions honestly, even if they don't feel relevant.
- Ask young people to create an affirmation statement for themselves with two things that are true or they like about themselves. An example statement might be: 'My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. I am a good friend and a helpful sister.'
- Let young people stretch in ways that feel good and natural to them, and encourage them to focus on their breathing while they do so.

## Debrief Session for Facilitators

Host a 15- to 20-minute debriefing session

If there are multiple facilitators within your project, our team has found it helpful for the group to discuss how the session went, any challenging points in the curriculum or session, and any reflections on the discussions with their groups. Here are some questions to get you started:

- How do you think the session went? Why do you think that?
- What could we do better? What would you like to improve about the session?
- What are some highlights or things to be emphasized about the session?
- What issues did you notice during the session that you would like to improve upon moving forward, whether technical or interpersonal issues?
- How can we ensure all facilitators are equipped with the proper language on the purpose and intent of Creating Peace?

## CURRICULUM OVERVIEW

## SESSION STRUCTURE

The curriculum is divided into 12 sessions, each focusing on a particular theme. All of the sessions are designed with a similar structure or format.

At the beginning of each session, the following information is presented for all of the activities within that session:

## Title and Duration

Each session has a title, which you may choose to share with the group. The recommended length of the session is also indicated.

## Purpose

The session's overarching goal is included in this section. This is important for young people to know in order to set expectations for the session.

## Materials

The materials required to facilitate the session are listed. In some cases, there are reference worksheets for the activities, which may need to be printed or shared with the young people.

## Activity Overview

Each session contains three or four activities, listed here.

Each session has three or four activities. The activities are broken into the following parts:

## Objective

Each activity's purpose is listed; the facilitator can inform the young people of the objectives before starting a new activity.

## Preparation

These are steps that the facilitator should take well in advance of the session to prepare for the activity. They should be done prior to the session to save time and ensure a smooth flow.

## Procedure

These are steps for carrying out the activity. The activities are written to be adapted to groups with different reading and writing levels. The facilitator should be attentive to whether the steps are appropriate for the young people.

## Group Discussion

Most of the activities include group discussion questions to help guide the discussion on the activity topic. These questions serve as guidance for the facilitator. It is not necessary to discuss all the questions or adhere to the order in which they are listed; however, the group discussion is an essential part of the activities.

## Homework Assignment (optional)

Some sessions have assignments for the young people to complete after the sessions. These have been found to be useful for continued engagement between sessions.

## Closing Statements

Facilitators give these final statements to the group after each activity to emphasize the activity's key messages.

## SEQUENCING OF SESSIONS

The Creating Peace curriculum is split into three main sections based on the sessions' focus. The sequence of the sessions roughly follows the socio-ecological model - from the individual to interpersonal and community levels. This curriculum is designed to allow young people to start by reflecting on their own knowledge and attitudes on gender and racial justice. Afterward, the sessions introduce elements of interpersonal interactions and relationships and of community norms. By the end of the curriculum, the young people will have unpacked some of the root causes of gender inequity and violence within their communities, as well as collectively designed a plan to address the challenges.

## CROSS-CUTTING THEMES

## GENDER-TRANSFORMATIVE

This curriculum builds on Equimundo's gender-transformative work around engaging individuals (boys and men specifically) in gender equality. Programs integrating a gender and power theoretical framework are generally classified on a spectrum ranging from 'gender-exploitative' (those that reinforce gender stereotypes and inequities) to 'gender-transformative' (those that actively target harmful stereotypes and norms and seek to transform those underlying gender inequalities). In between lies a continuum that also includes 'gender-sensitive' programming - programs recognizing the specific needs and realities of men and women but not seeking to change or influence gender relations and gender equity. 2  A literature review conducted by the World Health Organization on gender-related programs affirmed that interventions applying a gender-transformative approach are more likely to lead to changes in men and boys' attitudes than those that do not. 3  Of note, Creating Peace is inclusive of all genders, recognizing that all young people benefit from building critical analytical skills around gender equity, racial justice, and learning in order to challenge patriarchal structures.

## RACIAL JUSTICE

Throughout this curriculum, young people will be able to identify points in history that have been racially unjust and historical responses to those injustices. Young people have an opportunity to explore racial injustice with an intersectional lens (specifically, race, gender, and capitalism). This will allow them to see how racism has impacted the history of our country, how racism has affected their family and their lineage, and how racism continues to affect them in the present.

Young people will learn background on the curriculum and what is planned for the program.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Write the activity outline for the session on a piece of flipchart paper and post it on the wall. (Please keep all of the activity outlines from Session 1 - 7 for an activity in Session 8.)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 3 Ask young people to share their name, age, pronouns, grade, and current school they attend. You can also ask them to share another fact about themselves to make this more enjoyable. ?
- 4 Explain the difference between being a teacher and a facilitator . (You can use some of the language found in the earlier 'Facilitator's Guide' section.)
- 5 Present the main goals of Creating Peace by reading the flipchart paper. Summarize the following text in your own words:

## What is Creating Peace?

Creating Peace is based on a methodology that was developed in different countries around the world where young people have been exposed to negative experiences of violence, war, social exclusion, discrimination, and more. Such experiences may lead to negative effects on the way you feel about yourself and others, and they can affect your behavior and strain relationships with others.

Creating Peace aims to support young people like you in finding meaningful, positive, and nonviolent ways to deal with painful and negative experiences in order to build peace in your heart and mind, your schools, your families, and your communities.

## How does Creating Peace work?

During a series of 12 group sessions, you will undertake a journey with a group of your peers that is guided by facilitators. This journey will help to explore new directions in dealing with difficulties and challenges that all of you have likely encountered in life. You will develop new skills and ideas that can strengthen your capacities to deal with those difficulties at home and in your community. The Creating Peace group sessions are very different from normal class, where the teacher is bringing you new knowledge in a lecture format. In Creating Peace sessions, we all learn by listening, sharing, experiencing, reflecting, and practicing.

## Creating Peace is a journey.

You can compare it to a journey, a trip that we take together in which we need each other at every step we take. We all are carrying a 'backpack' full of experiences, memories, and mindsets we have collected in our lives until now. In the journey, we will unpack this backpack, add new items, and choose the items we want to leave behind and replace with others. Your destination in the journey is your future, your plans, your ambitions, and your well-being.

## The Creating Peace group is like a laboratory.

The group sessions are a place to analyze which strategies work and which do not work well in managing the challenges you currently face. Although the Creating Peace group cannot change the outside world (a world that has been unjust and unfair to you and others, one that may have hurt you and your families), this Creating Peace

group can help you to change the way you travel in that world and experience the importance of collaboration, friendship, solidarity, and support.

Traveling together is a way to learn about yourself through others by exchanging, sharing, listening, and seeing. The Creating Peace group aims to improve your equipment in the backpack, providing the best possible skills and knowledge: skills and knowledge that may in the short and long term - help you to become meaningfully involved in building a world of peace, solidarity, and love.

Ask the young people if they have any questions.

- Briefly summarize the sessions and their activities using the flipchart paper posted on the wall. 7
- There are positive ways to deal with negative experiences. We can choose to respond to adversity in nonviolent ways.
- We are all learning from each other. I will learn from you as much as you will learn from me.
- You don't know until you try. Be open to trying new skills and hearing different perspectives.

## GROUP AGREEMENTS &amp; CREATING A SAFE &amp; BRAVE LEARNING SPACE

(Virtual adaptation available in Annex E)

<!-- image -->

Young people will collectively agree on a list of rules and expectations that will enable a safe, respectful, and comfortable space for members of the group to talk freely about personal and sensitive subjects.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Write 'Group Agreements' at the top of a piece of flipchart paper.

1

## Explain:

- a. The program is going to involve discussing a lot of topics that are personal and potentially sensitive. It is extremely important that this be a safe, respectful, and comfortable space for members of the group to talk freely about such personal and sensitive subjects.
- b. To make this program a safe, respectful, and comfortable space, the group needs a set of agreements that everyone agrees to follow.
- c.  What we mean by a brave space is that not only should everyone feel safe to share their opinions and perspectives, but they should also feel encouraged to do so to support well-balanced discussions.
4. ASK the young people: 2 ?
- a. What does safety mean for you? What makes a place safe or unsafe?
- b. What (or who) can help to make you feel safe?
7. Ask young people what sort of agreements are important to have safe and respectful discussions. Write them on the flipchart paper as you go. 3
8. If the young people cannot think of any, use the following list: 4

## GROUP AGREEMENTS

-  Respect others.
-  Listen for understanding, not responding.
-  Struggle together, but stay in relationship with each other.
-  Call in; don't call out.
-  Use 'put-ups,' not put-downs.
-  Don't use jokes that are harmful or hurtful to others.
-  Respect the right of others to have different opinions.
-  Let others finish speaking.
-  Don't generalize about people. Talk about 'some' instead of 'all.'
-  Use 'I' statements' - own your opinions.
-  You have the right to pass if you feel uncomfortable.
-  Confidentiality and trust are important - what's said here stays here, but what's learned here leaves here.
-  Participate in ways that feel safe for you.
-  There is no 'quick fix' - this is a process.

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

## (Optional) Homework Assignment

## Closing Statements

- Read each agreement aloud, stopping to ask for any clarifying questions that young people want answered to be able to uphold each agreement. 5
- Once the agreements are understood, ask young people whether they have additional statements they would like to suggest to the group. 6
- Ask y oung people to sign their names on the flipchart paper if these group agreements are acceptable to them. 7

During each session, you can connect the principles to dynamics that may occur in the group, or with certain members. Make sure that you use them in positive ways. For example:

- If a participant hardly speaks in the group, ask: 'I am interested in your opinions. Would you be willing to share some thoughts?'
- If a student offends or hurts other students in the group, ask: 'I see you are angry and hurting - am I right? I also see that some of your behaviors are hurtful to others. What is needed to help you feel better and be accountable?'
- If a student is always arriving late, ask: 'What is taking you away from your responsibility to come on time and start together with us?'
- Talk to someone at home, at school, or in the community that you trust:
- Tell them about the idea of Creating Peace: What rules, values, and norms are applied to create safe places?
- What are the main risks or threats to feeling safe?
- Could anything in our group agreements be applied outside the group?
- We are here to learn, so there are no stupid questions. It is important that we are respectful to one another even when we disagree or think someone's question may be silly.
-  We asked everyone to sign the agreements because it is up to everyone in the group to maintain them. If you see your peers not upholding an agreement, then please remind them so we can keep on track.

## EXPLORING WHERE WE COME FROM

<!-- image -->

## Objective

<!-- image -->

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Young people will identify specific points in history that relate to their family lineage and reflect on how racism, social injustices, and other forms of discrimination have impacted their personal history and the history of this country.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Write the activity for the session on a piece of flipchart paper and post it on the wall.
- Open Anthony Hamilton's music video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4LVf9qdFYA
- Read the model poems on Support Sheet #1.3.3 so you can better support the young people with the creation of their own.
- Print copies of Support Sheet #1.3.1, #1.3.2, and #1.3.3 for each participant
- Fill out your own poem example to use as a reference if students ask you questions.
- Share Support Sheet #1.3.2 (the YogaRoots On Location 'Museum of Feelings') as a resource for young people to find language that expresses feelings and emotions. 1
- Tell young people that they are going to listen to a song called 'Comin' From Where I'm From.' Afterward, the group will discuss what lyrics or parts of the music video spoke to them and how the song made them feel. 2
- Hand out copies of Support Sheet 1.3.1 and have participants follow along as you play Anthony Hamilton's 'Comin' From Where I'm From' music video as an introduction to storytelling. 3
- Check in with young people to see what comes up for them watching this song. ASK: 4 ?
- a. Using the ''Museum of Feelings' support sheet, choose a few feelings and emotions that you're feeling now. What are they? And where did you feel these emotions in your body? (Facilitator's Note: Silence is okay in this conversation - it might take young people a few moments to process their feelings. We encourage you to wait to share your own feelings until after they have shared.)

<!-- image -->

## Closing Statements

?

- b. Were there any specific lyrics or visuals that spoke to you?
2. Transition by saying that now that they've shared their thoughts around how Anthony Hamilton shares the story of where he is from, they'll have the opportunity to tell one of their stories. 5
3. Pass out Support Sheet #1.3.3 and begin the 'Where I'm From' activity: 6
- a. Have the young people complete the 'Where I'm From' template. Say that there are no wrong responses and everyone will have different interpretations of the poem's directions.
- b. Ask a few young people to share their poem if they feel comfortable.
- c. ASK: How did completing this poem make you feel?
- Although we did not choose a lot of what we have experienced up until now, it's important for us to realize that we can choose how to tell our story and we can make new memories in the future.
- Our personal and collective histories show the importance of resilience that we've had over generations and remind us how we can survive and thrive.
-  It's important to sit with our histories and reflect on the sadness, happiness, and everything in between, as well as to tell our stories authentically and look toward a resilient and prosperous future.
- Storytelling is powerful. Consider sharing your poem with someone you love. Ask them to create their poem to share with you.

## IMPORTANT

Make sure young people have a sheet with local resources and review with young people how to reach you with questions or to discuss any topics that came up in the session in greater depth.

## Lyrics of 'Comin' From Where I'm From'

## by Anthony Hamilton

Sittin here gues I didn't make bail Got time and a story to tell Started when I was nine years old Woke up my dady was gone I started hustlin they couldn't tell me nothin Frontin in the hood tryin to be somebody My soul was on empty I was searchin for something Tried to be good; Tried to keep from trouble Livin too fast; Tryin to make good on a hustle Sometimes it gets rough Comin from where I'm from, I'm from Times got hard Comin from where I'm from, I'm from Some times you gotta walk to work (yeah) Comin from where I'm from, I'm from Sometimes you gotta do a little dirt Comin from where I'm from I'm from Wasn't really lookin gues I found it Five foot three, light brown skin Comin from the university Nice style, lookin kinda lovely Didn't know she had much game Down to ride out, even take the train Even took her to a poker game She's top notch from fried chicken to sushi Tried to be good, (I tried) tried to treat you like a lady Tried to be a friend, turned out that you were shady Sometimes it gets lonely

## 'Where I'm From' Poem Examples

Use this template to draft your poem, and then write a final draft to share on blank paper.

## ORIGINAL POEM Where I'm From by George Ella Lyon

I am from clothespins, from Clorox and carbon-tetrachloride. I am from the dirt under the back porch. (Black, glistening, it tasted like beets.) I am from the forsythia bush the Dutch elm whose long-gone limbs I remember as if they were my own.

I'm from fudge and eyeglasses, from Imogene and Alafair. I'm from the know-it-alls and the pass-it-ons, from Perk up! and Pipe down! I'm from He restoreth my soul with a coGLYPH&lt;31&gt;onball lamb and ten verses I can say myself. I'm from Artemus and Billie's Branch, fried corn and strong coGLYPH&lt;30&gt;ee. From the GLYPH&lt;29&gt;nger my grandfather lost to the auger, the eye my father shut to keep his sight.

Under my bed was a dress box spilling old pictures, a sift of lost faces to drift beneath my dreams. I am from those momentssnapped before I buddedleaf-fall from the family tree.

## MODEL POEM Where I'm From by Ms. Vaca

I am from bookshelves, from vinegar and green detergent. I am from the dog hair in every corner (Yellow, abundant, the vacuum could never get it all.) I am from azaleas the magnolia tree whose leaves crunched under my feet like snow every fall. I'm from puzzles and sunburns, from Dorothy Ann and Mary Christine Catherine I'm from reading and road trips From 'Please watch your brother' and 'Don't let your brother hit you!' I'm from Easter sunrises and Iowa churches at Christmas I'm from Alexandria and the Rileys, Sterzing's potato chips and sponge candy. From my Air Force dad's refusal to go to Vietnam, from my mom's leaving home at 17. On a low shelf in my new house is a stack of photo albums, carefully curated by my faraway father, chronicling my childhood. I am from these pages, yellowed but GLYPH&lt;31&gt;rm, holding on to me across the country.

## MAPPING OUR HISTORIES

Objective

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

Procedure

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Young people will identify specific points in history that relate to their family lineage and reflect on how racism, social injustices, and other forms of discrimination have impacted their personal history and the history of this country.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- If you are doing the Kahoot trivia game for the terms in the glossary, prepare this ahead of time.
- Tell young people that this activity builds on the 'Exploring Where We Come From' activity from the previous session. Check in with young people to see what comes up for them watching this song. 1
- Transition by 2

SAYING:

- a. Now that we are getting to know each other a little bit better through sharing our stories, our stories are part of a bigger human narrative. So, the way our stories play out is oftentimes in response to these larger stories, policies, and procedures. Your story is a subset of the larger American narrative.
- b. So, we want to transition to looking at our stories through the lens of our history. An ahistorical narrative says that colonialism and oppression are good as seen through the lens of the oppressor. That is why we need to take an antiracist historical lens to look at a more inclusive narrative. What we're doing is expanding how history has been told to include other people's historical experience (not just those of the oppressor).
- c. We are going to be looking at two support sheets today - one is a timeline from the book Stamped , and the other is a glossary of some useful terms.
4. Explore Support Sheet #2.2.1 ('Glossary of Terms'): 3
- a. Split the support sheet across the group and have each participant read two to three items. Then, have young people read the definitions aloud as written.
- b. After they've read through all of the terms, ask the following

## Group Discussion

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

- 4

questions about a term they have in mind. Have the young people think to themselves about the answers.

- What does this term mean to you in your own words? Paraphrase.
- Is the term something that is present in society now? If so, how do you see it showing up? How is the term relevant today?
- Is this a complete definition? Is something missing?
- Are there any important terms that aren't included in this handout? What do they mean, and why are they important to you?
- c. For a more interactive activity, if time allows, you can make a Kahoot trivia game where young people can match the term and the definition.

## Transition by SAYING:

- a. To understand history, we have to understand terminology. We must study terminology so that we have a common language to discuss history.
- b. Sankofa is an Adinkra term and symbol from Ghana that translates as 'to look into one's past in order to move forward.' To have a united front, we must look back and understand what was done with common language so that we can look forward and envision what we want our futures to be.
3. 5 Using Support Sheet #2.2.2 ('Stamped (for Kids) Timeline') :
- a. Split the participants into four groups, and give one page of the timeline to each group.
- b. Have young people choose timeline points that interest them and discuss them in the small groups.
- Are there important events you all know about that should be on this timeline?
- How do you see yourself in this history?
- How is it relevant to you and your community?
- Is there one event in the timeline that is impactful to you (positive or negative)?

<!-- image -->

You may want to ask young people if they felt particularly proud, sad, angry, or any other emotion.

<!-- image -->

- We are here to begin the journey of owning our histories; learning about the past helps us create a pathway for the future.
- We will continue to talk about historical events - both the injustices as well as the triumphs. You, too, are making history by being a part of Creating Peace.

## CIRCLES OF INFLUENCE

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Young people will recognize how the thoughts, beliefs, and actions of others influence our own.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Using the masking tape, tape several pieces of flipchart paper to the floor to make four large concentric circles, as shown in the following drawing. Label the circles (from smallest to largest) 'individual,' 'relationship,' 'community,' and 'society.'
- Prepare name tags for each of the characters in Support Sheet #2.3.1 ('Character Statements').
- Photocopy and cut out the character statements in Support Sheet #2.3.1 (in large print for easier reading). Fold each statement in half so no one can read them, and clip or pile each one with the corresponding name tag.
- Explain: 1
- a. This session will explore how we need to reach out to all of the different people and groups in a community to effect community change.
- b. In this next exercise, we'll explore how the thoughts, beliefs, and actions of others create community norms (or community 'rules') and how these norms influence change in the community.
- c. Norms are unwritten rules in a society that guide how people behave. Norms can and do change over time.
- Bring their attention to the four concentric circles on the floor. 2
- Ask the young people to take one pile (consisting of one name tag and one piece of paper) and a piece of tape. Ask young people to tape the name 3

tags to their chests. Tell them they can read their pieces of paper, but only to themselves.

- Ask the young people who have chosen the characters 'Jordan' and 'Jessica' to stand inside the smallest, innermost circle. 4
- Ask the rest of the young people to read out their roles. 5
- Bring their attention to the circles on the ground. Ask the group to decide in which circle their character would fit - individual, relationship, community, or society. Have them talk with each other if they don't know where they should go or are confused. 6
- Have young people take their place in the circle. Then, looking at the innermost circle, explain: 7
- a. These individuals are named Jordan and Jessica. Jessica and Jordan, please introduce yourselves to the group by each reading the first sentence on your piece of paper.
- After they read, explain that you will ask one participant to introduce themselves and to read only their first sentence aloud to Jordan and Jessica. Jordan and Jessica are the main characters in this exercise. This participant will then tap another participant, who will do the same, until all young people have had a turn. 8
- Ensure there are no questions. Start the exercise by randomly choosing one of the young people to go first. 9
- Once everyone has had a turn, conduct a short debrief using the following questions (make sure young people remain in position): 10
- a. Which circle do you think has the most influence on Jordan and Jessica? Why?
- b. Do any of the circles have no influence on Jordan and Jessica? Why or why not?
- c. What does this exercise tell us about the social rules or expectations in our community?
- d. What does this mean for how we understand the world and how we act?
- Reiterate the key points in the following box before moving on to the next part of the activity. 11

## KEY POINTS

- Everyone is influenced by many factors and people without even realizing it.
- People are usually influenced the most by the people who are the nearest to them. They influence us in everyday life.

- Even community members who are not as close to us as friends and family influence how we think and act.
- Broader societal influences, like the media and national laws, also affect individuals, even if it isn't as direct or immediate.
- Around all of us are circles of influence: family and friends, community members, and society.
- Explain to young people that they will now continue the exercise as follows: 12
- a. Skipping Jordan and Jessica (they will go after the rest of the group), one person will begin by reading the second sentence aloud. They will then tap one person on the shoulder (and return to their place in the circles), and the tapped person will read their second sentence.
- b. The game will continue like this until everyone, except for Jordan and Jessica, has read their second sentence.
- c. When everybody has read their second sentence, ask Jordan and Jessica to read theirs.
- Debrief the game by ASKING: 13 ?
- a. What happened when more people were convinced of the benefits of engaging in preventing violence?
- b. What can we learn about effective community mobilization from this exercise?
- Introduce Support Sheet #2.3.2 by SAYING: 14
- a. Now that we have heard the story of Jordan and Jessica, we would like for you all to look at your own lives and circles of influence.
- b. On the support sheet, please write down the names of people who would fit within each circle of influence. Afterward, I will ask whoever is comfortable to share a few of their circles with the group.
- Have young people fill out Support Sheet #2.3.2 for their own circles of influence. 15
- (Optional) If time allows, have a few members of the group share their circles of influence and discuss. 16
- Ideas in the community can change, and everyone has a role to play.
- It is up to everyone in the community to create a supportive environment for new behaviors and attitudes.
- Just as others are in your circle of influence, you are in theirs. Be mindful of your impact on others as you live your life, and remember, even if you are removed from a situation, you may still be affected indirectly.

## Closing Statements

## JESSICA [she/her]

- My name is Jessica. I am dating Jordan. Recently, Jordan and I had an argument, and it escalated into a physical fight. 1
- My name is Jessica. Jordan and I talk to one another about how to work through our issues without getting too worked up and angry. 2

## JORDAN [he/they]

- My name is Jordan. I am dating Jessica. We recently had a fight where she hit me, so I pushed her back. I don't think it's a big deal because I've seen other family and friends handle their issues like that. 1
- My name is Jordan. After going to Creating Peace and talking with my group, I believe I have a responsibility to take an active role in handling conflicts in a way where violence isn't the solution. Jessica and I now have open conversations about our issues and work together to find healthy resolutions. 2

## JORDAN'S FATHER [he/him]

- I am Jordan's father. I was raised understanding that arguments always have a winner and loser, and it's always better to be the winner. 1
- I am Jordan's father. Men and women should have open and honest communications around their issues and loved qualities for one another. Arguments should end, if possible, in a mutual understanding and - at the very least - without violent escalation. 2

## JORDAN'S FRIEND [she/her]

- I am a friend of Jordan. We hang out a lot. I believe that you can't show weakness, especially in arguments with a girlfriend. It's important to show strength and dominance so that she respects you. 1
- I am a friend of Jordan. When we talk, I respect him for taking an active role in healthy communication with his girlfriend. It definitely seems to make them both happier and more fulfilled in their relationship. In fact, now, I do the same with my partner. 2

## SUPPORT SHEET #2.3.1 Character Statements

## JESSICA'S FRIEND [she/her]

- I am a friend of Jessica. She and I talk about everything. My relationship is similar to hers - my partner and I argue, and sometimes, it gets a little out of hand. It happens sometimes when you love each other. 1
- I am a friend of Jessica. My partner and I can and should make a point of handling our disagreements by understanding each other's perspectives and actively listening to avoid misunderstanding. 2

## JESSICA'S AUNT [she/her]

- I am Jessica's aunt. I believe people should just handle relationship issues behind closed doors. It's a personal problem and nobody else's business. 1
- I am Jessica's aunt. I believe that it is important to have conversations with our kids about healthy relationships and spotting dangerous or unhealthy habits in their partners to both protect themselves and help ensure their partners do not self-harm. 2

## JORDAN'S CLASSMATE [he/they]

- I am Jordan's classmate. We sit next to each other in class and talk from time to time. He says he and his girlfriend got into a fight yesterday and sometimes he has to 'defend' himself by hitting back. I say nothing. It isn't my business. I'm sure he would be offended or humiliated if I called him out. 1
- I am Jordan's classmate. I tell him that it is very important to find alternatives to violence with his partner and encourage him to find healthier ways to communicate. 2

## TEACHER [she/her]

- I am a teacher. I teach health class. Every year, I teach the same thing. I mostly focus my attention on the girls; I don't care if the boys listen as long as I fulfill my requirements. 1
- I am a teacher. Recently, I attended a gender training on men's roles in deterring violence in relationships and broader society. I now specifically invite boys to talk to me or one of the other health teachers if they have questions. I am also finding ways to incorporate messages about gender equality and joint responsibility into my school lessons! 2

## YOUTH CENTER WORKER [they/them]

- I am a program director at a youth center. The center works with young people to promote health. Most of the time, it's only girls who come in for questions about their relationships because they care more than the boys do. 1
- I am a program director at a youth center. The center sees the importance of working with people of all genders and sexual identities to promote joint decision-making and key traits of healthy relationships. We now hold Creating Peace sessions to help encourage young people to take an active role in both their partners' and their own mental health, reflecting on past trauma. 2

## COACH [he/him]

- I am Jordan's coach. We are close, and I talk to him about school. He is an excellent football player. I don't talk about his personal life because that is none of my business. 1
- I am Jordan's coach. Although football include hitting and other forms of violence, I encourage him and other players to find healthy alternatives to violence and conflict off the field. It is important to his future to avoid and deter others from situations where they could be hurt or wind up hurting someone else. I am here to support him if he has questions. 2

## POLICE OFFICER [he/him]

- I am a police officer who is new to the force. I've responded to a number of fights and domestic conflicts. We just find it is easier to arrest everyone rather than talk through the situation, which can be timeconsuming for our already overburdened staff. 1
- I am a police officer. We know that conflicts are usually caused by some sort of misunderstanding or misalignment of perspectives. We've found that in responding to these kinds of calls, not making immediate judgments and offering confidential resources to both may help resolve the problem. 2

## CITY COUNCIL MEMBER [he/him]

- I am a city council member. I work with my fellow council members to decide where funding needs to go. There are many more important things that our council needs to take care of, and we just don't have the resources to support a healthy relationships and violence prevention campaign. 1
- I am a city council member. I attended a workshop on gender and health and on engaging young people in violence prevention. I am working with my fellow council members to make sure there is enough funding so that organizations, clinics, and schools have the resources they need to engage young people and help support them. 2

## NATALIA'S STORY

20 Minutes

<!-- image -->

- Pass out Support Sheets #3.2.1 and #3.2.2. Ask participants to have Support Sheet #3.2.1 out and to read along. Additionally, have them flip to the back of Support Sheet #3.2.2 (the definitions). Tell them to reference these definitions as you read through the story. 1
- Using Support Sheet #3.2.1, ask for a volunteer to help read the first part of Natalia's Story (until the line): 2

Natalia's Story, Part 1: It is a beautiful spring morning. A mom lies in her hospital bed. Her partner holds her hand, and a midwife cheers her along. 'You are so close! Okay, let's take a deep breath in, a deep breath out, then one more big push!' Just minutes later, the entire room fills with the baby's first cry. 'The baby looks so healthy!' the midwife says. The midwife cleans off the baby, looks down at the baby's genitals, swaddles it in a pink blanket, and hands the baby to the mom.

'Congratulations, she's a girl!' exclaims the midwife. 'What will you name her?' 'Natalia! Just like her grandmother,' the mom replies. A few days later, the mom leaves the hospital with her swaddled, sleeping baby. In the mom's hand is the birth certificate, which reads:

'SEX: FEMALE.    NAME: NATALIA DIAZ.'

## SAY to the group:

- a. And here, at birth, is where our story of sex and gender begins to take shape.
- b. When we are born, each of us is assigned a sex. In most states in the US, there are only two options on our birth certificates - 'male' and 'female.' The nurse, doctor, or midwife looks at a baby's external genitalia (penis or vulva) and decides which sex category they fit into: 'male' or 'female.'
- c. There is more to a person's sex than just their external genitalia. A person's sex is actually defined by their physical body, including not just genitals but also reproductive organs, chromosomes, and even their hormones.
- d. So, there is actually a lot of variation among different bodies, but from the very first day of our lives, someone checks a box, and we get put into one of two categories.

## ASK the group:

- a. Now, if this baby's birth certificate says 'female,' how does this affect the way society might view them or treat them?
- b. What norms, expectations, or pressures might this baby grow up with?
- Some probing questions could include: What kind of clothes would they likely wear? What kinds of toys would they likely play with? What types of activities would they likely do?
- Write responses on a flipchart paper.

## After the brainstorming, SAY :

- a. As we grow up, our families, friends, and even the media send us messages about how we should act and dress, what types of toys we should play with, and even to whom we should be attracted.
- b. These expectations that society puts on us are called gender norms. They are called norms because the expectations are considered the 'norm' or 'normal' by a lot of people in the community. As we just talked about, examples of this are the colors, toys, and even names we give people.
- c. Typically, because of the sex we are assigned at birth, we are raised to believe there are only two genders: 'female' or 'male.' But we know that is not true. There are many gender identities that people have.

- ? ASK: 6
- SAY: 7
- 'Bi-' is a prefix that means 'two.' For example, a bicycle has two wheels, being bilingual means you can speak two languages, and binoculars have two lenses.
- b. 'Binary' means something with two groups or options, typically opposites - like hot or cold, on or off.
- c. When we talk about 'binary' in relation to gender, it means that people think of gender as only two categories ('men' and 'women') that are completely distinct from one another. As we will explore throughout this curriculum, there are many other genders besides 'man' and 'woman' that people identify as.

## ASK the group:

- a. When I say gender identity, what does that mean? Possible answers: Gender identity is someone's sense of self; how someone feels about who they are; if someone feels like a boy or girl; someone whose sex assigned at birth feels wrong to them - transgender.
- b. What are some gender identities that you have heard of? Possible answers: cisgender, transwoman, transman, genderqueer, nonbinary, man, woman.

## After the brainstorming, SAY: 9

- a. Exactly! Someone's gender identity is their internal sense of their own gender. Some people identify as a man, a woman, a cisgender man or woman, a transgender man or woman, nonbinary, genderqueer, and much more.
- b. Gender is also fluid, meaning it can move or change. Someone's gender can change throughout their life. Some people's gender identity might align with their sex assigned at birth, and for others, it might not.
3. ? ASK: 10
- a. Now that we know what gender identity is, can you identify events in Natalia's story that make assumptions about the baby's gender? Possible answers: the fact that the baby was swaddled in a pink blanket, given a traditionally feminine name, and given the pronouns 'she' and 'hers.' These instances are bolded in the original story.

<!-- image -->

11

## SAY:

- a. Now that we have learned that gender identity is an internal sense of one's own gender, it's important to recognize that people choose to express that on the outside in many different ways. The way someone chooses to express their gender identity is known as gender expression. This is everything from their clothing and voice to behaviors and mannerisms.
2. ? 8
- a. What does the word 'binary' mean?

FACILITATOR'S

NOTE

Have the same or different volunteers continue to read the rest of Support Sheet #3.2.1.

## Follow along as volunteer(s) read: 14

Natalia's Story, Part 2: Natalia has grown up! She is not quite 15 and in ninth grade. The first dance is coming up, and her mom keeps asking her which guy she hopes will ask her to the dance. Natalia doesn't really know how to answer this question because there's a girl she really likes in her class and would love to go with her. They have developed a really close emotional connection over the past year, and Natalia is starting to feel physically attracted to her.

15

ASK the group:

- a. What additional parts of Natalia's identity are we discussing here? Answer: sexual orientation, or which gender(s) Natalia is physically and/or emotionally attracted to.
- b. What are some sexual orientations that you are familiar with? (Write these down on a flipchart.)
- c. Is what we just learned about Natalia related to her sex assigned at birth or gender identity?

Answer: No, although they are all related to someone's full sexuality and identity, sex assigned at birth, gender  identity, and sexual orientation are distinct and don't always align with society's expectations.

?

## ASK:

- a. What are some examples of gender expression that you have seen?
- b. What expectations does society have as it relates to gender and expression? Are certain people expected to express themselves in a certain way?

Possible answers: Men are expected to dress 'masculine,' and women are expected to dress 'feminine.'

- c. How does the gender binary (male/female) restrict people from expressing themselves more freely?
- d. How do you think feeling restricted can affect people?

SAY:

- a. Now that we have an idea of what sex assigned at birth, gender identity, and gender expression are, let's explore other parts of our identities. Let's continue with Natalia's story.

## THE GENDER UNICORN

- 16

<!-- image -->

15 Minutes

<!-- image -->

Bring participants' attention to Support Sheet #3.2.2 ('The Gender Unicorn').

- SAY to the group: 17
- a. Here's a way to visualize these different parts of our identities. As you'll see on this worksheet, each category has multiple arrows that show us that these identities aren't just solely male or female - it is a spectrum that can include different options.
- b. Masculine and feminine are not inherently opposed. Some people use this worksheet to think about how they identify by placing a dot on each of the arrows. We are going to watch a video that explains how it works. You can take it home and fill it out according to your own identity.
- Play the seven-minute video explaining the gender unicorn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPNCzXYy2CE 18
- ? 19

ASK the group:

- a. Do you have any questions about what you just watched?
- b. How does the gender unicorn make you feel?

## GENDERED SCENARIOS

<!-- image -->

- SAY to the group: 20
- a. In small groups, you are going to read a scenario about a young person. During these stories, you might notice that society has specific expectations of them based on how they perceive their gender.
- b. As you just learned, gender is something that people have created and is not necessarily biological. You will see how this plays out in these scenarios. Together, you will read the scenario and answer a few questions.
- c. You will have 12 minutes to complete the assignment. Then, you will share your scenario and responses with the large group. Are there any questions about the assignment?
- Split participants into four groups. Pass out the cut-out scenarios from Support Sheet #3.2.3, and start a timer for 12 minutes. 21
- Have the small groups present on what they discussed about their scenarios. 22

<!-- image -->

20 Minutes

## Closing Statements

- Every person has a sex assigned at birth, a gender identity, gender expression, and a sexual orientation. All of these aspects vary from person to person. There is amazing diversity among human beings.
- Some people identify and express themselves in ways that challenge society's norms and expectations.
- It' s critical for all of us to appreciate and respect our identities and the identities of others. Before the next class, I encourage you to fill out the gender unicorn for yourself. Spend time thinking about your own sex assigned at birth, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.

| GENDER IDENTITY                 | One's internal sense of being male, female, neither of these, both, or (an)other gender(s). Everyone has a gender identity, including you. For transgender people, their sex assigned at birth and their owninternal sense of gender identity are not the same. Female, woman, and girl and male, man, and boy are also not necessarily linked to each other but are just six commongenderidentities. Cisgender, or simply cis , is an adjective that describes a person whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth. Transgender , or simply trans , is an adjective used to describesomeone whosegenderidentity differs from the sex assigned at birth. Atransgender man, for example, is someonewhowaslisted as female at birth butwhose gender identity is male. Nonbinary is a term that can be used by people whodonotdescribe themselvesortheirgendersasfittingintothecategoriesofmanorwoman. Arange of terms are used to refer to these experiences; nonbinary and genderqueer are amongthe terms that are sometimes used.   |

| GENDER EXPRESSION/ PRESENTATION | The physical manifestation of one's gender identity through clothing, hairstyle, voice, body shape, etc. Many transgender people seek tomake their gender expression (how they look) match their gender identity (who they are), rather than their sex assigned at birth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| SEX ASSIGNED AT BIRTH           | The assignment and classification of people as male, female, intersex, or another sex based on a combination of anatomy, hormones, chromosomes. It is important wedon't simply use 'sex' because of the vagueness of the definition of sex and its place in transphobia. Chromosomes are frequently used to determine sex from prenatal karyotyping (although not as often as genitalia). Chromosomes do not always determine genitalia, sex, or gender.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

It is important to note that sexual and romantic/ emotional attraction can comefromvarious factors including but not limited to gender identity, gender expression/presentation, and sex assigned at birth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## EMOTIONALLY ATTRACTED TO

Romantic/emotional orientation. It is important to note that sexual and romantic/emotional attraction can be from a variety of factors including but not limited to gender identity, gender expression/presentation, and sex assigned at birth. There are other types of attraction related to gender such as aesthetical or platonic. These are simply two common forms of attraction.

## SCENARIO 1

MATEO is a 15-year-old young man who uses he/him pronouns. He is pansexual, meaning he is attracted to people of all genders. Mateo moved to a new town and is attending a new school. He is excited and nervous about meeting friends. Mateo loves self-expression through style - everything from colorful sneakers to an occasional high heel to accessories like rings and earrings. At this new school, peers started calling Mateo gay and making fun of him because of what he wears. Let's talk about this:

- What part(s) of the Gender Unicorn does this story apply to?
- What expectations does society have of Mateo based on how they perceive Mateo's gender?
- How are society's expectations holding Mateo back in terms of how he expresses himself (self-expression)?
- How might this experience affect Mateo's mental health, relationships, sexual health, and well-being?
- If you were one of Mateo's new peers, how could you support, include, and show respect to Mateo?

## SCENARIO 2

CARTER is a 17-year-old nonbinary person who uses they/them pronouns. Carter was playing basketball at the YMCA and practice just finished. This is Carter's first-time playing pick-up at the YMCA, and they realize there are only two group locker rooms - one sign says MEN, and the other WOMEN. One of Carter's teammates says, 'Are you coming with?' as he walks into the men's locker room. Carter hesitates for a minute and starts to feel overwhelmed. They decide just to pack their bag and head to the bus to go home. Let's talk about this:

- What part(s) of the Gender Unicorn does this story apply to?
- What expectations does society have of Mateo based on Carter's gender is perceived?
- How might this experience affect Carter's mental health, relationships, sexual health, and well-being?
- What are some other examples of how spaces are designed that can leave people like Carter feeling excluded?

## SUPPORT SHEET #3.2.3 Gendered Scenarios Handout

## SCENARIO 3

JADA (she/her) and DANTE (he/him) are good friends. They are juniors in high school and are both wanting to get into a good college. They are sitting next to each other in class when their teacher, Mrs. Jackson, hands back tests they took last week. Even after hours and hours of studying together, they both received failing grades.

Suddenly, they both feel a sweeping sense of sadness and anger come over them. Jada puts her head down, and Dante quietly starts crying at his desk. Immediately, Jada's friends come over and try to comfort her. One student comes over to Dante, jokingly slaps him on the back, and says, 'Don't be such a pussy.' Dante sits there all alone. Let's talk about this:

- What part(s) of the Gender Unicorn does this story apply to?
- What expectations does society have of Jada and Dante based on how their gender is perceived?
- How might this experience affect Jada's and Dante's mental health, relationships, sexual health, and well-being?
- What effects and consequences can these expectations have on the way that Jada and Dante express themselves in the future?

## SCENARIO 4

AMIR (he/him) and SOFIA (she/her) dated for a year but split up a few months ago. Their friends at school were bummed about the breakup because they really liked them together. Amir hasn't dated anyone since he and Sofia split, but Amir did meet Diego (he/they) online a few weeks ago. Diego goes to a different school but lives in the same city, so they have met up a few times to hang out.

Amir and Diego have been getting super close and have started developing romantic feelings for each other. Amir doesn't exactly know how this new relationship will be received, but he does want his friends to meet Diego. Amir invites Diego to come with him to the next high school basketball game. When they walk into the gym, Diego reaches for Amir's hand. They walk across the gym and watch as classmates start to point and whisper. Let's talk about this:

- What part(s) of the Gender Unicorn does this story apply to?
- What expectations does society have of Amir and Diego based on how their gender and sexual orientation are perceived?
- How might this experience affect Amir's, Diego's, and Sofia's mental health, relationships, sexual health, and well-being?
- What effects and consequences can these expectations have on the way that Amir and Diego express themselves in the future?

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

## Procedure

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Young people will be able to explain the challenges different genders face in trying to fulfill societal expectations; appreciate the costs of a binary society and rigid forms of masculinity and femininity; and recognize that because the gender binary was created by people, it is also possible to change.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Print copies of Support Sheet #3.3.1 ('Gender Boxes Handout') - one per person.
- Have music to play in the background.

1

## SAY

- a. You all are going to work individually on a handout, which will help you explore the different expectations and pressures you experience based on your gender.
- b. You will have ten minutes to complete it. You can write your responses directly on the page. Feel free to use the front or back of the paper.
3. Pass out copies of Support Sheet #3.3.1 to each participant. 2
4. Start a ten-minute timer. Put on calming music in the background. 3
5. When the timer goes off, ask participants to come back together. Read each of the prompts and ask participants to share. Remind participants to only share what they are comfortable with. 4

## SAY 5

- a. Thanks for sharing. This is a really important exercise and concept to think about as we go through the other sessions.
- b. In many ways, we behave in the way society wants us to - whether we know it or not. Ideas around manhood, womanhood, and being nonbinary come with a lot of baggage.

<!-- image -->

## ASK ? 6

- a. Although we are talking about all genders here, I also want to specifically talk about masculinity and the social expectations that men face. First, think about what we have heard today from young men about what pressures they feel. What effects might these pressures have on young men?
- b. How might these pressures influence how they interact or behave with other people?
- There can be consequences when individuals do not conform to these societal expectations of gender roles: for example, a man being called names or isolated from peers or friends because he isn't 'tough enough.' This shows how all of us are trained to fit into a box by society rewarding certain kinds of behaviors and punishing others.
- Putting people into boxes and creating expectations about how they should navigate the world harms them and could lead to forms of violence and discrimination that affect everyone.

## Closing Statements

- We can think of these gender-related pressures or expectations as a box that restricts you from freely expressing who you are.
- The attitudes and behaviors that society pressures us to ascribe to have a big impact on us and others. For example, most boys and men feel the pressure to be brave and not back down from a challenge, even if they know it's a dumb or risky decision Depending on what the challenge is, this can result in things like alcohol or drug overdose, car accidents, or physical or mental injuries.

## INSTRUCTIONS

## SUPPORT SHEET #3.3.1 Gender Boxes Handout

Think about what mesages you've received about your gender throughout your life. Today, we are going to explore the ditterent expectations society places on each of us based on how we are perceived. There are many parts of someone's identity (race, wealth, nationality, body size, etc.), so you can write about those as well and see how they all interact with your gender . This worksheet will not be shared with others. When the group debriefs, you do not have to share any information you are not comfortable sharing.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## VISUAL VOICES

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Young people will identify at least one progressive message about themselves that they want to embrace.
- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.

## Procedure INDIVIDUAL WORK

12 Minutes

<!-- image -->

- Warm up the young people and have them get comfortable drawing by doing a 'blind drawing.' Give young people a piece of regular, blank paper and have them draw based on the facilitator's instruction without looking at their papers. 1
- Tell the young people to not look at the paper during this warm-up. Then, SAY: 2
- a. Draw a road. Now, draw a stop sign at the end of the road.
- b. Go up and draw a sun, and then go down and draw a home.
- c. Go draw birds in the sky. Go back to the house and draw some windows.
- Have young people show each other their art. Explain that even when they can't draw 'well,' they are still able to convey their message through art. This can help relieve some of the anxiety about making 'good art.' 3
- Pass out a piece of flipchart (or other large) paper to all young people. 4
- After the young people are comfortable, say that you want them to draw or write about 'what it means to be you.' Encourage the young people to think about the different facets of their identity What does their race/ethnicity mean to them (e.g., what does it mean to be a Black boy/man)? How can they depict their relationship with religion or to family/community (e.g., what does it mean to be an only child/have many siblings)? What do they enjoy doing, and what makes them unique (e.g., what does it mean to be a theater actor)? Encourage drawing, but if young people want to just write, that's okay. 5
- Have young people begin. As they draw, go around asking about what they are drawing and probing to try to help those who are having a tough time. 6

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

With a group that shares a common identity (Black, Latinx, Catholic, male, etc.), it has worked well to have everyone think about what it means to be that one identity. Therefore, the young people can share their interpretations and compare around a common theme while also identifying differences and intersections within the group (by gender, age, ability, etc.).

## PRESENTATIONS

8 Minutes

<!-- image -->

- Ask each participant to present their poster one by one. ASK the group to reflect on each poster, including any observations about colors, words, anything different or unique, and so on. Encourage the group to look at themes and to ask why the creator chose to put certain words or pictures on their poster. After each poster is presented, make sure everyone claps to recognize the work. 7
- After all posters are reviewed, ask young people to share what they learned or experienced from this activity. Were there any common themes they saw among the group? What did this exercise teach them about their community? 8
- Ask if they would have created a different poster if the prompt had been about what it means to be a man or woman instead of what it means to be them specifically. Why might those posters have been different? 9
- Each of us has unique characteristics that make us who we are. No two people are exactly the same.
- Self-confidence can take time to develop. You all have at least one positive trait that you can focus on.
- It is also important to reflect on the parts of ourselves that we don't like as much. This helps us grow into the people that we want to become.

## IMPORTANT

Make sure young people have a sheet with local resources and review with young people how to reach you with questions or to discuss any topics that came up in the session in greater depth.

## GENDER IN TRADITIONS

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Objective

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

- Procedure
- Young people will reflect on the gendered aspects of traditions within their communities.
- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.

<!-- image -->

1

Ask the young people to identify traditions and practices (e.g., holidays, celebrations) that have expectations related to gender identity, expression, and/or sexual orientation.

- a. If the group has difficulties providing examples of such traditions and practices, explain that they can think of practices related to dating, marriage, funerals, holidays, cookouts, and so on. They can also think about what families expect from young people of different genders.
- b. Write the answers on a flipchart paper, separating the different categories of traditions and practices.
3. Divide the young people into two groups and give each group a portion of the traditions/practices. 2
4. Say that each group will have 15 minutes to discuss the assigned traditions/practices, thinking about how traditions and practices impact men, women, boys, and girls differently in the community; the risks of these traditions and practices leading to violence; and the obstacles they could create for positive behavioral changes. Each group should also review strategies to transform these traditions and practices. 3
5. After 15 minutes , ask the young people to return to the circle and start the discussion using the following questions. 4

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Closing Statements

- How do some traditions and cultural practices you mentioned affect men and women differently?
- How do these traditions and practices constitute forms of violence against women, girls, boys, and men? How can we transform these traditions and cultural practices to break the cycle of violence?
- How can you engage other young women and men and adolescent girls and boys in transforming these cultural norms and practices?
- Are there examples of cultural norms and traditions that celebrate gender equity? Racial equity?
- We should not continue traditions and practices that are harmful to ourselves or others. Just because something has always been done that way does not mean it has to continue to be done that way.

## EXPRESSING MY EMOTIONS

(Virtual adaptation available in Annex E)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Objective
- Young people will discuss how sometimes emotions (and expressing emotions) can be a gendered concept when, in fact, everyone shares these emotions.
- Young people will be able to better articulate their emotions beyond their current comfort level and in a way that is not harmful to themselves or others.
- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Create a poll for ranking these emotions using https://www.mentimeter.com/:
- Fear, Affection, Sadness, Happiness, and Anger

## RANKING EMOTIONS

5 Minutes

<!-- image -->

- Remind young people about how we talked about the connections between showing or not showing emotions and the messages we receive about gender. To refresh the group, ask how emotion is connected to the 'Gender Boxes.' 1
- Share your screen and go to https://www.mentimeter.com/, where you have set up the poll. In the chat, share www.menti.com and the code for them to participate in the poll. 2
- Explain: 3
- a. We will be thinking about and discussing how easy or difficult it is for people to express various emotions. You should rank these emotions from the easiest to express to what is most difficult.
- b. The emotions ranked first and second are the ones we have often learned to express in an exaggerated way (or learned to express very well).
- c. Numbers four and five are those we haven't learned to express as well, or that we may have learned to repress or keep hidden.
- d. Number three may represent an emotion we do not exaggerate or repress but probably deal with more naturally.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Conduct the poll and display the results. 4
- With the entire group, reflect on the similarities and differences found among the young people. 5
- Explain that there are many different types of emotions beyond the ones listed. Provide examples of the range of emotions available to people (referring back to the 'Museum of Feelings' support sheet in Session 1). Encourage young people to name how they're feeling as specifically as possible. 6

## NAMING YOUR OWN EMOTIONS

10 Minutes

<!-- image -->

- Explain that while the previously mentioned five emotions are some of the most important and recognizable, they do not account for every emotion someone might experience. 7
- Share Support Sheet #4.2.1 and ask them to review it. Alternatively, distribute the 'Museum of Feelings' again from Activity 1.3. 8
- Direct the young people to use the list to identify two emotions they've experienced at the same time and give them a funny combination of names. Give them about four minutes; then, ask them to create another pair. 9
- a. If they have trouble, give this example: 'anxstatic' (ecstatic + anxious) - happy about some sort of outcome while also itching for the next step.
- Instruct them to think of a story for each pair, as well as an emoji that might reflect the pair. Ask for everyone who feels comfortable to share their pairs and stories with the group. 10

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

In this activity, be sure to ask all questions.

- Why do people exaggerate or hide certain emotions?
- How do they learn to do this?
- What are the consequences of exaggerating or hiding emotions?
- What are the differences between how men and women are 'supposed to' express emotions?
- Why are emotions important? (Examples: Fear helps us handle dangerous situations; anger helps us to defend ourselves. Ask the young people for examples.)
- What types of emotions do you feel 'safe' showing when you are hanging out with friends or in your neighborhood? Why do these emotions feel safer to show than others?

## Closing Statements

- How do you think expressing your feelings more openly can affect your wellbeing?
- Your relationships with other people (romantic partners, family, friends, etc.)?
- What can you do to express your emotions more openly?
- You shouldn't feel ashamed to express your emotions even if it may be difficult.
- Expressing them, without causing harm to others, helps make you stronger and relate better to the world around you.
- It is common for people to hide fear, sadness, or even kindness - and to express anger through violence. We can change this.
- While this activity explains emotions in a straightforward manner, in reality, emotions are very complex. As we saw in the second part of the activity, one can experience multiple emotions at the same time. There is nothing wrong with having complex emotions, and it's important for us to try and remove the stigma of being 'too emotional.'
- Although you are not responsible for feeling certain emotions, you are responsible for what you do with what you feel. It is critical to distinguish between 'feeling' and 'acting' to find forms of expression that do not cause damage to yourselves or to others.

- Using the information on the flipchart as a starting point, lead a discussion about what power is and what it means to young people. 6
- What kinds of situations make us feel powerful? Powerless?
- Is power something that you can have on your own or something you only have in relation to someone else?
- Are we always in situations where someone has power?
- How do gender roles and norms affect the power that people experience?
- How does having or not having power make you feel?
- What are the different types of power that we know?

<!-- image -->

## Closing Statements

- We can use our power to lift others up or to tear others down. When you are in positions of power, consider how others in that situation may be feeling.
- You have the power to control your own thinking and emotions. Don't let others take that power away from you.

## SUPPORT SHEET #4.3.1 Understanding Power

| POWER ONL EXISTS IN RELATION TO OTHER PEOPLE OR RESOURCES   | We only have or do not have powerin relation to somebody else or another group that has more, les, or thesameamountofpowerwe do. It is a relationship.                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POWER IS NOT FIXED                                          | It is not something wearebornwithoralways have all the time. We are constantly moving in and out of situations and relationshipswherewe have moreorles power.                                          |
| POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FEELINGS                              | We often feel positive and in control whenwearefeeling powerful and have negative feelings whenwearefeeling les powerful. This attects our ability to inGLYPH<30>uence and take action in a situation. |

## THERE ARE DIFERENT TYPES OF POWER WHICH CAN BE USED IN DIFERENT WAYS.

## These are:

-  Power over: This means having control over somebody or a situation in a negative way, usually asociated with represion, force, corruption, discrimination, and abuse. This kind of power is taking it from somebody else and then using it to dominate and prevent others from taking it - a win-lose situation.
- Power with: This is having power on the basis of collective strength and/ or numbers - having power with people or groups to GLYPH&lt;29&gt;nd common ground among ditterent interests and to build a common goal to bene GLYPH&lt;29&gt;t all those in the collective. This power multiplies individual talents and knowledge and is based on support, solidarity, and collaboration.
- Power to: This kind of power refers to the ability to shape and inGLYPH&lt;30&gt;uence one's life. It refers to having the ideas, knowledge, skills, money, and ability to convince yourself and others to do something. With lots of people with this kind of power, we create 'power with' (see above).
- Power within: This kind of power is related to a person's feeling of self-worth and self-knowledge. It is related to the ability a person has to imagine a beGLYPH&lt;28&gt;er life for themselves and to have hope and the sense that they can change the world. It is the feeling that they have rights as human beings - having a sense of self-conGLYPH&lt;29&gt;dence and a feeling that they have value because they exist.

## DEALING WITH DISEMPOWERMENT

(Virtual adaptation available in Annex E)

<!-- image -->

Objective

<!-- image -->

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

## Procedure

- Young people will discuss different coping mechanisms that young people use and be able to distinguish negative coping strategies from positive ones.
- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Label three boxes as follows:

POWERLESS BOX

ANGER BOX

FEAR &amp; GUILT BOX

- Divide a piece of flipchart paper into two columns: 'Positive' and 'Negative'

## POSITIVE

## NEGATIVE

- Write out the following on another flipchart sheet titled 'Responding to Negative Emotions'
- Acting out: Revenge and fighting others
- Communicating and sharing with others
- Expressing emotions physically and relaxing
- Trying to forget and avoid the emotions

## Begin the activity by ASKING

- a. Do you sometimes feel powerlessness, shame, or guilt?
- b. What makes you feel like that?
- c. How do you deal with those feelings?
4. After about five minutes, break the young people into groups of three. Give each group several pieces of small paper. 2

<!-- image -->

1

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

- Say that the groups will be discussing the following questions: 3
- a. What do you do when you feel powerless?
- b. What do you do when you feel anger, hate, or aggression?
- c. What do you do when you feel injured, shame, or guilt?
- Say that they should write down what they do when feeling that emotion and place it into the corresponding box (powerless, anger, fear and guilt). 4

## You won't do anything with the boxes right away, but keep them handy.

- Have young people write down the actions. When they have finished, have them come back to the large group and sit in a circle. Lead them into a group discussion of the following questions: 5
- a. How are you doing?
- b. What were your thoughts and feelings while doing this exercise?
- c. Was it easy or difficult to find examples?
- d. What examples from your discussions would you like to share?

## SAY

- a. Nobody can avoid having problems during their lives. When facing difficulties, we respond with emotions: feeling angry, sad, frustrated, scared, and so on. Emotions are expressions of what we feel. Negative experiences may trigger negative emotions.
- b. Negative emotions are important and not 'wrong': Negative emotions should not be confused with 'wrong' emotions. Feeling anger, frustration, guilt, and so on is not wrong. It may be appropriate and normal to feel angry when someone hurts you. What is important is the way you deal with the experience and emotion.
- c.  Anger or aggression is an important emotion if it is used in constructive ways. Wanting to win the game, pass your exams, and climb a mountain are examples of when we need our capacity to mobilize aggression. However, aggression can also be used in destructive ways when directed toward destroying others or yourself.
4. Explain that when you become angry, you have several ways to express that anger through actions and behaviors. In general, there are four types of behaviors in responding to 'negative emotions' (emotions that don't feel good but are relevant). Refer to the flipchart paper and ask them to think of examples for each type: 7

## a. Acting out: Revenge and fighting others

- Fighting with the person hurting you
- Fighting with other people who remind you of them/the situation
- Seeking excitement through different risky behaviors (gangs, driving fast, criminal activities, harassing others, etc.)

6

FACILITATOR'S NOTE

## b. Communicating and sharing with others

- Talking to a good friend/person of trust about what happened
- Asking for support from peers, mentors, counselors, parents, etc.
- Talking at a quiet moment to the person that hurt you

## c. Expressing emotions physically and relaxing

- Playing sports (e.g., playing football and expressing tension and frustration in hitting the ball)
- Watching football (screaming as expression)
- Playing games
- Playing music, singing
- Praying, meditation

## d. Trying to forget and avoid the emotions

- Drinking alcohol, taking drugs to forget
- Isolating and punishing yourself in thoughts (e.g., all people are against me, all people are bad, life has no meaning, feeling depressed, suicidal thoughts)
- Explain that some emotions may be easy to recognize and express, while others may be very hard to recognize and express to others. While young people have the same feelings and emotions, they may express them in different ways because they are taught to do so. (Refer back to the 'gender boxes' as much as possible.) 8

## ASK : 9 ?

- a. What differences do you see between young men and young women in dealing with negative emotions?
2. Analyze the examples in the boxes on the type of behavior: 10
- a. Take the papers out of the three boxes, and read them out loud. Have the young people determine if they are positive or negative ways of dealing with the problem/emotion. Use the table on the prepared 'Positive/Negative' flipchart to analyze whether the responses are positive or negative.
- b. After you have read all of the pieces of paper, brainstorm by asking: What are some more positive coping mechanisms that we can use when we feel powerless or hurt? Examples can include:
- Physical exercise, sports
- Creating music
- Reading books, watching movies, playing games
- Praying, meditation, hiking, yoga, watching sports/football
- Talking with friends, mentors, peers, parents, or siblings
- Talking to a counselor or therapist

Make sure that the young people provide examples that make sense for them.

## Closing Statements

- Emotions are normal reactions to experiences.
- Negative emotions don't feel good but are important to recognize and acknowledge. Negative experiences affect our psychosocial well-being, feelings about ourselves, and relationships with others. It is normal to respond to such experiences with healthy coping - behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that help us to adapt and integrate the experience into our lives.
- Knowing yourself well, knowing how problems and emotions shape your behaviors, helps to respond in positive and constructive ways to negative experiences.

## IMPORTANT

Make sure young people have a sheet with local resources and review with young people how to reach you with questions or to discuss any topics that came up in the session in greater depth.

<!-- image -->

## Objective

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

## Procedure

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

<!-- image -->

Young people will understand the existence of power in relationships and reflect on how we communicate and demonstrate power in relationships.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.

1

Divide the young people into two groups, with each group forming a line facing the other group (with an imaginary boundary in the center). Each side should have the same number of young people, and each participant should have a partner on the other side.

- Tell the young people that the name of this activity is 'People and Things.' Randomly choose one group to be 'things' and one group to be 'people.' 2
- Read the following directions to the group: 3

## a. THINGS

You cannot think, feel, or make decisions. You have to do what the 'people' tell you to do. If you want to move or do something, you have to ask the 'people' for permission.

## b . PEOPLE

You can think, feel, and make decisions. Furthermore, you can tell the 'things' what to do.

At this point in the activity, it might be helpful to ask for two volunteers to act out for the group how a 'person' might treat a 'thing'; you can also give an example, such as, 'A 'person' can request that a 'thing' jog in place' or, 'A 'person' can request that a 'thing' conduct all activities with one hand behind their back.'

<!-- image -->

## Group Discussion

<!-- image -->

## Session 5 Balancing Power Activity 5.2

- Ask the 'people' to begin the activity, instructing that they can order the 'things' to do any kind of activity. (Alternatively, the 'people' can direct the 'things' with hand gestures, using their hands to show they must move ahead or back, move up and down or jump, or move to one side or twirl around.) 4
- Give the groups two minutes for the 'things' to carry out the designated roles. 5
- Finally, ask the young people to go back to their places in the room and use the following questions to facilitate a discussion. 6
- For the 'things,' how did your 'people' treat you? What did you feel? Why? Would you have liked to have been treated differently?
- For the 'people,' how did you treat your 'things'? How did it feel to treat someone as an object?
- Why did the 'things' obey the instructions given by the 'people'?
- Can you think of relationships in our daily lives where someone treats another person like a 'thing'?
- What about in history? What examples can you think of where people were treated like 'things'?
- In your daily life, do you treat others like 'things?' Who? Why?
- Why do people treat each other like this?
- What are the consequences of a relationship in which one person treats another like a 'thing'?
- How can power or using power be positive? That is, what are some positive ways we can use power?
- How does society or culture perpetuate or support these kinds of relationships, in which some people have power over others?
- Are there particular groups in society that tend to have more power than others?
- How can this activity help you think about (and perhaps make) changes in your own relationships?
- There are many different types of relationships in which one person might have power over another.
- As we discuss relationships between young people (including intimate relationships), it is important to remember the connection between how you

PRACTICING SELF-DETERMINATION 50 Minutes

<!-- image -->

## Objective

## FACILITATOR'S

## NOTE

<!-- image -->

Young people will develop the skills needed to make life choices without being significantly influenced by a another person.

This activity can be particularly triggering for young people who have experienced boundary transgressions. It is critical to start the activity by noting that although the focus is on self-determination and thinking about our boundaries, we also know that there are survivors in the room who have already experienced people hurting and harming them. These kinds of experiences are NEVER the survivor's fault. We are all in Creating Peace to create a safer community for everyone. Knowing that we can create boundaries is also part of healing and recovery.

Consider a script like this: 'This next activity can be hard for some of us in the room who have already been hurt or harmed by others. We do this activity to remind ourselves that strengthening our boundaries is an important part of our healing. We are building our inner strength. And when we do experience harm or hurt because someone ignored our boundaries, it is never our fault. And we are not alone.'

might feel oppressed - or treated like 'objects' - in some of your relationships and how you, in turn, might treat others (including women) like 'objects.'

- Thinking about these connections can help motivate you to construct more equitable relationships with those people in your homes, schools, and communities.

## Procedure

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Print 1 copy of Support Sheet #5.3.1
- On a flipchart paper, write the following sentence template

- I feel

- when

- because                                               .

- I would like                                         .

1

## Introduce the activity by SAYING:

<!-- image -->

- a. Because we just shared many experiences related to our feelings when we were treated as objects, were abused, or saw other people use violence, it is important that we create strategies together to prevent people making us feel uncomfortable or harmed.
- b. The purpose of this activity is to think about how we can not only make healthy choices for ourselves but also positively influence the people around us.
- c. We can do this by setting boundaries through using I Statements, which we will go over during today's session.

Tell the group the core purpose(s) and activities of today's session (listed on the previous page).

## Ask the group 2

- a. We are going to spend some time talking about boundaries, both physical and emotional. What is a boundary?

Answer: Boundaries are the invisible lines we set between ourselves and others as a way to protect ourselves, take care of ourselves, and honor what we need or believe. Boundaries often move and change over time or in different situations.

Naming and honoring our boundaries take time and effort. First, we need to examine our own limits, and second, we need to know how to communicate them directly to others. When we practice this regularly, it actually helps prevent miscommunication, misunderstanding, and/or resentment. Boundaries can - and should - be set with anyone that you have relationships with.

- b. What is one boundary you might set in a romantic or sexual relationship?

Possible categories: Physical, sexual, time, technology, material.

- c. We commonly talk about setting boundaries with romantic partners but what's a boundary you can set with your teachers? Parents? Or friends?
2. Transition to discussing ways that you can express your boundaries by using something called an 'I Statement'. 3

<!-- image -->

- Present the 'I' statement model (referring to the flipchart paper) and SAY: 4

a. One thing that we may find helpful is to use 'I' statements like the one on this flipchart paper. You start with expressing what you are feeling. It's probably best not to say 'angry' but instead dig deeper under the surface and communicate that. Next, you'll give a specific example of when and what made you feel that way. It's important to say the reason because it might make more sense to the other person in the situation. Finally, you end with a proposal of what you would like to happen. This is where boundaries come in. What is the boundary that you're trying to communicate? This model is not meant to be prescriptive, but it gives you the pieces of the puzzle for healthy communication.

5

SAY:

- a. Here are some examples of what 'you' statements could look like. As I read these out one by one, raise your hand and help me change this to an 'I' statement format using the flipchart as a guide.

## Group Discussion

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

## ASK 6 ?

- a. What are important things to remember when receiving these messages yourself? How can you show the other person you are actively listening to them?

Possible answers : Don't be defensive; don't interrupt; use active listening; be empathetic.

- SAY 7
- a. Now, we are going to look at some different situations and talk about how you could go about setting healthy boundaries with those around you.
- Split the participants into four groups. Hand out one of the 'Boundary Scenarios' (Support Sheet #5.3.1) to each of the groups. 8
- SAY 9
- a. In your groups, I want you to read the scenario and take 5 minutes to discuss how you would go about setting this boundary. What steps would you take, and what would you say using the 'I Statement' framework we just discussed? After the 5 minutes, we will come together to discuss.
- Clarify the directions as needed. 10
- After 5 minutes, give each of the groups 2-3 minutes to present their answer and open for a short discussion. 11
- Do you think it's easy for young people to set boundaries? Why or why not?
- How might gender expectations and roles play into someone's ability to express and maintain boundaries?
- As friends and community members, how can we help each other protect these boundaries? (They should think back to Activities 2.3 and 2.4 - their circles of influence and support networks.)

Remember that this activity may be particularly triggering for young people who have experienced abuse. State again clearly to the young people that we know there are survivors in the room who have already experienced people hurting and harming them. These kinds of experiences are NEVER the survivor's fault. We are proud of the courage it takes to come to Creating Peace. No one is ever alone. We are here for each other.

## (Optional) Homework Assignment

<!-- image -->

## Closing Statements

- Ask young people to reflect on today's session by writing down in a journal what sort of boundaries they wish to set for themselves in the future.
- It is important to make healthy choices for ourselves and be a positive influence on others. We can continue to identify ways to protect ourselves from those who are trying to harm us and ignore our privacy. We also have a responsibility to ask our friends, peers, and those we care about for permission to do things to them, like asking for permission to give them a hug.
-  Boundaries are the invisible lines we set between ourselves and others as a way to protect ourselves, take care of ourselves, and honor what we need or believe. Boundaries often move and change over time or in different situations. This is normal.

## IMPORTANT

Make sure young people have a sheet with local resources and review with young people how to reach you with questions or to discuss any topics that came up in the session in greater depth.

## HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS

(Virtual adaptation available in Annex E)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Young people will identify healthy and unhealthy relationship situations, identify the key aspects of sustaining a healthy relationship, and define 'dealbreaker' moments where the relationship should end.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- /.notdef- Write the following 'Relationship Range' categories in large letters on separate pieces of paper: 'Healthy,' 'Unhealthy,' and 'Depends.'
- /.notdefWrite each of the following 'Relationship Situations' on a separate piece of letter-sized paper or index card:
- The most important thing in the relationship is sex.
- You spend some time by yourself without your partner.
- You have fun being with your partner.
- Your friend is constantly making fun of you in front of others.
- Your friend only reaches out to you to ask for money or a favor. /.notdef
- You make your partner feel guilty for not wanting to have a baby with you.
- You usually make every decision for the couple.
- You stay in the relationship because it is better than being alone.
- You are in control of yourself and able to make your own decisions.
- You talk about problems when they arise in the relationship.
- You argue or fight almost every day.
- Your partner forces you to have sex when you don't want to.
- Alcohol and drugs play a major role in your friendship.
- Your friend is always available for you to vent your problems to.
- You ask your partner for their social media passwords.
- You give your partner the silent treatment after they look at other women or men.
- You have a friend spy on your partner.
- You pressure your partner to not use any form of birth control when you are having sex.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- You ask your friend to break rules made by their parents.
- You keep your word.
- Your sibling tells you to sneak out of the house with them.
- Your friend wants you to do well in school.
- On a flipchart paper in front of the group, write 'Healthy' on the left side and 'Unhealthy' on the right. ( Facilitator's Note: This is different from the 'Relationship Range' in the preparation section). Explain that these are two types of relationships that will be explored today. 1
- Ask the group to define healthy and unhealthy romantic relationships by brainstorming words in the two categories that help describe them. Your flipchart may look like this: 2
- Place the list of healthy and unhealthy characteristics aside, and be prepared to revisit it later in the activity. 3
- Explain that young people are going to look further into what is a healthy or unhealthy relationship. 4
- At the top of a large wall or chalkboard, place the three relationship cards apart from each other, with 'Healthy' on the left, 'Depends' in the middle, and 'Unhealthy' on the right. 5
- Hand out two notecards to each participant. Tell them to write down a healthy scenario on one card and an unhealthy scenario on the other. These can be made up, something they've seen or heard, or something that's happened to them. 6
- When they have finished writing, have the young people hand in their cards and shuffle them. 7

| HEALTHY       | UNHEALTHY                    |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| Honest        | Lying                        |
| Communication | Poor communication           |
| Equality      | Domination                   |
| Respect       | Being dismissive, belittling |
| Trust         | Mistrust                     |

<!-- image -->

## Group Discussion

- Then, hand the cards out to different young people and tell them to place the cards in the column they think the situation should be in: 'Healthy,' 'Depends,' or 'Unhealthy.' If you do not have enough scenarios or variety, you should then hand out the example situations you have written up before the session. 8
- After all of the 'Relationship Situation' cards have been placed, ask the group what they think about the placements. Review each situation one by one, allowing time for discussion. If they don't agree, remind them of the qualities of a healthy relationship (communication, respect, equality, responsibility, and honesty). Ask them if the situation shows these qualities, and move the situation to the appropriate column. 9
- Ask young people to come up with some other scenarios that might be considered unhealthy or healthy. These scenarios can be for romantic or platonic relationships. Ask them to think about the power dynamics in the relationships. 10
- Is being in a relationship a barrier or an opportunity? Why or why not?
- What, to you, are the most important things in a relationship? Is this different for everyone?
- What are some challenges or barriers to building the types of relationship we want? To building healthy, equitable relationships?
- What are some of the consequences of being in an unhealthy relationship for you? For your relationships with others?
- How can we address situations when our and our partners' priorities are different?
- What role does trust play? How do we build that?
- What happens when we feel like we can't trust our partner?
- What are ways to build better communication or trust? What is our role in doing that?
- Do we have the same standards for romantic relationships as we do for friendships? Why or why not?
- Do we have the same standards for friendships that we do for family relationships? Why or why not?
- Do we have the same standards for work relationships? Why or why not?

## EXPLORING SEXUAL CONSENT

<!-- image -->

## Objective

<!-- image -->

## Preparation

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

<!-- image -->

Young people will clearly define sexual consent, apply the definition to reallife situations, and understand the gender dynamics that may come into play when dealing with consent.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- /.notdef- On index cards, write each of the scenarios from Support Sheet #6.3.1 in large font. Alternatively, you can print out the sheet and cut the scenarios into strips.

This activity can be particularly triggering for young people who have experienced boundary transgressions. It is critical to start the activity by noting that although the focus is on self-determination and thinking about our boundaries, we also know that there are survivors in the room who have already experienced people hurting and harming them. These kinds of experiences are NEVER the survivor's fault. We are all in Creating Peace to create a safer community for everyone. Knowing that we can create boundaries is also part of healing and recovery.

Consider a script like this: 'This next activity can be hard for some of us in the room who have already been hurt or harmed by others. We do

- It is okay to end a relationship because it is unhealthy, whether it is a friendship or romantic relationship.
- It's important to remember what makes a relationship strong - mainly honesty, communication, equality, respect, and trust.  We should all strive to bring those to various relationships and demand that in return.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Procedure

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

this activity to remind ourselves that strengthening our boundaries is an important part of our healing. We are building our inner strength. And when we do experience harm or hurt because someone ignored our boundaries, it is never our fault. And we are not alone.'

You should also refer young people to the resources available to them for confidential discussions.

## INTRODUCTION

3

Minutes

<!-- image -->

- Say that two words that often come up when we talk about sexual relationships are 'responsibility' and 'respect.' Both individuals in a relationship have a responsibility not only to set their own sexual limits but also to respect the sexual limits of others. 1
- Write the word 'sexual consent' on flipchart paper, and ask the group to explain what it means and why they think it is important. Write down their responses. 2

It is important for the facilitator to keep the following in mind when having these discussions with young people:

- Consent means checking in and making sure your partner is comfortable.
- Everyone has a choice in what they do and don't do.
- Open communication is important in establishing consent.
- Look at body language - if you aren't sure, just ask.
- Look to establish an enthusiastic yes - sex is more enjoyable when both partners are excited about what they are doing and who they are doing it with.
- Consent cannot be granted if your partner is unconscious or extremely drunk.
- Clarify that 'sexual consent' simply means agreeing to participate in a particular sexual behavior. Both individuals have to agree to do something, and if one person does not want to, they are not giving their consent. This is extremely important because any sexual act without consent is considered sexual assault and is against the law. 3

- If this has not been explicitly stated during the group discussion, write on the flipchart: 4
- a. Sexual consent means that both partners have agreed upon sex and that this agreement is stated either by words or actions without pressure.

## DEFINING SEXUAL COERCION

7

Minutes

<!-- image -->

- Explain that when a person makes someone else feel obligated or forced to do something they don't want to, they may be coercing the other person. Ask young people for some examples of this when it comes to sex. Some examples are: 5
- a. They make you feel like you owe them sex - for example, because you're in a relationship, you've had sex before, they spent money on you or bought you a gift, or you went home with them.
- b. They react negatively (with sadness, anger, or resentment) if you say no or don't agree to something.
- c. They play on the fact that you're in a relationship, saying things such as, 'Sex is the way to prove your love for me' or, 'If I don't get sex from you, I'll get it somewhere else.'
- Explain that sexual coercion is 'the act of using pressure, alcohol or drugs, or force to have sexual contact with someone against his or her will' and includes 'persistent attempts to have sexual contact with someone who has already refused.' 4 6
- Ask the group if they can give some examples or ask if they have questions about what that means. 7
- 8

Explain:

- a. Think of sexual coercion as a spectrum. It can vary from someone verbally pressuring or manipulating you to someone actually physically forcing you to have contact with them.
- b. It can be verbal and emotional, in the form of statements that make you feel pressure, guilt, or shame. A person can also feel forced through more subtle actions.
3. Talk about coercion more broadly. Where else do people feel coerced? 9

## ASKING FOR CONSENT AND CHECKING IN

10

ASK

- a. How can we make sure that our partner wants to have sex and is enjoying it? If they aren't, how can we find out why not?

4. Love is Respect. 2023. What is Sexual Coersion? Available at https://www.loveisrespect.org/resources/what-is-sexual-coercion/

<!-- image -->

15

Minutes

- Say that we've heard that 'no' means 'no,' but sometimes, our partners give us nonverbal signals that show they may not be comfortable or having fun. 11
- On a piece of flipchart paper, 12
- a. Write 'Signals to Check In' at the top of the lefthand column. Ask young people to provide examples of signs that a person may be unsure about having sex, and list them in the column.
- b. Then, write 'Checking In' at the top of the righthand side. Ask young people to list things a person could say or do to check in with their partner and determine if this is something they still want to do. After creating both lists, the flipchart should look something like this:
- Split young people into two groups. Hand each group two of the sexual consent scenarios written on index cards (it is the facilitator's discretion on what 4 scenarios would most resonate with youth). Ask them to first see if consent is possible (i.e., the partner is conscious and able to say 'yes' or 'no'). If so, have them write up a skit for that scenario that shows some ways they can 'check in' with their partner to make sure that they are giving enthusiastic consent. Have them take about five minutes. 13
- Have the groups present their skits. 14

| SIGNALSTOCHECKIN          | CHECKINGIN                                        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Unresponsive bodylanguage | 'Are you okay with this?'                         |
| Being withdrawn           | 'Is this still turning you on?'                   |
| Nervousness               | 'You seemnervous. Are you comfortable with this?' |
| Tears                     | 'I see that you're crying. Let's stop and talk.'  |

## CONSENT BEYOND SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS

10 Minutes

<!-- image -->

- Ask the group if they can think of situations outside of sexual ones where consent could come into play. (If they have trouble, give the example of someone touching another person's hair.) 15

<!-- image -->

ASK

- a. Are there ways to avoid making someone feel uncomfortable or like their personal space is being violated?

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

## Talk about consent more broadly 17

- a. Where else do we expect consent in our lives? Who is allowed to touch, talk about, or share photos of our bodies, even outside sexual contexts?
- b. How does this apply to catcalling?
- c. How does this apply to going to the doctor's office?
- d. How does this apply to greeting your friends in the hallway?

Stress that conversations about consent are not about policing behavior but instead taking ownership over your body. Remind them that their bodies are their own and they can respect their bodies (and other people's bodies) by modeling good consent. 18

<!-- image -->

## ASK

- a. What should consent look like on social media (DMs, Snapchat photos, and so on)?

## Group Discussion

- How was it trying to think of ways to check in with your partner and make sure they were comfortable with the situation?
- What are some of the messages or expectations about sex that young people receive that affect how they vocalize their desires or needs?
- What are some messages we receive about who has ownership over our bodies outside of sexual intimacy? Who is allowed to touch us without asking explicit permission?
- What are some of the fears that young women may have in being strongly vocal about what they do not want?
- What are some fears that other young people may have about being strongly vocal about what they do not want?

This is not an opportunity for people in the room to complain about false rape accusations. If a participant suggests this, ask others if they agree and allow the young people to challenge each other. If no one challenges this idea, see if you can ask probing questions that help them reflect - e.g., 'What are some of the reasons young people may think that?'

- Why is it important to ask for or confirm consent? How can confirming or affirming consent from our partner make sex more fun or enjoyable?
- Why is it important for people to accept 'no' for an answer? Do people always accept 'no'? Why not? What can we do if the other person doesn't accept 'no'?
- How can we apply some of the things we discussed today to our lives?

## Closing Statements

- Harmful messages about masculinity may contribute to pressuring a partner into sexual activity or not accepting a person's decision not to have sex. We should respect every person's right to say no to things that they are uncomfortable doing.
- We all have a right to have ownership over our bodies at all times. You alone know what type of touching, sharing of photos, or talking about your body feels safe or unsafe to you. You should always trust your instincts.
- Although this activity is depicting mostly opposite-sex relationships, these themes apply to all relationships regardless of gender and sexual orientation.
- Consent is not possible if one or both people are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
- The best way to know that you have consent is to talk about it! Ongoing conversation about what a partner is comfortable or uncomfortable doing is an important vehicle for consent.
- While we have all heard that 'no' means 'no,' be open to listening to the silent or unspoken ways that your partner may be communicating that they do not want or feel comfortable engaging in some act. Asking questions and making sure they are OK can build better intimacy between partners.

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

This activity's discussions can be particularly triggering if you have experienced boundary transgressions like the ones we've discussed. There are resources available if you want to speak to someone about your experience. Remember that no one is ever to blame if they were not able to give consent and that the person using violence is the person who needs to be accountable for their actions. Together, we can imagine and create a community where consensual relationships are the norm and violence is never tolerated.

## IMPORTANT

Make sure young people have a sheet with local resources and review with young people how to reach you with questions or to discuss any topics that came up in the session in greater depth.

## SUPPORT SHEET #6.3.1 Sexual Consent Scenarios

- TAYLOR AND ALEX have been married for two years. Sometimes, Taylor gets home late and Alex is already sleeping. Taylor wakes Alex up to have sex. Sometimes, Alex does not want to, but Taylor insists. 1.

- TRACY AND KEITH are planning to get married and have a family together after they finish studying. Keith tells Tracy that he loves her and they should have sex. Tracy has said in the past that she wants to wait until they are married. Keith is not very happy, but he agrees to wait. One day, Tracy says to Keith that she wants to have sex. While they are hooking up, Keith notices that Tracy isn't as enthusiastic as she has been in the past and seems withdrawn. 2.

## EMPATHY CLOTHESLINE

(Virtual adaptation available in Annex E)

<!-- image -->

- Young people will identify the forms of violence that we perpetrate (use) or that are committed against us or surround us, including emotional, physical, and sexual violence.
- Young people will identify ways that the cycle of violence is perpetuated and can be broken.
- Young people will recognize that many of us have been exposed to and perpetrated different forms of violence and abuse and that we can make a change by choosing to be nonviolent.
- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing
- Set up four clotheslines (strings) across the room and put some clothespins on each of them..

1

- Explain that the purpose of this activity is to talk about an important aspect of unhealthy relationships - violence. To do this, we need to remember that this is a safe space where we respect one another and do not share what is said in this group with others.

This activity asks young people to think about personal experiences of violence, including witnessing violence and violence they may have perpetrated. Remind young people that they do not need to disclose anything personal and that if they do (especially if they are minors), facilitators may be required to involve other adult authorities to keep the young person safe. Youth should be reminded that the discussion is anonymous; they should not put their name on the paper/index cards.

Facilitation for this activity should always be done together with someone who has been trained in supporting survivors so that young people have an identified person to talk to if they would like. All young

## Preparation

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

<!-- image -->

people should be given - and reminded how to use - resources relevant to interpersonal violence at the beginning and end of the session. It is important to provide the resources at the beginning in case a young person chooses to leave during the session.

Additionally, when we talk about abuse, violence, and hurting people, we tend to only think of physical aggression, but it is important to think about other forms of violence. It is also essential to help young people think about the acts of violence that they perpetrate because very often we think others are violent but never ourselves.

- Ask young people what comes to mind when they think of the word 'violence.' Write their ideas on a flipchart paper. If they say things like 'physical violence' or 'sexual violence,' ask them for specific examples. 2
- Once you get a long list, explain the following in your own words: At its most basic level, violence is a way to control or have power over another person. People often only think about violence as physical aggression, but there are other forms of violence as well. 3
- Give the definitions of the four types of violence that exist. Link the four types of violence to the examples of violence that young people gave during the initial brainstorm. 4
- a. Physical violence: Using physical force, such as hitting, slapping, kicking, burning, or pushing.
- b. Emotional or psychological violence: Often the most difficult form of violence to identify. It may include humiliating, threatening, insulting, pressuring, and expressions of jealousy or possessiveness, such as controlling decisions and activities. It can also include restricting someone's movements. This form of violence can be verbal or nonverbal.
- c. Sexual violence: Pressuring or forcing someone to perform sexual acts (from kissing to unwanted touching to sex) against their will or making sexual comments that make someone feel humiliated or uncomfortable. It does not matter if the person has previously consented to sexual behavior - consent must be given at the time.
- d. Economic violence: When someone exercises control over another person's money and other economic resources. This type of violence is a way of exerting power and can be used to control someone's movements (for example, keeping them from going to school or interrupting their job).
- Explain that the group will set up four clotheslines and that they will all write a few words on sheets of paper. 5
- Give each participant four sheets of paper. Place on each clothesline the following titles: 6

<!-- image -->

## Group Discussion

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

- a. An example of someone hurting another person
- b. How might someone feel when they are hurt?
- c. How might I feel if I hurt someone?
- d. How might I feel if I am hurt?
5. Ask each participant to think for a while about things they may have seen or heard and to write a short response to each title. Each person should write at least one reply for each clothesline (or category). Allow about ten minutes for this task. Explain that they should not write much, just a few words or a phrase. Remind them not to put their names on the cards. 7
6. Ask the young people to place their cards face down on a table at the front of the room. Shuffle the cards, and begin to place them on the different clotheslines for each of the four categories. 8
7. After all replies are on the clotheslines, allow the group to walk around and read all of the responses. 9
- What are the most common ways we hurt one another?
- How do we feel when someone uses violence against us?
10. /.notdef - How do we feel when we use violence against other people?
- What does it feel like when we've been hurt by someone we're in a sexual or romantic relationship with? How is this different than if it's someone we're just friends or have a casual relationship with?
- How does the media (music, radio, movies, pornography, etc.) portray some of the violence we've talked about?
- How do racism and other kinds of discrimination show up in violence that you have seen people use against others?
- Some researchers say that violence is cyclical - that is, if we experience violence, we are more likely to use violence against others. What do you think about this? Where might we see cycles of violence occurring - in our community? In our neighborhood?
- How do we assess whether a relationship is healthy and walk away from one that we don't find healthy? Why would someone stay in an unhealthy relationship?
- What role do you play in preventing this cycle of violence?
- What have you learned in this activity to help overcome violence?

If anyone in the group shows a need for special attention based on something said during the discussion, ensure that you as the facilitator bring the young person to meet with one of the site leads (at the agency where the program is being held). Ensure the young person knows

## Objective

Preparation

<!-- image -->

Young people will be able to develop and use safe and effective outcome-based interventions to prevent and interrupt sexist behaviors, violence, and conflict in school and community settings.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Think about how you would answer the question posed in the 'Giving and Receiving Constructive Feedback' exercise so that you can share your own experience with young people.

where to get help, consider referring them to appropriate services, and discuss the issue with other senior staff at your organization (see the 'Facilitator's Guide'). Facilitators should adhere to mandatory reporting requirements as specified by their agency or organization.

- There are many ways that people can be hurtful toward others. This can include physical as well as verbal and emotional ways of hurting each other. Hurting others in these ways is a form of violence.
- Violence is often passed from person to person. Someone who has been hurt is more likely to hurt others later because of the pain they feel. This does not mean that violence will definitely take place, but just that it might. Recognizing the hurt and finding support for pain are some of the ways to stop this from happening.
- We have the opportunity here to break the cycle of violence that we experience and to prevent that cycle from passing on to others.

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

<!-- image -->

## Minutes GIVING AND RECEIVING CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK

- Use scissors to cut out each of the four scenarios on Support Sheet #7.3.1 so they are on separate sheets of paper.

Often, when individuals see someone else doing something wrong or harmful, they react in one of two ways: silence or anger/violence. One of the main goals of this exercise is to help the young people move beyond this and think - based on their own experience - of how they can challenge harmful behaviors in ways that are constructive, effective, safe, and supportive.

Responding with anger and violence often feels emotionally satisfying, but it is almost guaranteed to produce a negative reaction and possibly even escalate the confrontation. This exercise encourages young people to think about how to de-escalate the situation as the first step in challenging the harmful behavior.

<!-- image -->

- Ask young people the following question and say their answers will relate to the next exercise: 1
- a. When you have done something wrong or made a mistake, such as something that hurts another person or leads to conflict in your family, how would you prefer that people let you know?
- Write young people's answers on a flipchart paper. Possible responses include the following (if some of these are not mentioned, feel free to bring them up for discussion): 2
- a. I prefer that someone takes me aside after it happens and speaks to me privately instead of embarrassing me in front of the whole community.
- b. I prefer constructive criticism telling me what I can do better rather than just attacking me for what I did wrong.
- c. I think it is more effective when the critic is focused on the behavior and not making personal attacks on my character.
- d. I like it when someone explains why the behavior is wrong so I understand it rather than just saying it is wrong.
- After you have made a list, thank the young people for sharing their personal experiences. Say that as they complete the next exercise, they should keep in mind what they have learned about themselves and each other during this brainstorm. 3

## 25 Minutes INTERVENING TO PREVENT SEXISM AND VIOLENCE

<!-- image -->

- Divide the young people into groups of four or five, giving each group one of the scenarios on Support Sheet #7.3.1. 4
- Instruct young people to read the scenario out loud in their group and then develop a short skit in which they demonstrate the sexism or violence in the scenario, as well as one or more interventions that young people like themselves could use to stop the negative action. 5
- a. They should think about how the intervention can be effective and safe, as well as prevent future violence.
- b. They should also keep in mind their brainstorming in the first part of this activity about how they like to be confronted when they have made a mistake or done something wrong.
- After groups develop their skits, have them perform. After each group performs its skit: 6
- a. Ask the larger group to describe the intervention(s) that they saw used. Keep a list of the interventions on the flipchart for a discussion after all the groups have presented.
- b. If some interventions seem likely to escalate or inflame the situation, ask if there are any disadvantages the larger group could see from using that particular approach.
- c. Also ask the performers why they chose the intervention(s) they did and why they thought they would be effective.
- d. Ask the larger group if they would really be comfortable enough to carry out the bystander behavior modeled in the skit. If not, ask them to consider what they would be comfortable doing. If it isn't direct engagement, perhaps it is telling a parent, teacher, or friend.
- e. Ask the larger group to consider: What would be different in the scenario if the person witnessing the harmful behavior was a young person with a disability? A young person who is an immigrant?
- By the end of all the performances, you should have a list of ways to challenge violent behavior. Highlight for the group that no matter what the situation, there are always many ways one might intervene. 7
- Explain that there are four ways to intervene or 'stand up': direct approach, team up, distract, and call an authority. What are some examples of each? If young people have trouble coming up with their own examples, provide the following: 8

## a. Direct Approach:

- Calmly ask the person to explain their actions and why they are engaging in the negative behavior. Pose questions and ask for clarification about what they are doing and why in a nonconfrontational way that helps to change the dynamic and

also may help the person realize what they are doing is a problem.

- Educate the person about the possible consequences of their actions, as well as the harm they could inflict on the victim(s) and even on themselves.
- Suggest alternative actions that can accomplish the same goal but will provide better outcomes.
- Speak from a perspective of friendship, and begin with your concern for the person. For instance, say that you do not want them to get in trouble with teachers or the police and that you think they are a better person than what their actions may suggest to others.
- Speak from your own perspective. Rather than saying, 'You shouldn't do that,' use 'I' statements and explain how you feel about the person's actions, how they may bother you, or why you feel they are harmful. This method feels much less accusatory for the person being confronted.

## b. Team Up

- If you do not know the person well, if you think they may respond with violence or hostility, or if you think they will not be convinced by just one person, recruit other young people from this group (or others from the community) to speak with them. Perhaps include someone whose opinion they value, such as a friend, relative, elder, or community leader.

## c. Distract

- Compliment or highlight something the person has done well or that you admire before bringing up what they have done wrong.
- If all else fails, try distraction. Some situations are not the time or place for education, but you can interrupt to ask for the time or directions, thus breaking the dynamic of someone using violence or sexism and possibly giving the person being targeted a chance to leave.

## d. Call an Authority

- Depending where you are, find someone with authority or call the police to intervene.

## Also explain things not to do: 9

- a. Never react with violence or too much force or with shouting and anger. This is likely to escalate the situation, making it more dangerous for everyone
- b. If you fear that the person will use physical violence against you as well, then do not intervene alone. Instead, immediately alert the police or ask others in the community to help also.
- c. Your first concern is the health and safety of the person who has been attacked. If it is necessary to keep the victim safe, then let the

## Closing Statements

other person leave the scene while you stay with the person who was being harmed.

- How did it feel to come up with these scenarios? Were they easy or hard?
- Why might someone be afraid to intervene in a situation of violence or conflict?
- Why might someone feel able to intervene in such a situation?
- What are some ways that we can support ourselves and others to intervene in situations of violence or harassment?
- Who is more likely to intervene in situations? An older man? A younger man? A woman? Why might that be?
- Do young people feel comfortable or prepared to intervene in situations of violence or harassment?
- How can we take the techniques we learned today and apply them to our own lives?
- In communities of color, involving police in situations may feel scary. What do we want safer communities to look like?
- /.notdef - There are safe and constructive ways to prevent violence, and these ways differ based on the situation, personal preference, and safety.
- /.notdef - While there is no 'right' way to prevent or respond to violence in every setting, there are many different options, and if you think creatively, you can almost always find something that will work.

## OBSTACLES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL CHANGES

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Preparation

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Young people will determine the strategies needed to overcome the obstacles they face when introducing positive changes in their lives.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- -BIG PREP: Collect/gather flipchart sheets from the previous seven sessions that outline objectives and/or key messages to help the young people remember the content of each of the sessions. (If you have not collected the flipchart sheets throughout the sessions, you can refer to the 'Session Summaries' in the 'Facilitator's Guide.')
- Explain to the young people that during this activity, they'll consider the changes made through their involvement in the group, the obstacles they face in adopting positive behaviors, and how they can help each other maintain these changes. 1
- them to reflect on their journey in the group to answer the following 2 ?
- ASK questions:
- a. What did I learn in this group (new knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors)?
- Possible probes: What do you remember from the poem that you composed in Session 1? As you reflect on the gender norms we talked about over the previous seven sessions, how are you actively challenging your own prejudices and biases?
- b. Has your outlook on these topics changed? If so, how?
- c. Have you noticed any changes in the way you interact with others? If so, how?

## FUTURE ORIENTATION

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Young people will envision a collective preferred future for their community, as well as the individual goals they are working toward. This is an opportunity for young people to reflect on their past as well.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Print out Support Sheet #8.3.1 and #8.3.2 for everyone.

Histories' activity, what is one event that would bring you pride or joy in the future? (Examples: Obama was elected, John Lewis voting rights act passes unanimously)

f. Are there barriers to achieving and maintaining the new changes?

- We are always changing. Make sure these changes are positive.
- We can surround ourselves with people who encourage us to do better. We can also be this positive influence for our friends.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Explain to the young people that during this activity, they will reflect critically on both the personal future that they would like for themselves and the future they hope to see for their community and society at large. 1
- Hand out Support Sheet #8.3.1. Ask young people to reflect on the following and fill out the sheet: 2
- a. Important moments/milestones from their past
- b. Important moments/milestones from their present reality
- c. Future milestones to strive for
- After the young people fill out the 'Individual Future Orientation,' ask some reflection questions: 3
- a. What do you want your future to look like?
- b. Who would you like to be surrounded by?
- c. What would you like to be doing?
- d. How would you be feeling about your life?
- e. How do people treat each other in this future?
- Hand out Support Sheet #8.3.2 to each young person. It looks similar to the sheet on personal futures, but this time, the young people should reflect on their community's journey. 4
- Explain to the young people that to achieve their goals for their communities, they will need to work together. There may be limits to collective action for change, but as we have learned throughout this curriculum, we have a community support network to draw on to enact change. 5
- Divide young people into groups no larger than ten people each. Give the groups 15 to 20 minutes to complete their task. Groups should consider: 6
- a. What actions can young people take to prevent violence and promote peace? If they have trouble coming up with actions, share the following examples:
- Action to empower and engage young people
- Broadcasting messages on gender equality and promoting peace in schools and support structures for young people (youth centers, local churches, libraries, recreation centers)
- Action to strengthen young people's resilience when facing messages from radical extremists and to foster the emergence of a real sense of identity and belonging
- b. When and where can you implement these actions?
- c. What opportunities and resources do you need to accomplish these actions?

## Closing Statements

- d. What are the possible obstacles, and what can you do to overcome them?
- e.  What support do you need and from whom?
- Have each group report back to the larger group. Keep these ideas written down somewhere and use this in Session 9.
4. /.notdef - Communication and cooperation are vital to their community - for example, to prevent gender-based violence, eradicate gun violence, and promote peace.
- By identifying personal and communal goals, we start to imagine a community where everyone can thrive (not just survive) and where we can begin to heal.
- Collective action - working together with each other - we have the opportunity to make real change in our communities.

## WHAT IS ACTIVISM?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Young people will discuss the purpose of activism and what some common forms of activism are.
- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Research at least two to three movements or activists in your area so you can talk about them with your group.
- Go to Stepping Up: The Community Organizer on your computer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y\_nAdIhJuY

## Procedure

<!-- image -->

## Introduce the activity by SAYING:

- a. At this point in Creating Peace, we have talked about so many important topics that impact our lives: our identities, gender, race, power, health, and violence.
- b. As important as it is to know about these topics, it's equally important to raise awareness or make positive change. Today, we are going to talk about what we can do in our own households and communities to start making changes to be healthier and less violent.
3. ASK 2 ?
- a. Can anyone tell me what activism is? (Formal definition: Activism is when people act with the explicit goal of seeking social change by advocating for issues of relevance and concern.)

<!-- image -->

3

## SAY

- a. That's right, activism is when people take action into their own hands and do something about a social cause they care about - for example, racial justice, human rights, or saving the environment. At its core, activism is about 'people power' trying to address and challenge structural inequalities around them.
- b. This can take many forms and usually depends on the community and goals of the activism - from community organizing to using art. Sometimes, activists want a law passed by Congress or for a new building development to stop being built. The ways you go about your activism can change depending on what you want to change.

Play the video: Stepping Up: The Community Organizer. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y\_nAdIhJuY)

## ASK

- a. Can someone tell me what Veronica's passion was and why she got into community organizing in the first place? What's her motivation?
- b. Do you have any other thoughts about the video and how it could relate to your lives and our group in Creating Peace?
- It's important to recognize the power of people, whether individual or collective. And activism is a great way to harness people's energy and power to start changing the structural inequalities around us.
-  Activism is an umbrella term that can include any expression of large acts of protest or small individual actions that vocalize opinions.
- Impact won't happen overnight - it's about activating passion in others toward a common goal.

Objective

Preparation

Young people will discuss the possibilities for change in their own communities as related to topics covered in Creating Peace. They will then choose one idea for activism in their own communities to plan and execute in Sessions 10 and 11.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Print Support Sheets #9.3.1 and #9.3.2 for all participants.

## Procedure CHOOSING AN ISSUE

<!-- image -->

1

- 2

## SAY

- a. Today, we are going to pick an activism issue to carry forward with us for the remainder of our sessions together. Picking this issue can be tricky - but we have a few questions to ask ourselves to make sure we arrive at an issue that we are passionate about and can make some change in our community.
- b. I'm going to hand out a paper that can help us think through what we want to concentrate on. Divide the young people into two groups and give each group a portion of the traditions/practices.

Hand out Support Sheet #9.3.1 and SAY

- a. Let's turn our attention to what we've talked about over the past nine weeks. What are some of the topics that we've discussed? And more importantly, what kinds of changes would you like to see in our community? Think back to the activity we did last session in our groups.
- b. For each of the ideas that you mention, we'll 'test' it against the checklist I just handed out.
- c. Let's come up with five issues to start.

<!-- image -->

10 Minutes

<!-- image -->

## • Probes:

1.  What are you all passionate about?
2. What changes would you like to see? What's your vision of the change? What does the alternative look like?
3. What are some challenges that young people face each day in your community? In school? Out of school?
4. Write the ideas down on a flipchart paper. Guide young people in thinking about the strategic considerations for each issue by going over the questions on the support sheet. 3
5. Narrow down the ideas that have been brainstormed by way of group evaluation and conversation. Finalize the choice of a single, winnable issue with a vote. This is the issue that young people will use to move forward with planning and executing an activist-oriented event. 4

## CREATING A STRATEGY

50 Minutes

<!-- image -->

- Hand out Support Sheet #9.3.2. Have a young person (or two) volunteer to read from the introductory paragraphs (starting with 'Making a big change can take time…'). 5
- ASK 6 ?
- a. Why is it important to tell our story?
- b. Who can give me an example of a goal from another area of your life that considers both quality and quantity? .
- c. Who can give me an example of a short-term and long-term goal from another area of your life?
- SAY 7
- a.  Developing more and more young leaders is always an important goal because it ensures that the work we start is continuous and that many people can make the work happen. Many activists start to feel like the whole world is depending on them and quickly become exhausted. It is important for us to all share that load to the best of our ability so we can step up and step back as we need to without losing our momentum, our passion, our individual and group power, or our sense of community.
- b. We also all have unique talents and skills to bring to the table, and we want to make sure that we tap into everyone's creativity and gifts to build a strong and resilient movement. Everyone's voice matters.
- c.  At the end of the day, we are doing this work because we care about ourselves and about each other. We can't forget that as we work toward our goals. So, let's talk more about what goals we may have about the issue we have chosen.

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

Remind young people to be specific. For example, if they say a goal is to 'bring awareness' - ask them who needs to be aware? How many? What do they need to be aware of? How will their awareness help us? If they say their goal is to get media coverage, ask: What type of coverage? How many radio and TV stations? Social media reach?

Try to guide them toward putting a specific number on things, and help them keep their goals within reason. It does not have to be perfect, just a reasonable, educated guess.

If their goals are qualitative, ask why those aspects are important. For example, something like building young people's self-confidence helps our movement and reflects the values we defined within our group throughout the previous sessions. Living out our values each day, whether anyone is watching or not, helps us live our best lives and is also a form of leadership by example.

It may help the process to define your larger goals first and then define or refine the short- and medium-term goals after considering other factors. Tactics should be determined last because they need to take everything else into consideration to be effective, be goal-oriented, and fit within the available resources.

You'll notice purple boxes in this activity with example answers for a hypothetical issue (reforming their school dress code). These answers should not be read to the young people; they are listed to provide you with some ideas to generate conversation.

- Pass out copies of Support Sheet #9.3.2 and have the young people follow along as you go through this exercise. 8
- Ask the group to define their long-term goals (three to five years or more) and write down the answers: 9
- a. What is the ultimate goal of your campaign? What is your big-picture goal if you could have what you really, really want?

## EXAMPLE ANSWERS FOR CHANGING THE SCHOOL DRESS CODE

- Replace the Pittsburgh Public Schools (PPS) school board dress code with a declaration of rights and responsibilities related to bodily autonomy.
- Eliminate all individual school policies that are more strict that the minimum standards of the PPS school board.
- Build a large community of civic-minded students who are ready to go out and change the world as confident young adults by the time they graduate through activism, peer support, community building, and mentoring.

- Ask the group to define their medium-term goals (two to four years) and write down the answers: 10
- a. What actions will eventually lead you to your ultimate goal? During these actions, how do you want to define a win?

## EXAMPLE ANSWERS FOR CHANGING THE SCHOOL DRESS CODE

- Get five principals (out of 54) to agree to drop dress codes that are more strict than the minimum policy provided by the school board. Increase this number the following year.
- Get five principals to agree to stop enforcing school dress codes altogether and informally adopt a rights and responsibilities document instead.
- Get one or two security guards at each school to agree to stop enforcing school dress codes.
- Identify and support two new student leaders in each grade at five schools.
- Add 250 supporters to our contact list.
- Add 250 students to our student contact list.
- Engage with ten more journalists and maintain contact.
- Ask the group to define their short-term goals (first year) and write down the answers: 11
- a. What are short-term or partial victories you can win as steps to your bigger goal? What small steps can you begin to take right now that will bring you closer to your long-term vision?

## EXAMPLE ANSWERS FOR CHANGING THE SCHOOL DRESS CODE

- Hold one or two informal/social events for other students. Learn more about how the issue impacts all of us by talking with each other and listening to our peers. Get to know each other and build trust and friendship. Grow our group of committed student activists to a total of 50.
- Grow our group of supporters through education, art, conversation, and public events. Hold an event that raises awareness on the issue and add 50 new supporters to our contact list.
- Engage with three journalists and maintain contact.
- Develop three to five new leaders.

## SAY 12

- a.  Now, we're going to transition into the landscape of actors who are involved in this issue. We've divided this into three categories: constituents (others impacted by the issue), allies (any people or groups that support you), and opponents (people who do not agree with you).

?

<!-- image -->

## 13

14

15

## ASK

- a. Which individuals or groups of people are affected by this issue? Who and how many people could benefit from this change? The people who directly benefit from your activism are your constituents.

## EXAMPLE ANSWERS FOR CHANGING THE SCHOOL DRESS CODE

## Students

- Any PPS student who is subject to the dress code
- Students at other schools who may want to challenge their dress code
- Future PPS students (your younger siblings, future children, nieces, or nephews; kids from your community)

## SAY

- a.  It's easy to feel like other people don't care about something that is a really big deal in your life. But you might be surprised to find that a lot of people really do care about things that affect you. When you ask the right people, sometimes they are really happy to help.
- b. That's not always the case, and it can be difficult to find out that someone who you thought was in your corner really doesn't get it. It can be important to prepare yourself for that, but it's also important to be okay with hearing 'no.'
- c.  If we let the fear of hearing 'no' keep us from asking for what we need or want, we could keep ourselves from making really important connections with people who believe in us and want to help us.

## ASK

- a. Which people or groups support you and lift up your work? Whose voices can you leverage to make noise around this issue? These are your allies.

## EXAMPLE ANSWERS FOR CHANGING THE SCHOOL DRESS CODE

- Parents: Not all parents will support the movement for making this change, but some will, and some can be persuaded to become allies over time.
- People and organizations who care about the issue: Individual activists, organizers, or community organizations might focus on this issue or a related issue and are often willing to lend their voice or other resources to further a cause when asked. Possible examples might include:
- Women's Law Project of Western Pennsylvania.
- Heather Arnett, former PPS school board member and founder of the Women and Girls Foundation.
- Pittsburgh LGBTQ, antiracist, and anti-violence organizations and leaders.

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

<!-- image -->

## 16

## SAY

- a. Opponents are individuals or groups who oppose what you are working to achieve and may actively stand in the way. Who are they for this issue?
- b. There are some other questions to consider when thinking about your opponents that might allow you to come up with a better strategy. Let's consider:
- What will your victory cost them?
- What will they do to oppose you?
- What resources do they have, and how much will they spend?
- How strong are they?
- How are they organized?

Note that opponents are different from targets because opponents cannot give you what you want and do not need to be a specific person (although individual people can be included). This distinction frequently requires a lot of clarity and guidance on the part of the facilitator, so try to be particularly aware of this and help participants stay on track.

## SAY 17

- a.  A target is someone who can give you what you want or someone who has power over that person. A target should always be an individual person (or specific people) with a name and address rather than a group.
- b. Voters are anyone living in a particular area that holds elections for a body of government (school board, local city council, county representative, etc.). This is important when choosing tactics, but remember that ' voters' cannot be a target because they are a group of people. A target needs to be an individual (or individuals) with a specific name and address.
- c. A target may be opposed to what you are working toward, but they are still different from an individual opponent because they must have the power to give you what you want.
4. Ask the group the following questions to identify the primary and secondary targets 18
- a. Primary targets:
- Who has the power to give you what you want?
- Who has the power to make this change in the policy/law?
- Who has the power to implement a new policy/law?
- Who has the power to enforce (or ignore) the existing policy/law?
- What power do you have over them?

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

## b. Secondary targets:

- Who has power over your primary target(s)?
- What power do you have over them?

## EXAMPLE ANSWERS FOR CHANGING THE SCHOOL DRESS CODE

- At an individual school, the principal may be the primary target.
- The secondary target could be the principal's direct supervisor - the superintendent. It's also true that the school board has power over the superintendent, but it is important to identify an individual or individuals on the school board rather than simply targeting the entity.
- Voters would be the people living within the school district, regardless if they have children going to the school.
- Once young people have set goals; defined key constituents, allies, and opponents; determined a target or targets; and taken stock of their resources, they can plan their action or event ( tactic ) in a strategic and empowering manner. 19

## SAY

- a.  A single action, event, or tactic rarely solves an issue by itself. Tactics are a series of complementary actions that fit into a broader strategy, like stepping stones toward our vision of the future.

You can also use the example of a sports competition - plays in a football or basketball strategy for a game, a season, or a career.

- b. These stepping stones become part of our collective story. Telling our story can be healing, and it brings more and more support to build a bigger and stronger movement for social change.
- c.  As we have seen from history, real change takes time, hard work, passion, and commitment. Each win matters. It prepares us for our next moment and gives us something to celebrate together along the way.

Provide some guidelines on tactics before crowdsourcing a few options for their initiative. that tactics should be:

- SAY 20
- a.  In context: Is the connection between the action and the issue/vision clear to our intended audience?
- b. Flexible and creative: Flexibility is important, as conditions can change quickly.
- c. Directed at a specific target: This should be a person (or people) with a name and an address.
- d. Leveraging a power dynamic: What power do we hold in this scenario, and how can we use it beneficially to create change?

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

Ask the young people what they would like to do for their action in the next couple of sessions. You can use the following example tactics to provide some ideas to build from. 21

You can draw on examples covered in Activity 9.2 or ask young people for examples (when age-appropriate and helpful); some things may require more explanation than others. To increase participation in the discussion, you can ask participants questions about why or how some of these things could be helpful to their cause.

If your group has challenges with designing an activism event, Annex D has examples of what a community meeting or 'art as activism' event could look like in Session 11. During this meeting, young people would have an opportunity to present on what they learned during Creating Peace, as well as foster a community dialogue about what young people want in their community.

- a. Media events, such as press conferences: Anytime you want to get your message to a broader audience, you can hold a press conference or provide a press advisory notifying the media that an action will be happening so they can send someone to cover it. A press release gives journalists the information they need to write about what you are doing and why.
- b. Actions for information and public demands: There might be additional information that will help you make your case. If this information is important to making the change you want, it might make sense to hold a public action that gets people's attention so that the power holders are under pressure to provide the information.
- c. Public hearings: School boards and city councils hold regular public hearings on issues that impact their constituents. There are typically opportunities to speak for an allotted amount of time. You can also usually request a hearing in front of these elected bodies to discuss a particular issue.
- d. Strikes: One person refusing to participate in something usually does not create broad change. But large groups of people getting together and refusing to comply with an unjust rule or law has created many important changes - from the US civil rights movement to the liberation of India from British colonialism. Strikes, sit-ins, and work stoppages are not just for grown-ups and workers. Students can use their collective power to claim their rights and have done an excellent job of using it over history as well (like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC; the Coalition of Immokalee Workers; and 350.org).

## EXAMPLE ANSWERS FOR CHANGING THE SCHOOL DRESS CODE

- Mass noncompliance with dress code: Get 75 percent or more of the school to refuse to comply with the dress code.

## NOTE

- Walk-out/student strike:
- Students walk out at 9 a.m. and leave until the next day.
- Students stage a 'sit-out' by arriving at classes and sitting in the hallway in silence until the period is over.
- Students take a vow of silence for a period of time.
- e. Voter registration and education: Sometimes, people try to exclude young people from civic engagement because they are too young to vote. But oftentimes, juniors and seniors reach voting age during school or soon after graduation.

## EXAMPLE ANSWERS FOR CHANGING THE SCHOOL DRESS CODE

- High school students do peer education about school board elections and voter registration.
- A voter registration drive is held for high school students and recent high school graduates.
- Even if a student can't vote, they can still:
- Support school board candidates who align with their issues and values
- Voice their criticism of school board candidates who do not align with their issues and values
- Influence adults in their lives who do vote
- Run for student government
- Vote for student government
- Petition the school board, school administration, or student body government about issues that elected and employed groups are responsible for taking care of
- f. Negotiations: Sometimes, we use tactics to convince someone in power to negotiate with us. That might mean having a meeting with decision-makers (like principals or school boards), or it might mean sitting down with a group of potential supporters (like the parentteacher association) to ask for their help.
- Have the group agree on a tactic to plan in Session 10 and talk about the different resources and assistance they might need to pull off this tactic. The following Facilitator's Note has guidance to assist with this conversation. 22

## Resources and Group Considerations FACILITATOR'S

The kind of event or action you choose to create will depend on what resources are available to you. When we think about resources and cost, money is one obvious factor that we need to consider. But there are many other types of resources, like supplies, meeting and event spaces, volunteers, power, influence, networks, and connections. Creativity is an important part of activism, and that includes being creative when we think about what is available to us and how we can put it to use.

## Closing Statements

## First, let's talk about some of those resources besides money. Here are some examples:

-  Art supplies from home, church, school, after-school activities, and community organizations.
- Food and donations for events from local bakeries.
-  A parent who works in a public office or who has a relationship with a local politician or community leader.
-  A parent, community leader, or family friend who has the power to speak to the issue in a positive way in support of the activist group.
- Membership in a youth theater, choir, faith community, or other organization that can provide a meeting or event space.

Now, let's talk about money. Very few people like to discuss money, but it's a huge factor in everyone's life. Maybe that's why it can be so uncomfortable. But finding money for things that matter to us is important sometimes, and most people feel good about giving money to people and causes that they care about. Sometimes, we might not have money available, but raising some of it might be easier than we think. Here are some examples of fundraisers:

- School bake sales, candy sales, and hoagie sales
- Offering baskets in church
- Ticket sales and snack sales at school plays
- 50/50 raffle
- Dance-a-thon

Another great thing about some of these is that they bring awareness to your issue in the process. Fundraising should reinforce your activism, and activist events can also provide an opportunity to raise money for the next event. Virtually any activist event can include 'passing the hat' taking an informal collection in a similar manner to passing the offering basket around at church.

## SAY

- a. Thank you for sharing these great ideas for activism in our community. Next session, we will revisit this conversation and continue planning for our initiative.
- Activism will be challenging at times, but we can approach it as small pieces of a larger puzzle. It usually takes a long time to enact change in our communities, so perseverance and endurance are important.
- Activism can take many different forms.

## SUPPORT SHEET #9.3.1 Identifying Your Cause

Choosing a cause for activism can be a complicated proces. We have adapted a checklist from the Midwest Academy (midwestacademy.com) to help you out. The following questions will help guide you to see if your cause is an actionable and relevant one to engage in activism.

1. Does this result in real improvement in people's lives?
2. Does it give people a sense of their personal power?
3. Is it widely felt? Deeply felt?
4. Does it create opportunities to build lasting alliances and relationships within your group and community?
5. Does it create accesibility for those with traditionally marginalized voices to develop as leaders?
6. Does it promote awarenes and respect for our rights as human beings?
7. 7 . Does it have a clear solution?
8. Does it have a clear time frame?
9. Does it challenge things like institutional racism, sexism, and other systems of oppresion we discused?
10. Does it link local concerns with national or global concerns?
1. Does it promote our visions of the future that we shared during this program?
12. Does it provide us with experience to do our next activist event?
13. Is it easy to understand, specittc, and winnable?

## SUPPORT SHEET #9.3.2

## Activism Strategy Worksheet

Making a big change can take time. It's important to have a series of goals along the way. Remember that along with our big win, there are many small wins on the journey toward our vision for the future. They matter for our strategy, but they are also an important part of maintaining our hope and motivation, realizing our own power, and telling our story.

It is really important to set goals that focus on both quality and quantity. We want our wins to be meaningful, and we also want them to be measurable. A good list of goals balances things we feel and things that give us a clear picture of our progres.

(Three to ttve years or more): What is the ultimate goal of our campaign? What is your big-picture goal if you could have what you really, really want?

(Two to four years): What actions will eventually lead us to our ultimate goal? During these actions, how do we want to dettne a win?

(First year): What are short-term or partial victories we can win as steps to our bigger goal? What small steps can you begin to take right now that will bring you closer to your long-term vision?

## LONG TERM

## MEDIUM TERM

## SHORT TERM

## CONSTITUENTS, ALIES, AND OPPONENTS

Which individuals or groups of people are attected by this isue? Who and how many people could beneGLYPH&lt;30&gt;t from this change? The people who directly beneGLYPH&lt;31&gt;t from your activism are our constituents.

Which people or groups support us and lift up our work? Whose voices can we leverage to make noise around this isue? These are our allies.

What would our victory cost these opponents? What will they do to oppose us? What resources do they have, and how much will they spend? How strong are they? How are they organized?

Which individuals or groups may oppose what we are working to achieve? Who may actively stand in the way? These are our opponents. (Note: An opponent is not the same as a target - a person who can give you what you want. While an opponent may stand in the way and inttuence decision-makers, they can't give you what you want.)

## TARGET

## TACTICS

A target is someone who can give you what you want and/or someone who has power over that person. A target should always be an individual rather than a group.

Primary targets: Who has the power to give us what we want? What power do we have over them?

Secondary targets: Who has power over our primary target(s)? What power do we have over them?

Tactics are a series of complementary actions that GLYPH&lt;31&gt;t into a broader strategy, like stepping stones toward our vision of the future. These stepping stones become a part of our collective story. Telling our story can be healing, and it brings more and more support to build a bigger and stronger movement for social change.

## Tactics should be:

- In context: Is the connection between the action and the issue/vision clear to our intended audience?
- Flexible and creative: Flexibility is important, as conditions can change quickly.
- Directed at a speciGLYPH&lt;31&gt;c target: This should be a person (or people) with a name and an address.
- Leveraging a power dynamic: What power do we hold in this scenario, and how can we use it beneGLYPH&lt;31&gt;cially to create change?

## Tactics can include:

- Media events: press conferences, public speaking, news interviews
- Actions for information and public demands
- Public hearings: school board and city council hearings, people's hearings

- Strikes: worker strikes, student strikes, student walk-outs, sit-ins, refusing to participate in unfair practices
- Voter registration and education: voter registration drives; question-andanswer events in schools and libraries; meet-and-greet/question-and-answer sessions with candidates, impacted groups, or outside experts
- Negotiations: meeting with a person or group of people who hold power
- Creative arts and educational events: sidewalk chalking, public speakers, flash mobs, street theater

## PURPOSE

- Have youth take their idea for activism (determined in Session 9) and plan for the event.

## DURATION

2 hours, 15 minutes (includes 15-minute break)

## MATERIALS

- Flipcharts
- Butcher paper
- Markers and other art supplies
- Copies of:
- Support Sheet #10.1.1: Tactic Planning Worksheet
- Support Sheet #10.2.1: Role-Play Character Descriptions

<!-- image -->

## PLANNING SESSION

(Materials were adapted from the Midwest Academy and the Center for Artistic Activism)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Objective

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

## Procedure

- Young people will take this time to plan their activism event as a group, including identifying the objectives and intended outcomes of the activity, reaching out to possible collaborators, and setting an agenda.
- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Have butcher paper or a whiteboard to take notes on during facilitation; you'll have young people follow along using Support Sheet #10.1.1. Distribute paper (bigger is better!) and some basic art supplies, such as crayons, markers, and pencils, or have these supplies set up in different areas of the room. (After setting goals, young people will spread out and do some creative visualization using the art supplies.)
- Playing some uplifting, energizing music and encouraging movement is recommended. Using music that you have chosen ahead of time and that does not have problematic lyrics (or any lyrics at all) will keep things moving smoothly during session.
- Welcome the young people to the session and tell them you all are going to jump right into planning the activism action that you agreed upon last session. 1

## SAY 2

- a. Now, we're going to do the portion of our strategy that many people enjoy the most - planning an activism action or event. This action or event is a tactic, as we discussed during the strategy session. We're to our issue, and we are now prepared to do that in a strategic manner.
- b. Let's start by setting some goals for this particular action or event . Since this is our first action together, a great place to begin is by looking at some of the short-term goals we discussed.
3. Have young people name some goals. Be sure to guide them toward being specific, and ask them to describe why those goals matter to them, the group, or the greater long-term goal. Be sure that goals are both qualitative and quantitative, with relative balance. 3

<!-- image -->

4

SAY

- a. Next, we're going to talk about our vision for the action or event. What will you do ? This is the part where you get to have some fun and be creative, so we're going to take a more creative approach in our planning.
2. Have young people spread out as much as possible. Ensure each person has paper and supplies. 5

6

SAY

- a. I'm going to play some music, and we're going to get out of our seats and move our bodies while we use our imaginations to visualize an action or event we'd like to see. We want it to be goal-oriented, but this exercise does not have to be 100 percent grounded in reality right now. We're going to be a bit idealistic. What would this action or event look like if you had no limitations whatsoever?
- b. Nothing is off-limits. If you want unicorns and Batman at the event, go ahead and draw that. Once we share our visions with each other, we can mix, blend, and refine them to fit our needs, resources, and limitations.
- c. For the next 15 minutes, spend some time thinking about our goals, and imagine your dream of what a successful and empowering action or event would look like, feel like, smell like, taste like, and sound like. You can draw your vision or write, or both.
- d. You can move around while you think or imagine, you can use your whole body to draw and write, or if it's your style, you can do some quiet reflection and small doodles. Any way that feels right to you is good.
- e. When time is up, we're going to come back together so we can share with each other and build from one another's visions.
6. Begin the activity, being sure to give some gentle notice as time starts to get short. When time is up, have young people come together with their drawings/writing. Hang them where everyone can see. It's helpful to have people sit as close as possible, and it's okay to use the floor, sit in a circle, or move chairs - whatever works in the space and is comfortable for everyone. 7
7. Call all of the group back to their seats and pass out Support Sheet #10.1.1: 8
- a. Open up the discussion to figure out what young people are most excited about and what common themes exist. Write them down on a large paper or whiteboard where everyone can see them.
- b. Following Support Sheet #10.1.1, begin shaping the action or event by focusing on how we can use those themes in a more realistic way. For example, you might see that a lot of the young people imagine a large group of supportive people in attendance. You can use that to help set goals around who specifically they want to be present and how many people they'd like to see there.

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

- c. Once you have all of this information, determine what tasks need to be completed between now and the event.

A lot of activism events can feel very emotionally charged - both positive and negative - and that's okay. Our feelings can teach us a lot about ourselves and about our connection to these issues. It is important for us as individuals and as a group to support each other in this journey, and part of that means checking in after the event.

One example might be to have young people  stand or sit in a circle together, do a grounding exercise, and then have each person share how they felt before, during, and after the event. It may also be helpful to encourage young people to check in with each other again in a few days, whether formally or informally.

It is common for people to feel empowered and elevated immediately following an event but to emotionally crash a bit a few days afterward. Self-care is important, but so is community care and wellness. We are committed to our goals, but we also have a commitment to ourselves and to each other - which is why we do the work in the first place.

- The group should agree on and delegate the tasks among the members of the group, with clear deadlines for each of the tasks. It is important that everyone plays a role in preparing for the event, whether it be logistics, communications, or day-of coordination. 9

If you think it would be helpful to meet with your group again before the event, please be sure to plan something. Session 11 doesn't need to be one week immediately after Session 10 if planning will take longer.

## SUPPORT SHEET #10.1.1 Tactic Planning Worksheet

What do you want to accomplish? What are you asking for? Who are you asking? How many new members or supporters will you bring into your movement? How do you want the experience to look and feel?

What will you DO? This is the part where you get to have some fun and be creative. How will you get your mesage out? How will you engage people? How can you use the unique talents of the members of your group to accomplish this?

Who should be present at your event and why? How many? How will you get them there? Will there be journalists present? Supporters? Which supporters? Constituents? Opponents? Will there be a decision-maker present?

GOALS

ACTION

REACH

How many people will participate? How many people will attend or be present? How many will be reached through social media or traditional media?

What resources do you or your supporters have on hand to contribute to this event?

Does the location have a relationship to the isue and/or our vision of the future? Does it provide visual, auditory, or other sensory interest for attendees and social or traditional news media? Does it have historical, cultural, social, or symbolic meaning or signiGLYPH&lt;30&gt;cance? Is it clear and simple for most people to make those connections to the location? Is there a cost, and if so, does it GLYPH&lt;30&gt;t within your budget?

## ATTENDANCE

## BUDGET AND RESOURCES

## LOCATION

How much time do you have to plan and execute the action or event? Do you need to scale up or scale down your event to ttt into your timeline? Try working backward from the event to today to get a realistic picture of how much time you will need. Make sure you consider everything on this support sheet, and leave some extra time for things you may not be able to predict ahead of time or isues that may arise.

After the event, how will you debrief together? How and when will you evaluate your event in order to continue your learning and growth? How does this become a part of your story, or our collective story?

## TIMELINE

## DEBRIEF

<!-- image -->

## RUN-THROUGH SIMULATION

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Objective - Young people will do a 'dress rehearsal' of a portion of their strategy.

Perhaps more importantly, it will help them test and improve their strategy by challenging them to think the way their adversaries are thinking. This allows them to anticipate what they are up against and plan ahead. Doing a role-play exercise puts new ideas into a reallife context so they are easier to understand and apply. It also teaches new and emerging activists of all ages to think more realistically, expect the unexpected, and enter into challenging situations with increased self-confidence.

<!-- image -->

## Preparation

<!-- image -->

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Decide if you would like your group to role-play their actual activism event or the example cause, the Pittsburgh Public Schools dress code , that has been included in the support sheets. You can make changes to the support sheet characters and scenarios if you would like them to do a different role-play.
- Print out copies of both character descriptions on Support Sheet #10.2.1.
- Write down the following questions on a flipchart or board
- Which individual or group of individuals is able to make a decision?
- Who has influence?
- Why do they have influence?
- What is their motivation?
- What do they have to gain or to lose?
- How can you leverage power to achieve your goal - whether that's changing something or stopping change?
- What power might they leverage against you or against a decisionmaker to stop you?

Divide the group into two teams. If the group is large, you can divide young people into four teams. Each team will have a chance to role-play the targets and opponents (decision-makers and influencers), as well as the activists and allies (change agents).

## FACILITATOR'S

## NOTE

It is in the best interest of time for the facilitator to assign roles within each group rather than allowing participants to choose their own. (If you are working with upper age ranges, you may decide to be more flexible in this area.) Young people should be encouraged to get into character, be creative, and have fun. There's a lot of flexibility and room for imagination within the broad role of 'student leader' or 'principal,' so although those are assigned, the details are up to the participants to bring to life as they wish.

It is common for activists of all ages to feel frustrated while role-playing themselves. Real-life feelings tend to come up, and people frequently find themselves feeling that the target and opponents should just 'do the right thing because it's the right thing to do' - even when they are fully aware that they are role-playing. Talking through this can help everyone prepare for experiencing those feelings in real life, and guidelines for creating safer, trauma-informed spaces should be applied (as in previous sessions).

Adaptations for time: If there is more time allotted, you can have the students experiment with variables (like how many adults versus minors are involved or changing the number of adults in power in each group) or role-play another future event. If there is less time, it is okay to go through the basic exercise once using the time allotted.

- Once young people have been divided into groups, have each group sit at a different table or area. Provide them with their respective support sheets describing their teams, and also write the teams on butcher paper/whiteboard where they are easy to see. One group will role-play the change agents, and one will role-play the decision-makers. Then, the groups will switch. Each group should be provided with some paper and writing materials for notes. It is also helpful to have cardstock and markers to make name tents with the appropriate role written on them to provide clarity and prevent confusion. 2
- Refer to the flipchart with the written questions from the preparation section and SAY : 3
- a.  For this exercise, we're going to have to think about some of the questions that came up when we were talking about power and roles.
- b.  It doesn't have to be perfect; we just want to get a good idea of what this looks and feels like. We can't predict everything in a real-life scenario, and we have to remember to be flexible and creative in the moment. But thinking and preparing ahead of time will always give us an advantage.
- Split the teams and have them discuss these questions, as well as the questions for your role-play team, and come up with a quick strategy for the meeting that you are about to have. 4
- After the allotted time is up, have the 'decision-maker and influencer' team take their seats at a table (the boardroom table) first - a power 5

| FACILITATOR'S NOTE | One of the student leaders on the 'change agent' team should present the issue. Aside from that, the meeting is unscripted. Facilitators should step back as muchaspossible, but ensure that the activity continues. If young people get stuck, ask them someappropriate prompt questions from the material to try to push them forward without over-directing. |

## CHANGE AGENTS

## Team Roles:

- 3-4 student leaders
- 1-2 supportive parent representatives
- 1-2 supportive adults from the school community (teacher, guidance counselor, coach)
- 1-2 city community leaders
- 1 individual principal

Congratulations! You have just successfully held your GLYPH&lt;31&gt;rst activist event to highlight the issue students have identiGLYPH&lt;31&gt;ed with the PiGLYPH&lt;30&gt;sburgh Public Schools dress code. Your team organized a creative event with hundreds of people in aGLYPH&lt;30&gt;endance and reached many more people through the local news media. You raised $1,200 from a bake sale and t-shirt sale, and you gathered a long list of supporters for your contact list. Other students are excited about the possibility of change and are ready to get involved.

Your smart, hard work and determination led to some people with decision-making power agreeing to sit down and have a conversation about the issue and how it can best be resolved. Some of the people who inGLYPH&lt;29&gt;uence those decision-makers will also be aGLYPH&lt;30&gt;ending. In other words, you will be meeting with some primary targets, secondary targets, and opponents.

Holding your event helped you connect with some important adults who have access to resources or power and who can give your group an advantage. Some of those folks have agreed to come with your team to the meeting to help and voice their support. These people are the allies we discussed when we talked about strategy.

- What are you asking for? Why does it maGLYPH&lt;30&gt;er?
- How does this issue impact you? Your peers?
- What constitutes a win? What can you compromise on? What cannot be compromised? Even if you don't achieve your primary goal, are there smaller goals that might constitute wins?
- What power do you hold over whom? What power do they have over you?

You will need to choose someone in your group to present your issue to the decisionmakers at the beginning of the meeting. This person needs to explain the issue in a clear, concise manner. Others in the group should be able to share why they support this and what they can or will do to support this, as well as answer questions when asked by the decision-makers.

## SUPPORT SHEET #10.2.1 Role-Play Character Descriptions

The decision-makers might say or do things that make you feel confused, frustrated, hurt, overwhelmed, or flat-out mad. It's okay for those feelings to come up. One reason this exercise can be helpful is that it prepares us for situations we may not have expected. That includes experiencing difficult and/or unexpected emotions during a moment in which we really want to focus or accomplish something. When we practice, we can learn how to hold space for those emotions without allowing them to derail our goals. In fact, those moments can help us, and they become important parts of our story.

If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, it is always okay to step out for a moment.

But similar to a sports strategy, we need to anticipate our obstacles and challenges. That means having back-up plans and options. So, if your first attempt doesn't work, be flexible and try switching to Plan B or Plan C. Maybe you start by appealing to someone's empathy only to find that they don't seem to have any. At that point, you may have to change your approach and be firmer, bring up some facts, or have a powerful adult step up in a beneficial way. Remember that there are many tools in your toolbox. If one of them isn't working, it doesn't mean there's something wrong with you or that the issue is personal. It just means that there may be a better tool for this particular moment and you have the power to use it.

## DECISION-MAKERS AND INFLUENCERS

## Team Roles:

- School board: director/head, member up for re-election, member whose term is ending but is not up for re-election
- Parent-teacher association (PTA) president who holds 'traditional social values'
- Superintendent
- 1-2 individual principals
- Gym/health teacher who feels dress codes prevent pregnancy and STI transmission

Congratulations! During this portion of our exercise, you get to tap into your inner villain. It might seem strange at GLYPH&lt;31&gt;rst to be GLYPH&lt;31&gt;ghting against something that you actually want in real life. But there's also something satisfying about acting out the role of your adversaries. Feel free to get into your role and take things as far as you can within the realm of the facts. So, for example, you can't give people power they don't have, whether that's GLYPH&lt;31&gt;ring someone they can't GLYPH&lt;31&gt;re or shooting lasers out of their eyes. Aside from that, you are under no real obligation to be 'fair' or 'reasonable.' Your primary goal is to shut down the change agents using any and all tools available to you.

- What motivates you to want to stop this change from happening? (Hint: If you can't think of any other reason, looking at money usually leads to something.)
- How can you stop the change while avoiding direct responsibility or accountability with people who want the change to happen? Can you pass responsibility oGLYPH&lt;30&gt;

to another person or group? (For example, maybe the superintendent says they empathize with the isue but cannot change it because it's the responsibility of the school board.)

- What inttuence do you have over the decision-maker or the change agents? (Can you GLYPH&lt;30&gt;re them? Punish them? Expel them? Promote them? Give them a raise? Promote their campaign for re-election?)
- What inttuence do others have over you? (Can they GLYPH&lt;30&gt;re you? Did they elect you? Can they give you something you want, like a job or a position in an elected body?)

There is no standard lesson plan for this session, as each group will differ depending on the form of activism they chose and planned in Sessions 9 and 10. The facilitator's role is limited in this session, as the activism efforts should be led by young people. The facilitator should be present mainly to support the young people. With the permission of the young people, the facilitator could also document the session with photos and videos.

## ANNEX B: SAMPLE ENERGIZERS

## SPAGHETTI

- Split young people into two to three groups with about five to ten people each. 1
- Have each group form a tight circle, with everyone sticking their hands into the center. With one hand, everyone should grab the hand of another person. Then, using the other hand, they should grab the hand of someone different. 2
- Tell the groups that the object of the game is to get untangled without letting go. By climbing, crawling, and wriggling around, they can create one large open circle or, sometimes, two unconnected ones. 3
- Have them begin. If any groups are totally stuck, say they can choose to undo one link and then reconnect once that person has turned around, seeing if that works. 4

(This energizer is fun and creates a nice physical bond among young people. It also subtly communicates ideas of working together to accomplish a task.)

## SHRINKING ICEBERG

- Split young people into two groups of five to eight people each. 1
- Put two blankets or several sheets of newspaper on the floor. Ask each group to stand on one blanket or newspapered area. 2
- Explain this is an iceberg that is melting, reducing in size by half every month. The object is to see which full team can stay on the iceberg longer. 3
- Ask the teams to get off the blanket and fold it in half (or remove half the paper). Each time, see how the teams find ways to support each other to allow everyone to stay on. 4
- The first team to keep more than half of their team on the iceberg wins. 5

## HOT PEPPER

- Gather the young people in a circle. Toss a ball (or another tossable object) gently to a participant. Young people should continue gently tossing the ball, saying 'Hot' when they catch it. 1
- As the ball is being tossed around, randomly call out, 'Pepper!' The person holding the ball when 'Pepper!' is called is removed from the circle. 2
- Have young people continue tossing the ball until only one person is left. 3

## THE RAINSTORM

- Ask the young people to stand in a circle with their eyes closed. 1
- Say that a rainstorm is approaching. 2
- Ask everyone to rub their palms against their pant legs. 3
- Then, ask them to lightly pat their thighs with their fingertips. 4
- Ask them to do it harder. Then, ask them to pat their hands against their thighs. 5
- Have them start slapping their hands faster and faster against their thighs. 6
- After a while, go back to lighter slapping, then patting, etc., to reverse the entire order until it is quiet again and the storm has passed. 7

(This is a physical but calming exercise that can be used as a closer.)

## I'M GOING TO THE STORE…

- Create a circle of chairs in the center of the room. Have enough chairs so that only one person does not have one. 1
- Have one person stand in the center of the circle. They should start the game by saying, 'I'm going to the store, and I'm taking my friend who…' and choosing a trait that some of the people seated have. For example, 'I'm going to the store, and I'm taking my friend who has a red shirt on.' All of the students with a red shirt on will get up and race to another chair, including the person in the center, leaving the remaining person without a chair to stand in the middle of the circle. 2
- The next person in the center repeats the phrase with a new trait. The rule is that young people MUST get up and move to another chair if the trait applies to them. They cannot move to the chair next to them. 3
- Repeat several times. 4

## STOMP PATTERN

- Teach the young people a three-count stomp pattern and do it together (like stompstomp-clap, stomp-stomp-clap). 1
- Then, teach the young people a four-count stomp (like stomp-stomp-stomp-clap, stomp-stomp-stomp-clap). 2
- Divide the young people in half. Have one group do the first pattern and the second group do the second pattern at the same time. 3
- If there is a bit more time, you can have individuals create their own patterns for the group to imitate. 4

## Procedure

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

<!-- image -->

Young people will talk about - and understand - their own and others' dreams through the arts using the Visual Voices approach.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Set up materials for the painting session and arrange the classroom in a way that facilitates the activity.

1

Open the session by explaining the activity:

- a. You will be able to express yourselves through art today. For the duration of the session, you'll create a drawing based on the topic 'What Are Your Hopes and Dreams for the Future?'
- b. You'll work independently or in pairs to create paintings on large pieces of paper or create writings/drawings on smaller paper.
3. Have young people begin. If time permits, you can ask a few individuals or pairs to share their art and the inspiration was behind it when time is up. 2
4. Ask young people to consider how they would like to present their artwork at the Session 12 celebration. 3

During the interactive painting and writing sessions, encourage and support participants in reflecting on their lives, experiences, dreams, and desires as individuals and then as a collective. Emphasize the teaching and strengthening of individual communication, team dynamic, and group exercises and discussions that reach beyond the actual painting and writing. If the young people are having trouble thinking of what to draw/write, have them think back to Session 8 ('Future Orientation' activity) and how they envision their future.

In terms of displaying young people's art, one suggestion is to separate paintings into vertical strips in equal segments; then, sew them back together side by side with other paintings, alternating segments from

Young people will invite the community members to the space and involve the adults in arriving at group agreements.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Write the activity outline for the session on a piece of flipchart paper and post it on the wall. Encourage young people to take the lead on all activities.

## Procedure for young people

- Explain that the program is going to involve discussing a lot of topics that are personal and potentially sensitive. It is extremely important that this be a safe, respectful, and comfortable space for members of the group to be able to talk freely about such personal and sensitive subjects. 1
- Explain that to make this program a safe, respectful, and comfortable space, the group needs a set of agreements that everyone agrees to follow. 2
- Explain what we mean by a brave space - not only should everyone feel safe to share their opinions and perspectives, they should also feel encouraged to do so as a benefit to well-balanced discussions. 3
- Ask the young people the following questions: 4
- a. What does safety mean for you? What makes a place safe or unsafe?
- b. What (or who) can help to make you feel safe?
- Ask the audience what sort of agreements are important to have safe and respectful discussions. Write them on the flipchart as you go. 5
- If the young people cannot think of any, use the following list: 6

## GROUP AGREEMENTS

-  Respect others.
-  Listen for understanding, not responding.
-  Struggle together, but stay in relationship with each other.
-  Call in; don't call out.
-  Use 'put-ups,' not put-downs.
-  Don't use jokes that are harmful or hurtful to others.
-  Respect the right of others to have different opinions.
-  Let others finish speaking.
-  Don't generalize about people. Talk about 'some' instead of 'all.'
-  Use 'I' statements' - own your opinions.
-  You have the right to pass if you feel uncomfortable.
-  Confidentiality and trust are important - what's said here stays here, but what's learned here leaves here.
-  Participate in ways that feel safe for you.
-  There is no 'quick fix' - this is a process.
- Read each agreement aloud, stopping to ask for any clarification questions that young people want answered to be able to uphold each agreement. 7
- Once the agreements are understood, ask the audience whether they have additional statements they would like to suggest to the group. 8

- Young people will lead the audience in describing what constitutes a safe environment for them
- Young people will guide a discussion about the four types of safety and dissect how these terms can apply to their interactions with each other.
- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Have the audience list the types of safety they can think of. What do they need to keep safe? What do they value being safe? 1
- Discuss the four types of safety from Sandra Bloom's Sanctuary Model: 2
- a. Physical safety: Being safe in your body and safe in the world
- b. Psychological safety: Being safe with yourself
- c. Social safety: Being safe with other people
- d. Moral safety: Being safe with a guiding value system
- Discuss each of these types of safety, and consider how they might be impacted (either positively or negatively) through engagement with law enforcement. 3
- a. How do people feel about their physical safety in those interactions? What about their moral safety?
- b. Is there a time you feel safe in one of these realms but not another?
- c. How can adults and young people work together to ensure safety across all four domains? What would need to change for this to happen?

## ANNEX D: GUIDELINES FOR ADAPTATION AND IMPLEMENTATION

This section provides suggestions on how best to tailor Creating Peace to the needs of the young people who will be served by your program. These recommendations should be seen as a guide rather than as a strict, prescriptive approach to implementation. Depending on the resources available, context of the group, and timeline, program implementers and/or facilitators can conduct some or all of the following steps to enhance the program. These guidelines will ensure that your program maximizes outcomes and impact by adapting the curriculum's implementation to be contextually specific and informed by research. Incorporating local norms and context into the sessions, as well as closely monitoring progress, will increase buy-in and enthusiasm among your facilitators and young people.

We recognize that virtual preparation and implementation may complicate your ability to implement these guidelines; however, we encourage you to still consider the selected monitoring and evaluation methods detailed here. Additionally, we have provided adapted versions of select sessions for virtual facilitation in Annex E.

## HOW TO GET STARTED

Conduct Formative Research

To better understand your population and inform your adaptation of Creating Peace, you should conduct formative research to gain insight into young people's needs and experiences related to psychosocial well-being, relationships, traumatic experiences, and exposure to violence, as well as how this relates to their gender identity and perceptions of gender relations. In preparation for this, ask yourself and your team the following questions:

- What do you aim to achieve by implementing Creating Peace in your setting?
- What do you hope to learn?
- What are the challenges and lived realities of the young people in your setting?
- How do experiences of racism interact with gender inequality and structural inequities, power differentials, and social exclusion in your setting?
- What are the existing policies and priorities in your community related to gender equity, racial justice, and ending gender-based violence?
- To what extent do violence prevention efforts for young people in your community integrate a gender-transformative lens (i.e., addressing how gender inequities and patriarchal structures contribute to violence exposure and use of violence in our communities)?

Onboarding Facilitators and Community Services

Usually, formative research is conducted using qualitative methods, such as focus groups, key informant interviews, and one-on-one interviews with potential young people. Given that all community organizations may not have the capacity to form new focus groups in addition to their current programming, another option could be to ask young people in existing programs for feedback on their community's needs and realities. Important questions to consider during the formative phase include:

-  Who are the role models for young people?
- To what extent are those role models violent or divisive?
- How will accessibility or transportation impact recruitment for the intervention, especially if community spaces are difficult to reach or scarce?
- How will facilitators create a climate of safety for young people in areas where community and structural violence are highly prevalent?
- How can we most effectively help young people think for themselves? They are often just repeating what they hear from adults or their peers. What are examples in our community for encouraging young people to build critical analysis skills?

When conducting formative research, select interviewers with experience conducting qualitative research or plan adequate time to train your interviewers well. Many of the questions you'll ask will be quite sensitive; young people will need to feel that they can trust the person they are speaking with, and the interviewer must not impose opinions on the group. More specifically, interviewers should take the time to listen to what young people say about their relationships, what it is like to be a young person, and the challenges they face. What do they want to learn to have a happy life? Make note of potential content that responds to their needs, as it is more likely to resonate and lead to changes in young people's attitudes or behavior. Equimundo often incorporates stories from young people facing common challenges, which are identified during the formative research phase, into the group education sessions themselves.

Finding facilitators who are the right fit is integral to a successful project. Depending on your context, you may be working with an existing group of individuals or need to recruit facilitators as part of your start-up. Facilitators need to be familiar with Creating Peace's philosophy, methodology, and curriculum before they begin interacting with young people in the program. A training of trainers is useful to make sure everyone receives the same level of instruction and background to Creating Peace. Toward the end of this training, you can include 'teach backs' of activities that will further help the facilitators be comfortable with the material.

You may consider creating a tool to measure facilitators' comfort and knowledge of topics before they move forward with implementation. Evaluating how facilitators are doing as they work through the curriculum is

Participant Recruitment essential to the fidelity of implementation and the principle of 'do no harm.' As we've detailed in this curriculum, it is important to pay special attention to trauma-informed approaches and potentially triggering components of this content. We advise that before the program begins, you should train nonhealth professionals on what they should do if they need to make a referral or deal with a particularly challenging situation.

In the start-up portion of your program, you should also form connections with community mental health service providers and other community groups. These connections will prove useful if you need to refer young people to professional services or you would like clinical supervision of a session. The Pittsburgh implementation of Creating Peace employed a formal asset mapping approach in each neighborhood to identify community leaders, adult allies to serve as facilitators, host sites in agencies serving young people, churches, libraries, and resources relevant to young people.

We recommend that gender-transformative group education activities be limited to small groups of roughly ten to 15 young people to ensure everyone can actively participate. The messages you use to explain what the intervention is about and where you recruit young people depend greatly on your intervention design - whether you are implementing via the health sector, in the community, within existing groups (e.g., sports or after-school clubs), or within an existing youth program.

In general, it is important to tap into young people's self-interest in change when approaching them to participate. While the groups will aim to challenge common misconceptions, program staff who are recruiting young people will want to emphasize the idea of the group sessions as promoting 'healthy relationships,' 'a peaceful life,' 'how to be a better person,' and 'how to be a part of community change.' Such language stresses the positive, expected outcomes of the groups and the importance of young people's proactive engagement. The message should be aspirational and speak to long-term goals for themselves and their relationships. Your formative research can also inform your recruitment methods and desired outcomes. Some sites may also consider tying this program to youth employment opportunities, including stipends for participating in this youth leadership development program.

## HOW TO ENSURE ADAPTIVE AND IMPACTFUL IMPLEMENTATION

Developing Your Monitoring and Evaluation Framework

Monitoring and evaluation are integral parts of implementing any intervention. Routine monitoring helps to answer output-level questions, such as how many sessions were conducted and how many young people attended each session. Monitoring also allows implementers to receive participant feedback in real time and adapt to the needs and preferences of the young people. Evaluations aim to assess the intervention's impact by answering outcome-level questions,

## Monitoring Your Program Outputs

such as the percentage of young people who have continued to participate in leadership activities. It is also important to assess the intervention's quality and fidelity, or how well it has been implemented.

You should ensure that your monitoring and evaluation match the intervention's goals and stage. Is this a first implementation or a pilot for which the key goal is to learn about the process and improve the intervention, or are you prepared to implement at scale and want to show impact? You also need to consider the resources you have to conduct monitoring and evaluation. Think not only about the information you could collect but also whether you will have the capacity to analyze and use the data (rather than collecting data just because you can).

The purpose of monitoring is to capture outputs and understand the process of implementation and fidelity to the intervention. Additionally, monitoring allows you to capture challenges, barriers, opportunities, and unexpected impacts as the intervention is being rolled out.

Program implementers can use a variety of methods to collect regular feedback on the intervention that will help them quickly identify and address problems if and when they arise. A number of key questions can help to assess this, such as:

-  How well are facilitators adhering to the content and messaging?
- How do the young people appreciate and perceive the intervention?
- How could the intervention be improved to help retain and motivate young people?
- How effective is the intervention in achieving its intended outcomes?

Depending on your program's size and the number of groups, consistency and standardization in implementation can be challenging. Active monitoring (e.g., spot checks, facilitator observations, and participant feedback loops) will highlight best practices or inconsistencies in session delivery per facilitator and allow for adjustments throughout the curriculum in real time.

At a minimum, you should aim to capture outputs that will help show what is being done (e.g., number of facilitators trained, young people recruited, and sessions carried out). Outputs allow you to understand the implementation process and fidelity to the intervention. This can be captured through data collection methods such as:

- Attendance sheets
- Facilitator diaries
- Photos/descriptions of campaign activities
- Regular facilitator meetings with minutes

## ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT TIPS FOR MONITORING

- Define what is and isn't essential to know to monitor the quality of the intervention.
- Identify any red flags that could indicate the need to follow up with a facilitator or change the intervention; incorporate these into routine monitoring.
- Develop quick, easy-to-use forms (such as checklists or multiple-choice questions) for facilitators to provide feedback on how the sessions are going.
- Schedule periodic observation visits in which an implementing partner observes a session in progress. Make sure not to disrupt the normal schedule of the group or distract from the session itself.
- During observation visits, ask young people to provide feedback on the content of the intervention, what they appreciate, and what could improve. This can help improve your ability to motivate and retain young people.

Each of these data collection methods has advantages and disadvantages. For example, facilitator diaries provide a fuller picture of how the session went without you being there, but they are time-intensive for the facilitator. You also need sufficient team capacity to read through all of the reflections and address issues as they arise. When designing your monitoring plan, be sure to choose methods that will enhance your implementation instead of detracting from its fidelity and rigor.

## Advisory Councils and Community Collaboratives

Creating Peace was co-created with community members, including young people. We strongly recommend that partners convene a youth advisory council to formally and regularly integrate young people's perspectives into the curriculum and formative research. Youth selected to participate in the youth advisory council should meet your program's eligibility criteria to ensure that their feedback best represents your population of focus, and they must be reimbursed for their time and effort.

In addition, the University of Pittsburgh and Equimundo teams have worked with a community collaborative throughout the implementation and rigorous evaluation of this program. The community collaborative has provided input on formative activities and offered many insights on how to refine the intervention to meet the needs of the young people. The selection of young people for these bodies should be strategic, thinking about who should be engaged long term in the project with an eye toward sustainability.

## Debriefing Sessions With Facilitators

We recommend scheduling periodic 'debrief' sessions with facilitators in which they can meet to reflect on the progress of their groups, discuss issues

Adapting the Curriculum to Meet Your Community's Needs or challenges they are facing, and develop joint solutions. In the 'Facilitator's Guide,' you'll see that we have suggested a 15- to 20-minute check-in before and after each session for facilitators to discuss how it went and any insights they would like to share with each other. These meetings can also be therapeutic, in that facilitators (who can suffer secondary trauma from listening to personal histories of violence or hardship) can gain a sense of healing and share any particular stressors they are facing. These sessions can also provide facilitators with a sense of agency and ownership. By eliciting their feedback and suggestions for improvement, you can send the message that facilitators' ideas are valued and important. During the initial training of facilitators, ask them how frequently they would prefer these sessions be conducted and the most effective way to structure them.

The debriefing sessions can also provide opportunities for program implementers to identify any risks, key lessons learned, and emerging trends during implementation, allowing time to adjust or reconfigure as needed. During these sessions, you can also identify with facilitators any young people who are demonstrating positive changes and practicing genderequitable behaviors, as well as engaging in community-level change. This can help to identify young people who could provide testimonies, participate in community events and campaigns, or be the subject of case studies to externally communicate the intervention's impact.

## Using the Collected Data

Once you have the monitoring information, what do you do with it? Use your monitoring data to improve your program and implementation. Consider sharing lessons learned with key partners and collaborators, including your community and youth advisory councils, funders, and institutional partners. Try to budget time and funds for dissemination activities, as these will further improve program quality and future community engagement.

As we've noted, listening to young people and community voices will inform how best to implement this curriculum in your community. For adapting the curriculum, we recommend paying attention to Creating Peace's theory of change (see 'Introduction') and its core components: the activities related to mapping histories of racial and gender injustice in the US, gendertransformative elements, positive bystander behaviors, and youth leadership skills (see 'Cross-Cutting Themes' in the 'Facilitator's Guide' section in the front of the curriculum). The length and frequency of sessions should not be shortened, as prevention scientists have demonstrated the need for continuous repetition and building on learning and skill-building over time.

Alongside paying attention to curriculum content, Creating Peace's original design was intended for delivery by facilitators (adult allies) in neighborhoods where young people were living, reflecting findings from prevention science that have underscored the importance of involving adults who live in the same

Evaluating Your Program Outcomes communities and to strengthen adult-youth connections. We believe this approach also promotes programming's longer-term sustainability.

The purpose of evaluation is to make judgments about a program, improve its effectiveness, and inform programming decisions. Your program evaluation should be driven by a theory of change - you may be using tools from the evaluation of Creating Peace in Pittsburgh, or you may have adapted your own. Ultimately, you want to measure outcomes to match your theory of change. For example, if you think the group setting strengthens trust among group members and, thus, allows them to ask for help when they need it, you might want to measure trust and help-seeking behavior. This section outlines some key steps and considerations while designing and conducting your program evaluation.

## Setting Parameters and Planning Ahead

Ideally, you should conduct evaluation design at the beginning of the project and not retroactively once the program has begun. Typically, the process of defining your key outcomes and impact begins in your proposals or program pitches. In any case, defining program outcomes is a critical step for a successful evaluation design.

Timing and planning are paramount in a strong evaluation. Most times, implementers assume the evaluation planning process doesn't take place until the end of the project. However, for many evaluation designs, the groundwork starts far earlier. For example, if you plan on evaluating change over time, you will need to plan accordingly with a baseline assessment before the program begins.

We encourage you to 'triangulate' your findings to minimize challenges with self-reporting or limited data collection methods. This may include surveying other family members in young men and women's lives (especially if they are unpartnered). Although this can add costs, it is an important aspect of accountability.

Certain types of data collection are more expensive than others. In general, focus groups may be less costly than quantitative research since they involve fewer people. It is also important to consider time and cost in your evaluation design. Although it is exciting to collect a lot of data, you need to be able to analyze and use it. Therefore, each data collection tool, method, and analysis should be directly connected to a research question or program outcome. As with monitoring, evaluation data collection can become time-consuming for everyone involved.

## Designing and Conducting Your Evaluation

It is important to be strategic and consider field constraints, such as:

- The time frame you have to administer the evaluation instruments

- The length of time young people can spend filling out or responding to your questions
- Ethical considerations, such as safety and confidentiality

Depending on the time and resources you have for an evaluation, the complexity of the design can vary. On the simpler end of the spectrum, you can evaluate program effectiveness using data collected from the young people in the program. For robust evaluation, program implementers should design and conduct the evaluation as they would for a study with a comparison group (such as a randomized controlled trial or a cohort study with a control group that is not receiving the intervention).

Evaluations of group education programs can include quantitative or qualitative methods or a mixed-methods approach combining elements from each. In the following table, we list some of the common data collection methods for each.

| QUANTITATIVE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | QUALITATIVE*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Since you are asking people for their time and effort in participating, it is your responsibility to understand whether the program has any kind of positive or negative impact. Even though evidence already exists for Creating Peace, you must ensure your current implementation, with its various specificities and any adaptations, is also working. You cannot assume that because it 'worked' in a different context, with another population, or even just when implemented by a different organization that it will work again in the same way. The evaluation results will help you learn or affirm what is working and not working in your intervention, and you can adjust it accordingly.

## Disseminating and Reporting Results

Evaluations are only as useful as what you do with the data. It is important to meet with project collaborators after the evaluation to share the results

Keeping an Eye Toward Sustainability and devise recommendations based on the findings. You should adapt the content and dissemination method for the audience. Through consultations with various community members and collaborators, the project team can reiterate the importance of the community being at the center of the intervention and increase buy-in for future engagement.

Consistent and long-term engagement from young people, facilitators, and community members is key to the program's success. Here are some tips for ensuring that people are feeling valued and respected from start to finish in your Creating Peace journey:

- Encourage young people to form a support network among group members prior to the intervention's end so they can continue meeting and supporting each other as friends.
- Identify young people who display the skills and motivation to be facilitators and equip them to facilitate new groups in their community.
- Involve community leaders and local authorities in monitoring and supporting the intervention, and link young people to existing public health initiatives or structures - in some settings, local authorities have invited young people to become peer mentors or support community outreach efforts on health equity or violence prevention.
- Encourage young people to create their own community action teams or clubs to mobilize their peers in the community, or to join and participate in existing community health committees or other relevant bodies in which they can continue to effect change in their community.

## Encourage Active and Continued Participation

In our team's experience, many young people value the rare opportunity to come together in socially sanctioned spaces with their peers to discuss the issues affecting them. When a safe and brave space is successfully created, young people are often motivated to return to the group week after week.

You can use different incentives to motivate them to show up and continue attending. Depending on your budget, material or financial incentives (such as snacks, transportation subsidies, T-shirts, airtime or phone credit, certificates, or other materials) can sometimes be cost-prohibitive or undermine efforts at sustainability. However, there are other, more affordable ways to incentivize, reward, or value participation (and facilitation). For example, you can provide community service or academic credit hours for attendance, or you can let young people know that community members and leaders value and validate their positive changes.

In some settings, Equimundo has found that community leaders' involvement and visible support have contributed to a recognizable 'brand,' which young people are proud of and strongly associate with. This has motivated young

people to live up to the ideals of the 'brand' and mobilized other young people to want to attend as well. In a virtual programming environment, this may not be as relevant, but we encourage facilitators to be creative and innovative in motivating and encouraging engaged participation.

## Motivate and Retain Your Facilitators

It is important to think of strategies to support, motivate, and retain facilitators. Facilitators may move away or drop out of the intervention over time. You should identify and explore factors that might contribute to dropout during facilitator selection and training, as well as reassess during implementation. You may also want to consider graduated or cascading facilitation structures, whereby select young people from the group graduate to become facilitators, replacing or alleviating some of the workload for existing facilitators. Additionally, high-performing facilitators could become 'facilitator leaders' who have additional responsibilities that support the program at large.

The quality of group education can only be as good as the quality of the training and ongoing support provided to the facilitators. Remember that the facilitators will be regularly interacting with young people, providing advice, and sometimes listening to difficult stories. This can be challenging, exhausting, and emotionally draining. Without adequate support, it will be harder to retain and motivate facilitators in the long term. We recommend the following strategies to motivate and retain facilitators:

- Provide in-service training. In addition to a training of trainers before program implementation, in-service training is important to ensure consistency and high-quality implementation.
- At the end of implementation, have a celebration appreciating the facilitators for their hard work.
- Make sure not to overburden facilitators with too many groups, constant travel, or lots of paperwork. Be considerate and calculate the amount of time a facilitator puts into preparing for, implementing, and monitoring the intervention. If certain tasks are too time-consuming, work with the facilitators to simplify the programmatic and administrative procedures.
- Ensure facilitators are provided with (and don't struggle to obtain) the materials needed to successfully implement the intervention. In some settings, this might include materials that might not be obvious or available, such as art supplies.

## ANNEX E: SELECT ACTIVITY ADAPTATIONS FOR VIRTUAL IMPLEMENTATION

In this annex, you will find selected activities adapted for virtual implementation. Although originally designed for in-person facilitation, this curriculum lends itself to remote learning. These strategies were used for Creating Peace implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic, when programming needed to be all virtual. In each of the following activities, we highlight alternative ways of facilitating the activity on an online platform in brown, bold, highlighted text.

## Procedure

equality within peer groups

- Build leadership skills to address racial and gender injustice in nonviolent ways
- Welcome everyone to the program. 1
- Share your name, pronouns, organization, and role as facilitator. Include some history about what motivates you to facilitate this program. 2
- Ask young people to share their name, age, pronouns, grade, and current school they attend. You can also ask them to share another fact about themselves to make this more enjoyable. 3
- Explain the difference between being a teacher and a facilitator. ( You can use some of the language found in the earlier 'Facilitator's Guide' section . 4
- Present the main goals of Creating Peace by walking them through the Google Slide deck. Summarize the following text in your own words: 5

## What is Creating Peace?

Creating Peace is based on a methodology that was developed in different countries around the world where young people have been exposed to negative experiences of violence, war, social exclusion, discrimination, and more. Such experiences may lead to negative effects on the way you feel about yourself and others, and they can affect your behavior and strain relationships with others.

Creating Peace aims to support young people like you in finding meaningful, positive, and nonviolent ways to deal with painful and negative experiences in order to build peace in your heart and mind, your schools, your families, and your communities.

## How does Creating Peace work?

During a series of 12 group sessions, you will undertake a journey with a group of your peers that is guided by facilitators. This journey will help to explore new directions in dealing with difficulties and challenges that all of you have likely encountered in life. You will develop new skills and ideas that can strengthen your capacities to deal with those difficulties at home and in your community. The Creating Peace group sessions are very different from normal class, where the teacher is bringing you new knowledge in a lecture format. In Creating Peace sessions, we all learn by listening, sharing, experiencing, reflecting, and practicing.

## Creating Peace is a journey.

You can compare it to a journey, a trip that we take together in which we need each other at every step we take. We all are carrying a 'backpack' full of experiences, memories, and mindsets we have collected in our lives until now. In the journey, we will unpack this backpack, add new items, and choose the items we want to leave behind and replace with others. Your destination in the journey is your future, your plans, your ambitions, and your well-being.

## The Creating Peace group is like a laboratory.

The group sessions are a place to analyze which strategies work and which do not work well in managing the challenges you currently face. Although the Creating Peace group cannot change the outside world (a world that has been unjust and unfair to you and others, one that may have hurt you and your families), this Creating Peace group can help you to change the way you travel in that world and experience the importance of collaboration, friendship, solidarity, and support.

Traveling together is a way to learn about yourself through others by exchanging, sharing, listening, and seeing. The Creating Peace group aims to improve your equipment in the backpack, providing the best possible skills and knowledge: skills and knowledge that may in the short and long term - help you to become meaningfully involved in building a world of peace, solidarity, and love.

## GROUP AGREEMENTS AND CREATING A SAFE AND BRAVE LEARNING SPACE

<!-- image -->

- Objective

Young people will collectively agree on a list of rules and expectations that will enable a safe, respectful, and comfortable space for members of the group to talk freely about personal and sensitive subjects.

- There are positive ways to deal with negative experiences. We can choose to respond to adversity in nonviolent ways.
- We are all learning from each other. I will learn from you as much as you will learn from me.
- /.notdef - Y ou don't know until you try. Be open to trying new skills and hearing different perspectives.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Write 'Group Agreements' at the top of a Google Doc while sharing your screen.

## Explain:

- The program is going to involve discussing a lot of topics that are personal and potentially sensitive. It is extremely important that this be a safe, respectful, and comfortable space for members of the group to talk freely about such personal and sensitive subjects.
- To make this program a safe, respectful, and comfortable space, the group needs a set of agreements that everyone agrees to follow.
- What we mean by a brave space is that not only should everyone feel safe to share their opinions and perspectives, but they should also feel encouraged to do so to support well-balanced discussions.
- Ask the young people: 2
- What does safety mean for you? What makes a place safe or unsafe?
- What (or who) can help to make you feel safe?
- Ask young people what sort of agreements are important to have safe and respectful discussions in a virtual environment. 3
- If the young people cannot think of any, use the list below: 4

## GROUP AGREEMENTS

-  Respect others.
-  Listen for understanding, not responding.
-  Struggle together, but stay in relationship with each other.
-  Call in; don't call out.
-  Use 'put-ups,' not put-downs.
-  Don't use jokes that are harmful or hurtful to others.
-  Respect the right of others to have different opinions.
-  Let others finish speaking.
-  Don't generalize about people. Talk about 'some' instead of 'all.'
-  Use 'I' statements' - own your opinions.
-  You have the right to pass if you feel uncomfortable.
-  Confidentiality and trust are important - what's said here stays here, but what's learned here leaves here.
-  Participate in ways that feel safe for you.
-  There is no 'quick fix' - this is a process.

## EXPRESSING MY EMOTIONS

<!-- image -->

- Objective
- Preparation
- Young people will discuss how sometimes emotions (and expressing emotions) can be a gendered concept when, in fact, everyone shares these emotions.
- Young people will be able to better articulate their emotions beyond their current comfort level and in a way that is not harmful to themselves or others.
- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Create a poll for ranking these emotions using https://www.mentimeter.com/:
- Fear, Affection, Sadness, Happiness, and Anger

<!-- image -->

- Remind young people about how we talked about the connections between showing or not showing emotions and the messages we receive 1
- Read each agreement aloud, stopping to ask for any clarifying questions that young people want answered to be able to uphold each agreement. 5
- Once the agreements are understood, ask young people whether they have additional statements they would like to suggest to the group. 6
- Ask young people to write their names into the document at the bottom; alternatively, you can write it in for them if they are joining by phone. 7
-  We are here to learn, so there are no stupid questions. It is important that we are respectful to one another even when we disagree or think someone's question may be silly.
-  We asked everyone to sign the agreements because it is up to everyone in the group to maintain them. If you see your peers not upholding an agreement, then please remind them so we can keep on track.

?

about gender. To refresh the group, ask how emotion is connected to the 'Gender Boxes.'

2 Share your screen and go to https://www.mentimeter.com/, where you have set up the poll. In the chat, share www.menti.com and the code for them to participate in the poll.

<!-- image -->

- 3

## Explain:

- a. We will be thinking about and discussing how easy or difficult it is for people to express various emotions. You should rank these emotions from the easiest to express to what is most difficult.
- b. The emotions ranked first and second are the ones we have often learned to express in an exaggerated way (or learned to express very well).
- c. Numbers four and five are those we haven't learned to express as well, or that we may have learned to repress or keep hidden.
- d. Number three may represent an emotion we do not exaggerate or repress but probably deal with more naturally.
5. Conduct the poll and display the results. 4
6. With the entire group, reflect on the similarities and differences found among the young people. 5
7. Explain that there are many different types of emotions beyond the ones listed. Provide examples of the range of emotions available to people (referring back to the 'Museum of Feelings' support sheet in Session 1). Encourage young people to name how they're feeling as specifically as possible. 6

## NAMING YOUR OWN EMOTIONS

10 Minutes

<!-- image -->

- Explain that while the previously mentioned five emotions are some of the most important and recognizable, they do not account for every emotion someone might experience. 1
- Share a Google Doc of Support Sheet #4.2.1 with all participants and ask them to review it. 2
- Direct the young people to use the list to identify two emotions they've experienced at the same time and give them a funny combination of names. Give them about four minutes; then, ask them to create another pair. 3
- a. If they have trouble, give this example: 'anxstatic' (ecstatic + anxious) - happy about some sort of outcome while also itching for the next step.
- Instruct them to think of a story for each pair, as well as an emoji that might reflect the pair. Ask for everyone who feels comfortable to share their pairs and stories with the group. 4

## In this activity, be sure to ask all questions.

- Why do people exaggerate or hide certain emotions?
- How do they learn to do this?
- What are the consequences of exaggerating or hiding emotions?
- What are the differences between how men and women are 'supposed to' express emotions?
- Why are emotions important? (Examples: Fear helps us handle dangerous situations; anger helps us to defend ourselves. Ask the young people for examples.)
- What types of emotions do you feel 'safe' showing when you are hanging out with friends or in your neighborhood? Why do these emotions feel safer to show than others?
- How do you think expressing your feelings more openly can affect your wellbeing?
- Your relationships with other people (romantic partners, family, friends, etc.)?
- What can you do to express your emotions more openly?
- You shouldn't feel ashamed to express your emotions even if it may be difficult.
- Expressing them, without causing harm to others, helps make you stronger and relate better to the world around you.
- It is common for people to hide fear, sadness, or even kindness - and to express anger through violence. We can change this.
- While this activity explains emotions in a straightforward manner, in reality, emotions are very complex. As we saw in the second part of the activity, one can experience multiple emotions at the same time. There is nothing wrong with having complex emotions, and it's important for us to try and remove the stigma of being 'too emotional.'
- Although you are not responsible for feeling certain emotions, you are responsible for what you do with what you feel. It is critical to distinguish between 'feeling' and 'acting' to find forms of expression that do not cause damage to yourselves or to others.

- Doing sports, eg., playing football and expressing the tension and frustration in hitting the ball
- Watching football (screaming is expression)
- Playing games
- Playing music, singing
- Praying, meditation, etc.
- Trying to forget and avoid the emotions
- Drinking alcohol, taking drugs to forget

## Procedure

1

6

Begin the activity by asking:

- a. Do you sometimes feel powerlessness, shame, or guilt?
- b. What makes you feel like that?
- c. How do you deal with those feelings?
4. As they are talking, write down some of their responses in the Zoom Whiteboard. 2
5. Share the Google Form with the group and give them five to ten minutes to fill out the form. Explain that this will be completely anonymous. In each section, they should respond to the following questions: 3
- a. What do you do when you feel powerless?
- b. What do you do when you feel anger, hate, or aggression?
- c. What do you do when you feel injured, shame, or guilt?
9. Split the group into two Zoom breakout rooms discussing responses to the following questions, each moderated by a facilitator: 4
- a. What do you do when you feel powerless?
- b. What do you do when you feel anger, hate, or aggression?
- c. What do you do when you feel injured, shame, or guilt?
13. Have young people write down the actions. When they have finished, have them come back to the large group. Lead them into a group discussion of the following questions: 5
- a. How are you doing?
- b. What were your thoughts and feelings while doing this exercise?
- c. Was it easy or difficult to find examples?
- d. What examples from your discussions would you like to share?

## SAY

- a. Nobody can avoid having problems during their lives. When facing difficulties, we respond with emotions: feeling angry, sad, frustrated, scared, and so on. Emotions are expressions of what we feel. Negative experiences may trigger negative emotions.
- b. Negative emotions are important and not 'wrong': Negative emotions should not be confused with 'wrong' emotions. Feeling anger,  frustration, guilt, and so on is not wrong. It may be appropriate and normal to feel angry when someone hurts you. What is important is the way you deal with the experience and emotion.
- c. Anger or aggression is an important emotion if it is used in constructive ways. Wanting to win the game, pass your exams, and climb a mountain are examples of when we need our capacity to mobilize aggression. However, aggression can also be used in destructive ways when directed toward destroying others or yourself.
- d. Explain that when you become angry, you have several ways to express that anger through actions and behaviors. In general, there

are four types of behaviors in responding to 'negative emotions' (emotions that don't feel good but are relevant).

## Share your screen and refer to the Google Slides already prepared. Ask them to think of examples for each type: 7

- Acting out: Seeking revenge and fighting others, e.g.,
- Fighting with the person hurting you
- Fighting with other persons that remind you of him/her/situation
- Seeking excitement (kicks) in different risk behaviors (gang groups, driving fast, criminal activities, harassing others, etc.)
- Communicating and sharing with other, e.g.,
- Talking to a good friend/person of trust about what happened
- Asking for support from peers, mentors, counselors, parents, etc.
- Talking at a quiet moment to the person that hurt you
- •Expressing emotions physically and relaxing, e.g.,
- Doing sports, eg., playing football and expressing the tension and frustration in hitting the ball
- Watching football (screaming is expression)
- Playing games
- Playing music, singing
- Praying, meditation, etc.
- Trying to forget and avoid the emotions
- Drinking alcohol, taking drugs to forget
- Isolating and punishing yourself in thoughts: 'all people are against me, all people are bad, life has no meaning,' feeling depressed, suicidal ideation
- Explain that some emotions may be easy to recognize and express, while others may be very hard to recognize and express to others. While young people have the same feelings and emotions, they may express them in different ways because they are taught to do so. (Refer back to the 'gender boxes' as much as possible.) 8

## ASK 9 ?

- a. What differences do you see between young men and young women in dealing with negative emotions?
2. Share your screen, open the Zoom Whiteboard, and divide it into two columns. On one side, write 'Positive,' and on the other side, write 'Negative.' 10
3. Review the responses to the Google Form, reading them out loud. Have the young people determine if they are positive or negative ways of dealing with the problem/emotion, listing them in their respective columns. Use the Zoom Whiteboard table along with the four main groups in the Google Slides to analyze the responses. 11

## Analyze the examples in the boxes on the type of behavior: 12

- a. Take the papers out of the three boxes, and read them out loud. Have the young people determine if they are positive or negative ways of dealing with the problem/emotion. Use the table on the prepared 'Positive/Negative' flipchart to analyze whether the responses are positive or negative.
- b. After you have read all of the pieces of paper, brainstorm by asking: What are some more positive coping mechanisms that we can use when we feel powerless or hurt? Examples can include:
- Physical exercise, sports
- Creating music
- Reading books, watching movies, playing games
- Praying, meditation, hiking, yoga, watching sports/football
- Talking with friends, mentors, peers, parents, or siblings
- Talking to a counselor or therapist

Make sure that the young people provide examples that make sense for them.

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

## Closing Statements

- Emotions are normal reactions to experiences.
- Negative emotions don't feel good but are important to recognize and acknowledge. Negative experiences affect our psychosocial well-being, feelings about ourselves, and relationships with others. It is normal to respond to such experiences with healthy coping - behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that help us to adapt and integrate the experience into our lives.
- Knowing yourself well, knowing how problems and emotions shape your behaviors, helps to respond in positive and constructive ways to negative experiences.

## HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Young people will identify healthy and unhealthy relationship situations, identify the key aspects of sustaining a healthy relationship, and define 'dealbreaker' moments where the relationship should end.

- Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- -Before the activity, create a Google Form/poll that includes each of the following statements, as well as the voting options 'Healthy,' 'Unhealthy,' and 'Depends.'
- The most important thing in the relationship is sex.
- You spend some time by yourself without your partner.
- You have fun being with your partner.
- Your friend is constantly making fun of you in front of others.
- Your friend only reaches out to you to ask for money or a favor. /.notdef
- You make your partner feel guilty for not wanting to have a baby with you.
- You usually make every decision for the couple.
- You stay in the relationship because it is better than being alone.
- You are in control of yourself and able to make your own decisions.
- You talk about problems when they arise in the relationship.
- You argue or fight almost every day.
- Your partner forces you to have sex when you don't want to.
- Alcohol and drugs play a major role in your friendship.
- Your friend is always available for you to vent your problems to.
- You ask your partner for their social media passwords.
- You give your partner the silent treatment after they look at other women or men.
- You have a friend spy on your partner.
- You pressure your partner to not use any form of birth control when you are having sex.
- You ask your friend to break rules made by their parents.
- You keep your word.
- Your sibling tells you to sneak out of the house with them.
- Your friend wants you to do well in school.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Explain that these are two types of relationships that will be explored today. 1
- Click 'Share Screen' in Zoom. Then, select the 'Whiteboard' option and divide it into two columns: healthy and unhealthy. Ask the group to define healthy and unhealthy romantic relationships by brainstorming words in the two categories that help describe them. Your Zoom Whiteboard may look like this: 2
- Download the whiteboard after they finish, and be prepared to revisit it later in the activity. 3
- Explain that young people are going to look further into what is a healthy or unhealthy relationship. 4
- Share the Google Form link via the chat and give them five minutes to fill it out. 5
- After the form is filled out, share your screen and review the results. Ask the group what they think about the placements. Review each situation one by one, allowing time for discussion. If they don't agree, remind them of the qualities of a healthy relationship (communication, respect, equality, responsibility, and honesty). Ask them if the situation shows these qualities, and move the situation to the appropriate column. 6
- Ask young people to come up with some other scenarios that might be considered unhealthy or healthy. These scenarios can be for romantic or platonic relationships. Ask them to think about the power dynamics in the relationships. 7
- Is being in a relationship a barrier or an opportunity? Why or why not?
- What, to you, are the most important things in a relationship? Is this different for everyone?
- What are some challenges or barriers to building the types of relationship we want? To building healthy, equitable relationships?

| HEALTHY       | UNHEALTHY                    |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| Honest        | Lying                        |
| Communication | Poor communication           |
| Equality      | Domination                   |
| Respect       | Being dismissive, belittling |
| Trust         | Mistrust                     |

- Young people will identify ways that the cycle of violence is perpetuated and can be broken.
- Young people will recognize that many of us have been exposed to and perpetrated different forms of violence and abuse and that we can make a change by choosing to be nonviolent.
- What are some of the consequences of being in an unhealthy relationship for you? For your relationships with others?
- How can we address situations when our and our partners' priorities are different?
- What role does trust play? How do we build that?
- What happens when we feel like we can't trust our partner?
- What are ways to build better communication or trust? What is our role in doing that?
- Do we have the same standards for romantic relationships as we do for friendships? Why or why not?
- Do we have the same standards for friendships that we do for family relationships? Why or why not?

## Preparation

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

<!-- image -->

Procedure

- Review activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
- Facilitators should meet beforehand and assess whether they believe they have established enough of a safe and brave space to have this conversation. If there is any apprehension, it may be best to skip this activity for the virtual setting. Facilitators should also assess their own comfort with this activity. If facilitators feel it could be triggering for them, it should be skipped.
- Have either a specialist in trauma-informed care or a young people service provider with a strong background in work with young people who have experienced violence join this session at the beginning of the Zoom to introduce themselves and share their contact information. Have them exit before the activity actually starts.
- Prepare Google Slides in advance with the definitions of violence.
- Create a Google Form with the following sections:
- An example of someone hurting another person
- How someone might feel when they are hurt
- How I might feel if I hurt someone
- How I might feel if I am hurt

This activity asks young people to think about personal experiences of violence, including witnessing violence and violence they may have perpetrated. Remind young people that they do not need to disclose anything personal and that if they do (especially if they are minors), facilitators may be required to involve other adult authorities to keep the young person safe. Youth should be reminded that the discussion is anonymous; they should not put their name on the paper/index cards.

Facilitation for this activity should always be done together with someone who has been trained in supporting survivors so that young people have an identified person to talk to if they would like. All young people should be given - and reminded how to use - resources relevant to interpersonal violence at the beginning and end of the session. It is important to provide the resources at the beginning in case a young person chooses to leave during the session.

Explain that the purpose of this activity is to talk about an important aspect of unhealthy relationships - violence. To do this, we need to remember that this is a safe space where we respect one another and do not share what is said in this group with others. 1

- Share your screen and open the Zoom Whiteboard. Ask young people what comes to mind when they think of the word 'violence.' Write their ideas on the whiteboard. If they say things like 'physical violence' or 'sexual violence,' ask them for specific examples. 2
- Once you get a long list, explain the following in your own words: At its most basic level, violence is a way to control or have power over another person. People often only think about violence as physical aggression, but there are other forms of violence as well. 3
- Screen-share the Google Slides with the definitions of the four types of violence that exist. Link the four different types of violence to the examples of violence that young people gave during the initial brainstorm. 4
- a. Physical violence: Using physical force, such as hitting, slapping, kicking, burning, or pushing.
- b. Emotional or psychological violence: Often the most difficult form of violence to identify. It may include humiliating, threatening, insulting, pressuring, and expressions of jealousy or possessiveness, such as controlling decisions and activities. It can also include restricting someone's movements. This form of violence can be verbal or nonverbal.
- c. Sexual violence: Pressuring or forcing someone to perform sexual acts (from kissing to unwanted touching to sex) against their will or making sexual comments that make someone feel humiliated or uncomfortable. It does not matter if the person has previously consented to sexual behavior - consent must be given at the time.
- d. Economic violence: When someone exercises control over another person's money and other economic resources. This type of violence is a way of exerting power and can be used to control someone's movements (for example, keeping them from going to school or interrupting their job).
- Create a new Zoom Whiteboard with columns that have the following titles: 5
- An example of someone hurting another person
- How someone might feel when they are hurt
- How I might feel if I hurt someone
- How I might feel if I am hurt
- Ask each participant to think for a while about things they may have seen or heard and fill out the Google Form, sharing the form through a link in the chat. Inform them that all responses are completely anonymous. Ask them to write at least one reply for each clothesline (or category). Allow about ten minutes for this task. Explain that they should not write much, just a few words or a phrase. 6
- Type responses into the whiteboard columns. 7

## Discussion

## FACILITATOR'S NOTE

## Closing Statements

- What are the most common ways we hurt one another?
- How do we feel when someone uses violence against us?
- How do we feel when we use violence against other people?
- What does it feel like when we've been hurt by someone we're in a sexual or romantic relationship with? How is this different than if it's someone we're just friends or have a casual relationship with?
- How does the media (music, radio, movies, pornography, etc.) portray some of the violence we've talked about?
- How do racism and other kinds of discrimination show up in violence that you have seen people use against others?
- Some researchers say that violence is cyclical - that is, if we experience violence, we are more likely to use violence against others. What do you think about this? Where might we see cycles of violence occurring - in our community? In our neighborhood?
- How do we assess whether a relationship is healthy and walk away from one that we don't find healthy? Why would someone stay in an unhealthy relationship?
- What role do you play in preventing this cycle of violence?
- What have you learned in this activity to help overcome violence?

If anyone in the group shows a need for special attention based on something said during the discussion, ensure that you as the facilitator bring the young person to meet with one of the site leads (at the agency where the program is being held). Ensure the young person knows where to get help, consider referring them to appropriate services, and discuss the issue with other senior staff at your organization (see the 'Facilitator's Guide'). Facilitators should adhere to mandatory reporting requirements as specified by their agency or organization.

- There are many ways that people can be hurtful toward others. This can include physical as well as verbal and emotional ways of hurting each other. Hurting others in these ways is a form of violence.
- Violence is often passed from person to person. Someone who has been hurt is more likely to hurt others later because of the pain they feel. This does not mean that violence will definitely take place, but just that it might. Recognizing the hurt and finding support for pain are some of the ways to stop this from happening.
- We have the opportunity here to break the cycle of violence that we experience and to prevent that cycle from passing on to others.
