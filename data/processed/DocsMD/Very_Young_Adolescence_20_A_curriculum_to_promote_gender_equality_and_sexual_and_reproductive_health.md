Introduction

## WORKING WITH VERY YOUNG ADOLESCENTS

T he period of adolescence is now widely recognized as an important time of transition into young adulthood. Hormones, social norms, and changing expectations of how young people should act are changing during this time; they begin relying more on peer groups to integrate more fully into society as they slowly enter into full adulthood. This is a time of increasing freedom (and responsibility) for boys, as well as restrictions for girls. It is also a time of experimentation. In the past decade, there has been a growing consensus that very young adolescents are at a critical age range in which most young people begin to achieve puberty, turn increasingly to peers as reference points, and experiment with social risk-taking behavior. Gender norms play a critical role in all of this.

A deeper understanding on how gender norms are shaped and manifest in early adolescence is needed, as are effective approaches to transform norms and improve sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Large-scale research focused on understanding this finds, for example, that adolescent boys are more likely than girls to endorse norms that perpetuate gender inequalities, or conversely that girls report more equitable gender attitudes. 1  In settings around the world, societal norms about being a man include being tough, emotionally stoic, and aggressive; taking unwise risks; conforming to hypermasculine sexual stereotypes; disinvesting in education; and not caring for one's health. These norms emphasize competition, domination, and aggression, and they devalue connectedness, caring, and emotional awareness. Such a conceptualization of 'how to be a man' has been shown to have serious implications for physical and mental health, as well as to predict limited emotional involvement with significant others and with children later in life. 2  While adolescence is commonly thought of as the time when pressures to conform to these male norms begin, research shows that societal pressures based on gender influence boys at much earlier ages and that by age five, male peer groups create penalties for deviating from them. 3  These compelling discoveries suggest that there is a need to begin much sooner to help boys become aware of, question, resist, and redefine ideas about masculinity.

Similarly, girls are too often socialized into a set of norms that encourages passivity, promotes sexual objectification, creates a sense of body image that leads to insecurity and poor mental and physical health, limits their movement in social spaces, hinders their participation in leadership, and often leads them to early relationships that put them at risk for sexual violence and coercion. In much of the world and in many households, girls are also socialized to carry out a disproportionate share of the domestic and care work, often to the detriment of preparing them to be actively engaged in issues outside of their homes.

All this being said, very young adolescence is also a period of opportunity to support youth to live up to their full potential. Young people need emotionally supportive family and peer networks, as well as space to define what manhood and womanhood mean to them. Innovative programming is needed to support very young adolescents during this critical period of transition to live healthier, happier lives.

## VERY YOUNG ADOLESCENTS IN MALAWI

Malawi has achieved some notable successes in health and development in recent years, with considerable improvement in the health of infants and children under five. Total fertility has declined alongside widespread adoption of modern contraceptive methods. Programs to contain HIV transmission and extend treatment have been rolled out on a large scale. With a large population in the adolescent age range, there are challenges in providing education and health services comprehensively, resulting in very large class sizes and limited access to learning materials. Teenage pregnancy is common, with 4.5 percent of 15-year-olds and 12.2 percent of 16-year-olds having begun childbearing, according to the 2015-16 Demographic and Health Survey.

While still predominantly a rural society, urbanization is taking place in Malawi. This presents opportunities - such as access to employment and education - as well as challenges, from disruption of social and family networks to a poor physical environment in informal urban settlements. Blantyre has the highest HIV prevalence in the country, at 18.2 percent (2015-16 estimate from the national Malawi Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment survey). Nationally, the femalepredominant gender disparity in HIV prevalence starts to become evident in the 15-19 age group.

The Global Early Adolescent Study of parents and boys and girls aged 10 to 14 attending two large Blantyre primary schools picked up on certain themes that influence young people's lives. These have provided some of the building blocks for this manual:

Environment : Situated in busy informal settlements, school compounds are not secure, and there are challenges with theft and antisocial behavior. Pornography is widely accessible in local video huts, and there are few restrictions on access even by very young adolescents if they can pay the entry fee. Most young people are engaged in some form of economic activity to assist the family. Sometimes young people arrange 'parties' in their locality to raise funds, often without parental supervision, and these can become a focus for risk-taking sexual behavior.

Preoccupations : Like young people everywhere, there is awareness of bodily changes and emerging sexual feelings among very young adolescents in Malawi. Romantic relationships are sometimes encouraged by a need for validation among friends or associated with gift-giving, although in this particular set of interviews, most relationships described were with similar-aged peers rather than with older men in imbalanced or predatory circumstances, as has been highlighted elsewhere. Young adolescents are often unprepared for sexual debut.

Practical matters : As with many other settings, menstrual hygiene is a serious problem. Girls have difficulty obtaining pads, washing and drying improvised cloths or pads (especially in the rainy season), or obtaining sufficient privacy at home or school. Boys are sometimes embarrassed by a lack of underclothes. Latrines and water are very limited in availability.

Gender norms and socialization : In this urban setting, there is a mix of communities who have migrated from different rural areas with their traditions for gender norms and initiation. Initiation experiences range from very traditional camps in rural home areas to participation in faith-based youth camps, the content of which can include some traditional elements. Parents in this urban setting do not necessarily see traditional gender roles as fixed - for example, not objecting to boys undertaking tasks traditionally reserved for girls such as sweeping. In common with parents the world over, they were not comfortable discussing sensitive matters like menstruation or sexuality with their children and would often send children to neighbors or relatives in the hope of explanations.

Aspirations : Young adolescents in these communities are full of hope and aspirations for the future.

## Curriculum

## GOALS

By participating in this 12-session curriculum, boys and girls will be able to:

- Recognize and question unequal relations of power and privilege that undermine very young adolescents' well-being;
- Recognize and challenge harmful gender norms in order to promote girls' agency and empowerment and boys' care and connection to others;
- Learn to appreciate the sexual and reproductive changes happening to their bodies in age-appropriate and 'body positive' ways; and
- Recognize violence and develop the skills to challenge and prevent it.

## THEORY OF CHANGE

## Learn

Through questioning and critically reflecting about gender norms, to develop new attitudes and skills

## Rehearse

Attitude and behavior changes, and new skills in safe environments of group education sessions

## Internalize

New gender attitutdes and norms

## Supporting Influences and Structures

Peer groups questioning and transforming gender norms together; role modeling of gender-equitable lifestyles, and taking action through advocacy in one's community and broader levels; institutions, structures, services, and policies support these changes

The figure above demonstrates our 'theory of change,' originally based on Promundo's theory of change for Program H and Program M. The overall goal of this curriculum is for very young adolescents to (1) learn through activity-based questioning and critical reflection about gender norms, (2) rehearse equitable and nonviolent attitudes and behaviors in a comfortable space, and (3) internalize these new gender attitudes and norms, applying them in their own relationships and lives. Supporting institutions and structures , when accompanying this integral group education process, allows youth as individuals and the organizations involved to have the tools to become agents of change for gender justice and social justice .

## Live

Gender-equitable, non-violent and healthy attitudes and behavior in everyday life in a sustained way. This contributes to positive outcomes such as increased condom use and improved SRH; and reduced STIs and HIV/AIDS, gender-based violence

In addition to this theory of change focused on the importance of challenging and redefining what it means to be a young girl or boy, this manual also incorporates a strong focus on social and emotional learning . According to experts, this form of learning 'enhances students' capacity to integrate skills, attitudes, and behaviors to deal effectively and ethically with daily tasks and challenges,' and it includes five core competencies (sourced from the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning): 4

- Self-awareness : The ability to accurately recognize one's own emotions, thoughts, and values and how they influence behavior.
- Self-management : The ability to successfully regulate one's emotions, thoughts, and behaviors in different situations - effectively managing stress, controlling impulses, and motivating oneself.
- Social awareness : The ability to take the perspective of and empathize with others, including those from diverse backgrounds and cultures.
- Relationship skills : The ability to establish and maintain healthy and rewarding relationships with diverse individuals and groups.
- Responsible decision-making : The ability to make constructive choices about personal behavior and social interactions based on ethical standards, safety concerns, and social norms.

## HOW IT WORKS

This is a 12-week program targeting Standard 6 students (ages 11 to 14) and informed by experts on early adolescent development, findings from the Global Early Adolescent Study, and a round of pilot testing in Malawi. Though the activities speak to Malawian youth, they are adaptable to almost any setting. The program is designed for implementation in mixed and single-sex groups as an after-school program using trained facilitators. It could also be implemented as part of the school curriculum. The curriculum is comprised of interactive activities, case discussions, collaborative projects, and discovery learning exploring gender inequalities and their consequences.

## The Role of the Facilitator

## HOW AND WHERE TO HOLD GROUPS

The duration of a group education program can range from a single discussion group to ongoing weekly sessions. The practice of conducting several sessions, with a brief rest period of a few days to a week between each session, seems to be the most effective; it allows participants time to reflect on and apply the topics discussed in real-life scenarios and then return to the group and continue the dialogue.

This curriculum consists of 12 sessions, each ranging from one to two hours. One study has shown that group education sessions lasting two or two-and-a-half hours per week for a period of 10 to 16 weeks is the most effective 'dose' with respect to sustained attitude and behavior change. 5 Other studies have shown an impact in terms of changing attitudes in just two to six sessions; however, a greater number of sessions allows for greater acceptance on the issues and provides more time during the week and between sessions to reflect on and discuss the issues with partners - all of which increases the likelihood of favorable results.

Groups of five to 15 participants are recommended. The creation of the groups will depend on the context in which the activities are implemented and on the particular characteristics of the participants. Working with large groups is not recommended because that can make it very difficult to conduct the sessions and achieve learning objectives in a confidential, intimate, and mutually supportive atmosphere.

The facilitator should know the demographics of the group beforehand in order to be aware and thoughtful about the different experiences and challenges pertaining to participants' experiences as young adolescents. In particular, they should be aware of participants' literacy level and adapt the exercises accordingly.

## WHO CAN BE A FACILITATOR?

A facilitator is not a teacher or instructor. He or she is not necessarily a subject matter 'expert,' though expertise is important. The facilitator is someone who can create a safe environment, someone who is a good listener, someone who wants to encourage discussion more than hear himself or herself speak.

That being said, many of the activities that are included in this manual touch on personal qualities and sensitive life experiences. Therefore, groups should be led by facilitators who are comfortable working with these issues, have experience in working with young adolescents, and have the support of their organizations and/or other professionals. Facilitators have a responsibility to create an open and respectful environment: an environment in which young adolescents can feel comfortable enough to share and learn from their own experiences and challenge long-held beliefs about sexual and reproductive health, violence, gender, and masculinity. The facilitator must also have the skills to handle conflicts that may arise.

It is critical that the facilitator has a solid foundation of the concept of 'gender,' as well as of the different social and health issues to be addressed during the sessions. As part of their training, facilitators must also go through a process of self-reflection about their own experiences and concerns with regard to gender, masculinity, and sexual and reproductive health. This will allow the facilitator to discuss these issues in a calm and open manner.

5 Barker, G., Ricardo, C. and Nascimento, M. (2007). Engaging Men and Boys in Changing Gender-Based Inequity in Health: Evidence from programme interventions . Geneva: World Health Organization.

Similarly, facilitators should be sensitive and responsive to the participants. The facilitator should be alert to the possibility that participants may require specific attention apart from the group and, in some cases, may require referral to professional services and guidance counseling.

Most of the group sessions are conducted in mixed groups of boys and girls, but some sessions require dividing the group into single-sex groups. Is it advisable to use male facilitators when working with groups of boys? In some contexts, boys prefer to interact with a male facilitator who will listen and, at the same time, serve as a model. However, other evidence suggests that the quality of the facilitator - the ability to mobilize the group, listen, and motivate them - is a more important factor than sex. One recommended possibility is to have both male and female facilitators working as a team to show that it is possible to work together and to model equality and respect. Nevertheless, it is not always possible to have more than one facilitator or to form a collaborative pairing, so it is advisable to train and utilize as many qualified persons as possible in advance who are willing, available, and motivated to lead a group process.

## THE ROLE OF THE FACILITATOR

You have an important role to play as a facilitator. Ask questions to better understand the participants and help them to reflect more. Remember: you are not an expert in gender or in sexual and reproductive health and rights. You do not need to have all the answers. The role of the facilitator is to create an open and respectful environment in which young adolescents can feel comfortable sharing and learning from one another.

Many of the themes are complex and sensitive. You need to pay attention to the comfort level of the participants. In some cases, you may need to refer individuals to professional services or counseling. It is important to be sensitive to the practical realities of the group members' lives and to understand that they may face challenges or dangers when trying to make changes.

Remember, changing attitudes and behaviors is a long process. Participation in these activities will not necessarily lead to an immediate transformation of young adolescents' lives and relationships. It is the beginning of a process for promoting personal change.

See your group as a process. Ask 'process questions,' or questions that cause participants to reflect more. These are questions that cannot be answered with a 'yes' or 'no' and that are unbiased.

## TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL FACILITATION 6

## Create a safe and equal space:

It is important for the group to be in a space where participants feel safe and comfortable. The facilitator(s) and the participants should sit in a circle during the discussions to encourage exchange and equality.

## Enforce the group agreement:

Ask participants to establish a group agreement (commonly known as 'ground rules') and enforce them throughout the activities. Important aspects of a group agreement include listening to and showing respect for others (for example, not talking when others are speaking and not making rude comments or talking on the phone); confidentiality; and participation.

6 Adapted from Program M: Working with Young Women ; informed by the Change-Makers Training Concern Liberia Facilitator Handbook; and prepared by Men's Resources International.

## Do not judge:

Remember: you are here to facilitate discussion and reflection. Your role is not to teach or punish anyone. Be friendly and create rapport with your participants. Be aware of your own position of power - avoid judgmental and authoritarian attitudes. Never impose your feelings or opinions on the group.

## Promote inclusion:

Ensure that all participants have the opportunity to speak. Be careful not to let one person dominate the conversation or make other people feel that they cannot share their own opinions.

## Address participants' concerns:

As a facilitator, you can engage the larger group in helping to propose solutions to the problems individuals are facing. Ask the group, 'How do you think this problem could be solved?' or, 'Has anyone faced a similar situation? What did you do?'

## Know and use referral services:

Some participants may prefer to discuss a particular topic, obtain information, or seek support outside of a group setting, or they may need attention from a specialized service provider. As a facilitator, you should be knowledgeable of resources to which you can refer participants if necessary.

## Manage conflicts respectfully:

If a conflict arises among the group, or if a participant shares a discriminatory view, remind the participants of the group agreement and keep it visible during the session. Also, encourage other members to help mediate the situation. Ask the group what they think about the question raised or how they would suggest handling the problem. When necessary, you can offer brief responses to questions to clarify misunderstandings.

## Appreciate honesty and openness:

Encourage participants to be honest and open. They should not be afraid to discuss sensitive issues for fear of ridicule from their peers. Thank the group members for sharing their personal stories. Never force anyone to participate in the activities.

## Promote movement and interaction:

Include as much physical movement as possible so that participants remain active, alert, and interested. Use short 'energizer' activities, such as songs or dances, in between activities in order to keep the participants engaged in the topics you are discussing.

## Manage your time:

Keep track of time. Keep in mind participants' attention spans and schedules.

## Pick an appropriate number of participants:

In order to ensure that the group is a safe and equal space, the number of participants should not be more than 15. Seven is ideal for everyone to have time to share and be heard. Smaller groups are also okay.

## Focus on the participants who are present:

If some participants don't show up, remind yourself to focus on the ones coming and not on the ones who are not. Even if only one participant arrives, focus on him and remind yourself that a good conversation with him about his life and relationships might mean a lot to him and his family. He might also recommend the next meeting to his friends.

## Meet the participants' pace:

This may be the first time that participants are hearing and thinking about some of these sensitive topics. Start at a slow pace in order for the participants to become familiar with the topics and to build trust in the group.

## Understand sensitive topics:

Many of the discussions include sensitive topics. Feel free to include case studies and examples from outside the region, if helpful, to destigmatize the issue.

## Stay on track:

While all discussions are welcomed, be sure to have a rule that can 'bank' or 'park' discussions that lead you off topic. Write 'Bank' or 'Parking Lot' on a sheet of paper and put it in a visible place in the room. Write down issues that veer off topic that the group can return to at a later time. If there is a feeling that a topic may be triggering other participants or creating undue harm, you can use this opportunity to 'bank' or 'park' that discussion as well.

## ICEBREAKERS AND ENERGIZERS

Icebreakers and energizers are intended to introduce more energy into the group when you have been discussing particularly sensitive issues for an extended amount of time. They are also meant to be fun and promote concentration. It is generally recommended to use energizers after coming back from breaks or between activities. Ask others in your group to create their own energizers. Ensure that icebreakers are culturally sensitive - for example, do not lead an icebreaker that involves touching if touching between men and women is inappropriate.

## Screamer

In a circle, people look at the ground. The facilitator says, 'Heads up,' and everyone looks into someone else's eyes. If two people are looking at each other, they scream and are both out. Continue to see who is last!

## Ha, Ha

Begin by having all the players sit in a circle. Tell all of the players they have to remain as solemn and serious as they can throughout the game. Pick one player to start the game, saying 'Ha' once. The player standing next to him or her says the word 'Ha' twice. Following this pattern, the third player says 'Ha' three times. As the game progresses, eliminate any players who laugh or make noise when it is not their turn. The player who avoids laughing throughout the game wins.

## Get in Motion

Ask group members to stand. Ask them to shake their right arm, then their left arm, then their right leg, and then their left leg. Now, tell participants that you will count to 10 while they shake each limb. They will shake their right arm 10 times, then their left arm 10 times, followed by their right leg 10 times, and their left leg 10 times - you can count out loud for each (from one to 10). As soon as participants have shaken each limb 10 times, go through the cycle again but only count to nine. Proceed, counting to eight, then seven, and so on until participants only shake each limb once. To make the energizer more exciting, you can count faster and faster as you go.

## The Rainstorm

Ask the group to stand in a circle with their eyes closed. Say that a rainstorm is approaching. Ask everyone to rub their palms against their pant legs. Then ask them to lightly pat their thighs with their fingertips. Ask them to do it harder. Now, ask them to pat their hands against their thighs. Start slapping your hands faster and faster against your thighs. After a while, go back to lighter slapping, then patting, and so on to reverse the whole order until it is quiet again and the storm has passed. ('At first, the wind was blowing the trees, then light rain started, then heavier rain, then a downpour, and then the whole thing faded away.')

## The Spaghetti

The group forms a tight circle. Everyone sticks their hands into the center. With one hand, everyone grabs the hand of another person. Then, using the other hand, they each grab a hand of someone different. The object of the game is to get untangled without letting go. By climbing, crawling, and wriggling around, participants can create one large open circle or, sometimes, two unconnected ones. If they are totally stuck, you can tell them they can undo one link and then reconnect once that person has turned around to see if that works. This energizer is fun and creates a nice physical bond between participants. It also subtly communicates ideas of working together to accomplish a task.

## The Shrinking Iceberg

Put a blanket or several sheets of newspaper on the floor. Ask the group to stand on it. Then explain that this is an iceberg that is melting away, reducing its size by half every month. Their objective is to see how long they can all stay on it. You ask them to get off it and fold the blanket in half or remove half the paper. Each time, reduce the area by half and see how they can find ways to support each other to allow everyone to stay on.

## Exercising

This activity is more basic than the others. Ask someone to lead the group in some simple stretching.

## PLANNING NOTES

This is the first session you will conduct with your group. It is important to set a warm and inviting tone so that everyone feels at ease to express themselves during today's session. To not lose time, prior to the session:

- Hang up the paper with the and on two different sides of the room
- Push desks or other tables against the wall (or put them outside the room) and place a circle of chairs in the center of the room
- (Optional) Play fun or relaxing music to create a positive environment

## Procedure:

## WELCOME (10 MINUTES)

- 1 Meet your young participants at the door as they walk in and greet them warmly. This shows them respect and also allows you to see what kind of mood they may be in on that particular day.
- 2 Once it is time to start, invite your participants to take a seat in the circle of chairs you have set up or to sit in a circle on the ground.
- 3 If there is time, lead a fun opening energizer with a song or dance.
- 4 Welcome everyone to the group by introducing the purposes of these sessions.

## Suggested Statement

Welcome and thank you for coming! You were invited to come to these after-school sessions because [fill in reason here]. In these sessions, we will talk about a lot of interesting things such as what it is like to be a young man and young woman in society, relationships, our emotions, and much more. The purpose of these sessions is to help you live happier and healthier lives. You will come to these sessions for 12 weeks. Does anyone have any questions?

- 5 Ask the participants to introduce themselves one by one by saying their name and age.
- 6 Thank everyone for introducing themselves.

## ICEBREAKER - IN MY BOAT (10 MINUTES)

- 7 Tell participants that they will now do an 'icebreaker.' Explain that an icebreaker is a fun activity to get to know one another better.
- 8 Have everyone stand up and form a circle.
- 9 Explain that one by one, participants can move to the inside of the circle saying, 'You are in my boat if…'and complete the statement by saying something personal about themselves. If a participant can say 'yes' to the sentence, then they take one step inside the circle. If they can say 'no,' then they stay where they are. Everyone must return to the circle before going onto the next participant.
- 10 Do the first sentence as an example. (For example, 'You are in my boat if your birthday is in May.')

## For the Facilitator: Other Examples You Can Use

## Low-Risk Statements

You are in my boat if…

- Your birthday is in May
- You're the oldest of your brothers and sisters
- You don't like to eat [popular food]
- You're ticklish under your arms

## Medium-Risk Statements

You are in my boat if…

- If you sometimes feel lonely
- If you are being bullied now
- 11 End the icebreaker with one final statement, 'You are in my boat if you feel like adults do not understand you.'
- 12 Smile and thank everyone for participating, and ask them to sit back down.
- 13 Say that this group will be a place to talk about issues such as this and how to prepare boys and girls such as themselves for adulthood.

## GROUP AGREEMENT (15 MINUTES)

- 14 Explain that this group will be a safe space where they will share personal stories and opinions. When someone shares, it is like a gift to the group. For this reason, we must create a safe space where everyone feels good about sharing these gifts.
- 15 On a new piece of flipchart paper, write 'GROUP AGREEMENT.'
- 16 Ask the group what sort of things must be in the group agreement to create a safe space. Give a few examples (see box below).

## Examples of Group Agreements

- Speak one at a time - When someone is speaking, everyone else should listen.
- Confidentiality - What is said in the group stays in the group.
- Change 'shoes' - Put yourself in the other person's shoes and respect other ways of seeing things.
- Equality - Everyone in the group has a voice and the right to speak, share, and contribute to the group.
- Have fun!

- 17 Gather a long list until the group runs out of ideas.
- 18 If there is time, have everyone sign their name on the group agreement to show their commitment to keeping a safe space.
- 19 Tell everyone that this group agreement will be in place until the very end of the group sessions.

## GENDER DEBATE (30 MINUTES)

- 20 Tell everyone to stand up in the center of the room.
- 21 Point to the two sheets of paper that you hung in the room. Explain that you will now read some sentences aloud. After you read each sentence, they will need to decide whether they agree with the statement or disagree. If they agree, then they will walk to the side of the room with the . If they disagree, they will walk to the side of the room with the . T o make it more fun, give the and the names.
- 22 To practice, provide an example sentence such as, 'Everyone should eat at least once a day. Do you agree or disagree?'
- 23 Ask everyone to walk to the side of the room that best represents their answer.
- 24 If needed, do one more example sentence before proceeding to the Gender Debate Sentences.

## Gender Debate Sentences

- Men should be leaders of the home.
- A woman's main role is to take care of the home and family.
- Real (young) men don't cry.
- It's a girl's responsibility to avoid getting pregnant.
- 25 Read the first sentence. Give them a few moments to think about the statement before choosing a side.
- 26 As they are choosing a side, tell them that there are no right or wrong answers.
- 27 Once everyone has selected a side, ask for a few volunteers to share their viewpoints on why they agree or disagree. DO NOT SHARE YOUR OWN OPINIONS. JUST LISTEN . However, do pay attention to the patterns in the responses. For example, do boys tend to answer in one way and girls the other? Ask the group why this might be.

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR TIP

If the participants become very excited and talk over each other, remind them of the group agreement. You may also use a pen or marker as a 'microphone,' with only the person holding the microphone allowed to speak at any one time.

- 28 After each side has shared their viewpoints, ask if anyone would like to change sides.
- 29 Ask everyone to come back to the center of the room. Read the next sentence.
- 30 Repeat until most (or all, depending on time) of the sentences have been read.
- 31 Ask everyone to sit back down in the circle.

- 32 Ask for a few volunteers to share how they felt doing this activity. How did it feel to listen to others who shared the different opinions? What surprised them about this activity?
- 33 Close the activity with the key message and give them the homework assignment. They will come back to the next session to share how it went.
- 34 Tell everyone that time is up, thank them for coming to the group, and say that you look forward to seeing them next week.

## PLANNING NOTES

There will be lots of discussion about gender roles and stereotypes in this session. Encourage participants to talk among themselves in small groups or pairs. When needed, refer back to the group agreement to promote a safe space. As much as you can, encourage everyone to speak at least once. Some participants may require more kind encouragement and attention than others. If at any point during the session you see the participants looking bored or losing energy, do a quick, fun energizer.

## Procedure:

## CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

- 1 Welcome everyone back to the group. Remember to smile and greet everyone at the door as they arrive.
- 2 Remind the group that in the last session they were given a homework assignment. Ask for a few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- How did they feel doing the assignment?
- What were the reactions from others?

## PART 1: THE WHIP (30 MINUTES)

- 3 Explain that in the last session they talked about the roles of men and women in society. Ask if anyone remembers the key message from that session, reminding them if necessary. Explain that today's session continues that discussion.
- 4 Using a 'whip' format, ask the young participants to give their responses quickly to the following phrases one by one as you move around the circle.
- 'Girls don't like boys who…'
- 'Girls don't like girls who…'
- 'Boys don't like girls who…'
- 'Boys don't like boys who…'
- 5 After each phrase, discuss the similarities and differences in the responses.
- 6 After you have gone through all the phrases, ask for a few volunteers to share how they felt doing this activity.

## PART 2: DRAWING ME! (30 MINUTES)

- 7 Distribute the handouts (located at the end of this session) as well as paper and pens/pencils to the group.
- 8 Explain the handouts. Ask the participants to complete the sentences. Then, they should make a drawing to show what they think is the best thing about being a girl or a boy.
- 9 Tell them that you will not collect the handouts after they are finished. This is for their personal use only, although you'd like four participants to volunteer to share their drawings at the end.

- 10 After 10 minutes, explain that they will come back to the circle.
- 11 Have them pair up with a partner and explain what they drew.
- 12 Have at least two boys and two girls share their drawings and sentence completions.

<!-- image -->

## ENERGIZER TIME! (5 MINUTES)

Do a quick energizer. Have a participant volunteer to lead a group song or dance that gets everyone up and moving around.

## GROUP DISCUSSION (15-20 MINUTES)

- 13 Discuss the following questions:
- For the boys: How did it feel listening to the girls as they were sharing their drawings?
- For the girls: How did it feel listening to the boys as they were sharing their drawings?
- Did you notice any differences between the girls' drawings and boys' drawings? (For example, point out if the boys mostly drew big cars and girls drew pots.)
- What is a stereotype?

## FACILITATOR TIP

One way to explain a 'stereotype' is 'the belief that all members of a group - for example, all girls or all boys - should think and act alike.'

- How do stereotypes hurt girls?
- How do they hurt boys?
- What can we do if we hear someone saying a stereotype about us as girls or us as boys?
- 14 Thank everyone for coming to the group again and close with the key message and homework assignment.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

Ignore those messages that say 'girls can't' or 'boys can't.' Girls and boys can do whatever they want as long as they prepare themselves.

## HOMEWORK

Think about all the things you would like to do or feel but are not allowed because you are a boy or a girl. Why do you think you cannot do them? Come back ready to share what you thought about in the next session together.

## PLANNING NOTES

During the group discussion, instead of sitting in a simple circle, the boys and girls will sit in a 'porridge bowl' format. Boys will sit in a circle together forming the 'porridge,' and girls will sit in a wider circle outside forming the 'bowl.' This format allows girls to listen to the boys' experiences and vice versa. For many boys, this will be the first time they are listening to the voices of girls. For this reason, it will be important to remind everyone of the group agreement, especially the importance of being respectful.

## Procedure:

## CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

- 1 Welcome everyone back to the group. Remember to smile and greet everyone at the door as they arrive.
- 2 Remind the group that in the last session they were given a homework assignment. Ask for a few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- How did they feel doing the assignment?
- What were the reactions from others?
- 3 Say that in today's session, they will talk about boys' and girls' roles in household chores.

## ALL AT THE SAME TIME ROLE-PLAY (30 MINUTES)

- 4 Ask the group, 'We all come from a home, right?' 'We all have chores to do to take care of the home, right?' 'What do we do to take care of the home?' Get participants to shout out the answers. If you have markers and a flipchart, write down their ideas.
- 5 Say that you will now play a fun role-playing game.
- 6 Divide the participants into three smaller groups. Give each group a fun name such as 'bananas,' 'oranges,' and 'pineapples.'
- 7 Tell the first group that their role will be to figure out which group is 'men with a home and family' and which group is 'women with a home and family.' However, they will have to step outside of the room for a few minutes to let the other two groups prepare.

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR TIP

If you have a co-facilitator, ask that they step out with the first group to play a quick game and/or further explain their role.

- 8 Give the other two groups their assignment.
- 9 Ask the two groups to imagine themselves in their role:
- To the group role-playing 'women with a home and family': What do women do to take care of the home and family from the time they wake up until the time they go to sleep?
- To the group role-playing 'men with a home and family': What do men do to take care of the home and family from the time they wake up until the time they go to sleep?
- 10 Tell them that they will have to use their actions and not their words for the role-play.

- 11 Say that you will call out different times of day: morning, afternoon, evening, and nighttime. They will have to role-play what men or women would be doing at that time (if anything at all). Give them one or two minutes to prepare.
- 12 Ask the third group to come in.
- 13 Tell the first two groups to move to opposite corners of the room. Repeat to the entire group that you are going to call out different times of day and they should silently carry out the activity that their character (either men with a home and family or women with a home and family) would do at that time.
- 14 Tell the third group that their role is to pay attention to the similarities and differences in the roleplays between the two groups.
- 15 Call out the different times of day: morning, afternoon, evening, and nighttime.
- 16 Ask everyone to sit back down in the circle.
- 17 Ask the third group to guess which group was playing the men and which group was playing the women. How did they know who was who?

## ENERGIZER TIME! (5 MINUTES)

Ensure that there are no empty chairs in your circle. Pick three fruits, such as bananas, oranges, and pineapples. Give each individual in the group a fruit name. Stand in the center of the circle and say, 'I am going to the market and I am going to buy \_\_\_\_,' and name a fruit. All of the people with that fruit name will have to run to a different seat - including you. The person without a seat will take your place and repeat the game again by saying, 'I am going to the market and I am going to buy \_\_\_\_.' Continue two or three more times.

## GROUP DISCUSSION (30 MINUTES)

- 18 Ask everyone to sit back in their seats but in a 'porridge bowl' format. Have the boys sit in a circle together forming the 'porridge' while the girls sit in a circle surrounding the boys like a 'bowl.'
- 19 Before you begin, remind everyone of the group agreement. In particular, ask the girls to keep their 'ears open but mouths closed.'
- 20 Ask the boys to share their thoughts on the following questions.

Important: Sharing is voluntary. If someone does not want to share, do not force him or her.

- What caught your attention most about the role-play?
- Who taught you (or where did you learn) that housework and caring for children are mainly a woman's job? Examples:
- At home: Parents tell girls to mop while boys sweep the yard.
- At school: Girls sweep the classrooms while boys dig the pits.
- From friends: Friends tease you if you are a boy doing typical 'girls' chores.'
- How do you think girls feel when they have to do more house and childcare work than boys?
- 21 After the boys have shared, look them in the eyes and thank them for sharing. Say that you have learned a lot.
- 22 Then, have them switch places with the girls.
- 23 Before you begin, remind everyone again of the group agreement. In particular, ask the boys to keep their 'ears open but mouths closed.'

- 24 Ask the girls to share their thoughts on the following questions:
- What caught your attention most about the role-play?
- Who taught you (or where did you learn) that housework and caring for children are mainly a woman's job? Examples:
- At home: Parents tell girls to mop while boys sweep the yard.
- At school: Girls sweep the classrooms while boys dig the pits.
- From friends: Friends tease you if you are a boy doing typical 'girls' chores.'
- What good things would happen if more boys were involved in the household chores and childcare?
- 25 After the girls have shared, look them in the eyes and thank them for sharing. Say that you have learned a lot.

<!-- image -->

## OPTIONAL ENERGIZER (5 MINUTES)

Do a quick energizer. Have a participant volunteer to lead a group song or dance that gets everyone up and moving around.

- 26 Ask everyone to come back to one large circle.
- For the boys: What did you learn as you listened to the girls?
- For the girls: What did you learn as you listened to the boys?
- Is it possible for a girl to study, do chores, and have fun? What kind of support does she need?
- Note: Some girls may say that they need to wake up earlier or spend less time playing. Encourage them to think of who can help them rather than additional burdens to take on.
- Is it possible for a boy to study, do chores, and have fun? What kind of support does he need?
- Note: Some boys will bring up that they will be teased if they do such chores. Ask participants what they can do if they see a boy being teased.
- 27 Thank everyone for their contributions and end with the key messages and homework.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

- No child is born knowing how to do house and childcare work. This is something society teaches us.
- This division in responsibilities often disadvantages girls because they miss out on opportunities boys have.
- Men and boys can also learn to care for children and do housework - and do it well!

## HOMEWORK

For the boys: Talk with your parents about one thing you would like to do to help around the house, such as helping with the cooking or cleaning. Ask if it would be okay for you to do it this week.

For the girls: Share one thing you learned with your parents about the burden of care and domestic work that women and girls have to do in the house. Discuss with your parents what they think about these ideas.

<!-- image -->

## PLANNING NOTES

This is a sensitive session during which many participants may share examples from their own life of how they have been treated violently or unjustly. Take care to remind participants of the group agreement, especially the parts about confidentiality and respect. You may also want to have referrals on hand for participants that you think may need extra support.

## Procedure:

## CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

- 1 Welcome everyone back to the group. Remember to smile and greet everyone at the door as they arrive.
- 2 Remind the group that in the last session they were given a homework assignment. Ask for a few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- How did they feel doing the assignment?
- What were the reactions from others?

## PERSONS AND THINGS (10-15 MINUTES)

- 3 Say that today you will all do a fun activity about power.
- 4 Tell everyone to close their eyes and take a few deep breaths. What comes to mind when they think about the word 'power'? What are the images they see? Give them one minute to think.
- 5 Ask participants to open their eyes and request for a few volunteers to share their thoughts.
- 6 Divide the participants into two groups and line them up on each side of an imaginary line. Each side should have the same number of participants so that everyone has a partner.
- 7 Choose one group to be the 'Persons' and one group to be the 'Things.'
- 8 Read the following instructions to the group:

Things: You cannot think, feel, or make decisions. You have to do what the Person tells you. If you want to move or do something, you have to ask the Person for permission.

Persons: You can think, feel, and make decisions. You can also tell the Thing what to do with hand gestures or words. NO physical touch.

Important: Consider asking two participants to demonstrate how a Person might treat a Thing before starting the role-play.

- Give the participants about five to 10 minutes to role-play.
- 9

Optional Step: Have the participants switch roles and let them role-play for another five minutes.

- 10 Ask participants to sit back down in the circle and proceed to the group discussion.

## GROUP DISCUSSION (40 MINUTES)

- 11 Ask the following questions:
- For the Things, how did your Person treat you? How did you feel? Would you like to have been treated differently?
- For the Persons, how did you treat your Things? How did it feel to treat them as an object?
- Note: If they switched roles, make sure all participants are asked both of these questions.

- 12 Break the participants into small groups of three to four people each. Write the following questions on flipchart paper and ask them to discuss them in their small groups.
- In your daily life, does anyone treat you like a Thing? Who?
- In your daily life, do you treat anyone like a Thing? Who?
- Why do people treat each other like this?

## Recommendations for Small Group Discussions

The participants may have difficulty in answering the above questions on their own. For example, they may start writing without discussing in the group first or may need additional clarification. Here are some ideas to support their discussions:

- Assign each group only one of the questions rather than all three. This would allow for a greater variety of answers and give them more time to discuss.
- Recruit volunteers from your community to help guide the small group discussions and offer more hands-on support.
- If there are enough facilitators, they should write the participants' answers on the flipchart paper while encouraging them to discuss the questions among themselves.
- 13 Tell the group to select one person who will present a summary of the discussion to the larger group.
- 14 After 10 to 15 minutes, ask for the groups to share a summary of their discussion.
- 15 Ask the final questions to everyone in the group:
- What bad things can happen when we treat others like Things? (Examples include anger and frustration, violence, depression, and sickness.)
- Can this activity help you make changes in how you treat others? How? What can you do to treat others better?
- 16 Thank the group for their contributions. Close with the key messages and homework.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

- We have all been treated like Things at one time or another.
- When one person treats another like a Thing, there are negative consequences. For example, in our society, girls are taught that they must obey their boyfriends at all times like Things. This can impact their health, putting them at risk for unplanned pregnancy, HIV and AIDS, or violence.
- We all have the power to make positive changes in our relationships.

## HOMEWORK

Make one change this week to treat others - whether it is a sibling, friend, neighbor, or someone else - not as Things but as People. What would this change be? Come back ready to share in the next session.

<!-- image -->

## PLANNING NOTES

Violence can be a sensitive topic to discuss. Above all, it is important to listen empathetically and do your best to maintain a safe and open atmosphere. Participants will model your behavior if you set a good example.

Be careful that you do not ask directly if someone has experienced violence, as this can create difficult situations in which participants may feel forced to answer. When exploring issues of violence, ask these questions more generally. Also, some settings require mandatory reporting in cases of disclosed violence. It will be important to create a protocol on how to handle such cases as they arise.

It is possible that participants will ask you lots of questions about violence and whether the example they give you is an act of violence or not. If you do not know, do not attempt to answer the question yourself. Rather, be open and throw it back to the group and ask what they think. In the end, say that you will consult with an expert and get back to them in the next session (if it is possible). Additionally, have a list of places where adolescents can seek services and/or report violence if they feel unsafe, including the national Child Helpline. Give a copy of the referral information to all group participants.

## Procedure:

## CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

- 1 Welcome everyone back to the group. Remember to smile and greet everyone at the door as they arrive.
- 2 Remind the group that in the last session they were given a homework assignment. Ask for a few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- How did they feel doing the assignment?
- What were the reactions from others?

## WHAT IS VIOLENCE? (20 MINUTES)

- 3 Explain that one of the ways 'People' treat or control each other as 'Things' is by using violence.
- 4 Ask participants what comes to mind when they think of the word 'violence'? If they say 'physical violence' or 'emotional violence,' ask them to give you an example.

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR TIP

If participants have a difficult time coming up with types of violence, ask, 'Is slapping someone a kind of violence?' If they say 'yes,' then write it on the board. Ask for other examples.

- 5 Gather a long list of ideas, writing them on a flipchart.
- 6 Provide the basic definitions of violence: 'At its most basic level, violence is a way to have control or power over another person or group.'

- 7 Explain the four types of violence in your words:
- 8 Pick one type of violence from the flipchart and ask the group what kind of violence it is. Keep picking from the list until you have one example for all four types of violence.
- 9 Ask if anyone has any questions.

| Physical Violence                   | Using physical force such as hitting, slapping, kicking, burning, or pushing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Emotional or Psychological Violence | Often the most difficult form of violence to identify. It may include humiliating, threatening, insulting, pressuring, and expressing jealousy or possessiveness (such as controlling decisions and activities). It can also include controlling a person's movements. This form of violence can be verbal or non-verbal.                   |
| Sexual Violence                     | Pressuring or forcing someone to perform sexual acts (from kissing to sex) against their will or making sexual comments that make someone feel humiliated or uncomfortable. Note : When people think of sexual violence, they often think of rape. Clarify that sexual violence can also be unwanted kissing, touching, or sexual comments. |
| Economic Violence                   | When someone else has complete control over a person's money and other economic resources. This type of violence is a way of exerting power and can be used to control someone's movements (for example, keeping them from meeting friends).                                                                                                |

## ROLE-PLAY (30 MINUTES)

- 10 Break up participants into small groups of three or four people each. Going one at a time, give each group a violence scenario to act out. Tell participants that the larger group will then have to guess what kind of violence is happening in the role-play.
- 11 Give groups about five minutes to prepare their role-plays.
- 12 Ask groups one by one to act out their scenario. After each group finishes their role-play, ask the rest of the group the following questions:
- What kind of violence was happening in this role-play? Why?
- What emotions do you think the person experiencing violence was feeling?
- What emotions do you think the person(s) using violence was feeling?
- 13 After all groups have gone, proceed to the group discussion questions.

## GROUP DISCUSSION (20-30 MINUTES)

- 14 Discuss the following questions with the participants:
- Were these role-plays realistic?
- Does a person ever 'deserve' to suffer from violence? Why or why not?
- What are the negative outcomes of using violence on girls? Boys? What are the impacts on families? Communities?
- What are some actions you can take to protect yourself from violence? (Examples: Say 'no' even if you know the person, run away from the violent situation and tell a trusted adult, do not take gifts, and shout loudly for help.)
- 15 Explain that in the next session they will talk about the importance of understanding our emotions to prevent using violence against other people.
- 16 Close with the key messages and homework.

## KEY MESSAGES

- At its most basic level, violence is a way to have control or power over another person. When people think of violence, they often think of physical violence. But there are many forms of violence.
- There are lots of negative outcomes for boys, girls, families, and communities when they experience violence.
- There are many ways to protect ourselves from violence.

## HOMEWORK

Create a list of things you can do to protect yourself from violence. This can include making an anti-violence club in school, refusing gifts from strangers, and telling an adult. Come ready to share this list in the next session.

## Session 5 What Is Violence?

## Violence Role-Play Scenarios

## FACILITATOR TIP

Choose no more than three role-plays. Adapt the situations to reflect the local reality.

## Role-Play #1: Zione and Mrs. Phiri

Zione is called into the teacher's office after class one day. The teacher, Mrs. Phiri, yells at Zione for turning in a poorly written homework assignment. She asks Zione why she even bothers coming to school and says she is a 'silly girl.' Zione stays silent and walks out of the room once Mrs. Phiri sends her away. What kind of violence is this?

## Role-Play #2: Tapiwa and Mabvuto

Tapiwa has been dating Mabvuto for a few months. They usually meet after school near the forest where no one can find them. Recently, Tapiwa's mother has been giving her extra house chores such as taking care of her younger brother and putting coal on the fire. For this reason, Tapiwa has been late to meet Mabvuto and he is becoming angry. He starts asking her questions all the time, such as whom she talks to in class and why she spends so much time with her girlfriends when she could be seeing him. Tapiwa has tried to not pay much attention to these questions, but lately Mabvuto has yelling at her at school and calling her names. Afterwards, he usually apologizes. He says he is upset because he loves her so much and she is 'driving him crazy' with jealousy. What kind of violence is this?

## Role-Play #3: Madalo and Thoko

Madalo and Thoko have a very creative and energetic 12-year-old son. However, he is always getting into trouble at school. Madalo's husband, Thoko, often blames her for their son's bad behavior, saying that she spends too much time outside when she should be at home. One day, Madalo and Thoko get into an argument, and he hits her. Hurt and angry, Madalo yells at her son, telling him that he is ungrateful and only brings her problems. What kind of violence is this?

## Role-Play #4: The Chikulunga

Every day after school, Enock plays football with his friends using a chikulunga. One day, Enock loses the chikulunga. The boys threaten that if he does not pay them, they will beat him every day until he has the money. The beatings have gotten so bad that Enock is afraid to leave school to walk home. What kind of violence is this?

## Session 6

## Procedure:

## CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

- 1 Welcome everyone back to the group. Remember to smile and greet everyone at the door as they arrive.
- 2 Remind the group that in the last session they were given a homework assignment. Ask for a few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- How did they feel doing the assignment?
- What were the reactions from others?

## UNDERSTANDING MY EMOTIONS (45 MINUTES)

- 3 Remind participants that in the last session they talked about violence and its negative impacts. Say that in this session they will talk about emotions and their connections with violence.
- 4 Ask participants the following:
- How do you know when you are sad (e.g., my energy feels low, I don't feel like going outside)?
- How do you know when you are happy (e.g., I am smiling, I feel like I can do anything)?
- 5 Explain that as they turn into adults, feeling moody or depressed one moment and happy the next is normal. However, this does not mean that our emotions have complete control over us.
- 6 Explain that many people confuse anger with violence. Make it clear to the group that anger is a natural and normal emotion that every human being feels at some point in life. Violence is a behavior, a way to express anger. But there are many other ways to express anger - more positive ways - than violence. It is important to learn how to express our anger rather than allowing it to bottle up inside us. When we allow anger to build up, we tend to explode. Additionally, healthier ways of expressing anger can lead to better results.
- 7 Explain to the group that you will now talk about how to react to anger.
- 8 Ask participants to relax and close their eyes. Say, 'Think of a situation when you were angry. It could be with a parent or with a friend. What happened? Don't say it out loud. Just think about it.' Give them a few minutes to think silently.

Optional Step: Pass out sheets of paper and pens/pencils to everyone in the group. Ask that they write one or two sentences about a situation in which they felt angry.

- 9 Next, say, 'In this situation, try to remember what you were thinking and feeling.'

Optional step: Alternatively, they can write down one or two feelings they felt when they were angry.

- 10 Say the following: 'Very often after we feel angry, we begin to react with violence. This can happen before we even realize that we are angry. Some men and women react immediately: shouting, throwing something on the floor, hitting something or someone. Sometimes, we can even become depressed and silent. Think about the incident when you felt angry. How did you demonstrate this anger? How did you behave?'

<!-- image -->

## Optional Step: They can write a sentence or a few words about how they reacted.

- 11 Divide participants into groups of four or five each at the most. Ask them to share what they wrote or thought about in the group. Allow 10 minutes for the group sharing.
- 12 Ask each group to brainstorm realistic and positive ways of reacting when we are angry with a partner or parent. Give them 10 minutes to brainstorm.
- 13 Ask each group to present their answers.
- 14 Use the box 'Positive Ways to React When I Am Angry' to give additional suggestions on how to resolve conflicts when we are angry.

## Positive Ways to React When I Am Angry

## Get Help from Others

Ask someone or a small group of people you trust to listen to the reasons you are angry and help come up with solutions to deal with these difficult emotions.

## Take a Breath of Fresh Air

To take a breath of fresh air is simply getting out of the situation of conflict and away from the person who is making you angry. You can count to 10, breathe deeply, take a walk, or do some kind of physical activity, trying to cool down and stay calm. You should also explain to the other person that you will go outside to take a breath of fresh air because you are feeling angry. For example, 'I'm really angry, and I need to take a breath of fresh air. I need to do something like go for a walk so I don't feel violent or start shouting. When I've cooled down, we can talk things over.'

## Use Words without Offending

To use words without offending is to learn how to express two things: to say to the other person why you are upset, and to say what you want from the other person without offending or insulting. For example, 'I am angry with you because…' and 'I would like you to…'

## ENERGIZER TIME! (5 MINUTES)

Ask a participant to lead the group in a high-energy dance party!

## GROUP DISCUSSION (25 MINUTES)

- 15 Discuss the following questions with participants:
- Is it difficult for young men to express their anger without using violence? Why? What about young women?
- Do we react differently when we are angry depending on the person we are angry with? How?
- Very often, we know how to avoid a conflict or a fight without using violence, but we don't do so. Why?
- Is it possible to 'take a breath of fresh air' to reduce conflicts? Do you have experience with this? How did it work out?
- Is it possible to use words without offending?
- 16 Close with the key messages and homework.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

- In general, boys and men in particular are socialized not to talk about feelings such as sadness and frustration. Very often, by not talking, the frustration or anger builds up until it is expressed through physical aggression or shouting.
- On the other hand, while girls are often more free to express some emotions, they might be discouraged from expressing anger.
- In the event of conflict, use words but don't offend.

## HOMEWORK

Create a list of things you can do to stop yourself from using violence against another person. What are the two most realistic things you can do? Come ready to share in the next session.

## PLANNING NOTES

Because this is mostly a single-sex session, it is recommended that you have a co-facilitator to lead one of the two groups. It is preferable, though not required as long as the facilitator is well trained and confident, to have a male facilitator lead the boys group and a female facilitator lead the girls group. It is highly recommended to leave enough time at the end of the session to bring both groups together to share what they discussed in the single-sex groups.

## Procedure:

## CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

- 1 Welcome everyone back to the group. Remember to smile and greet everyone at the door as they arrive.
- 2 Ask for a few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- How did they feel doing the assignment?
- What were the reactions from others?
- 3 Explain to the group that their minds and bodies are currently undergoing lots of changes. They are slowly becoming young adults! In the next few sessions, they will learn about the changes happening in their bodies.

## MINDFUL BREATHING (5 MINUTES)

- 4 In this single-sex session, ask everyone to get in a comfortable position sitting in a chair, sitting on the floor, or lying down.
- 5 Ask the group to close their eyes and focus their attention on their breath - the inhale and exhale. They should observe how the breath enters and leaves the body. Ask the group to notice what happens to their stomachs as they are breathing - you want the stomach to expand as you inhale more air and contract as you exhale it.
- 6 Tell them to breathe in slowly through their nostrils for three seconds, hold for one second, and breathe out through their mouth for four seconds. Do this several times until they feel completely relaxed.
- 7 Explain to the group that deep breathing helps to calm, relax, and focus us. If they are ever feeling strong emotions - fear, anxiety, nervousness, anger - taking a few deep breaths, and focusing on your breathing, can help.

## GETTING TO KNOW MY BODY (10 MINUTES)

- 8 Softly tell the group to keep their eyes closed, and that you will now read the names of body parts. They should either touch that part of the body or visualize it in their mind. Emphasize that they must keep their eyes closed and only do what they feel comfortable doing. Ask them to pay attention to how they feel as they either touch or visualize each part of the body.
- 9 In a slow and soft voice, say the following body parts: head, forehead, eyebrows, nose, mouth, cheekbone, lips, chin, ears, neck, chest, stomach, arms, hands, fingers, waist, genitals, buttocks, legs, knee, feet, and toes. Important: Use the common terminology for these parts of the body.
- 10 Notice the reactions of the group participants as they touch or visualize the various parts of the body. Stay alert during this step by observing participants' reactions as you read the various body parts.

- 11 Ask the group to breathe out slowly and open their eyes. Form a circle. Go to the group discussion.

## GROUP DISCUSSION (20 MINUTES)

- 12 Discuss the following questions with participants:
- What emotions did you experience as you were touching or visualizing the different parts of your body? Do you feel anything strange or uncomfortable in your body?
- Which part of the body was hardest to touch? Why?
- What types of concerns or doubts do you have about your body?
- Do girls/boys usually have a good relationship with their bodies? Why or why not?
- How can we build more positive relationships with our bodies?

## FACILITATOR TIP

After completing the discussions above, it is recommended to bring the boy-only and girl-only groups together for these final questions. Remind the group of the group agreement before proceeding.

If you feel it is safe, have a volunteer from each group share what they discussed in their boy-only and girl-only groups. Then ask these questions with the whole group (15 minutes):

- Do girls feel pressure for their bodies and faces to look a certain way? How so? Where does this pressure come from?
- Do boys feel pressure for their bodies and faces to look a certain way? How so? Where does this pressure come from?
- Why is it important for both girls and boys to have a good relationship with their bodies?
- 13 Ask everyone to stand up in a circle and hold hands. Tell them that they will take turns completing the following statement: 'My body feels strong when I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.' The statement should be positive. For example, 'My body feels strong when I dance' or, 'My body feels strong when I hug my mother.'
- 14 Thank everyone for their contributions. Explain that in the next session they will discuss changes in the body more deeply. Close with the key message and homework.

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

As girls and boys grow to become young women and men, they often feel lots of discomfort because their bodies are changing very quickly. This is normal! You may also feel pressure to start looking like an adult (for example, boys to have bigger muscles and girls to have bigger breasts). The way we feel about our bodies is connected to our overall well-being. Each body is special and unique, and we should feel good about them.

## HOMEWORK

This week, think about one or two things you can do to have a stronger, more positive relationship with your body. It could be telling yourself that your body is beautiful every morning or doing more of what you enjoy, such as playing ball outside. Do those things and come back to the next session ready to share.

## PLANNING NOTES

Puberty - and the physical and mental changes that accompany it - can be a very sensitive topic. You might not be used to talking about these topics openly. Practice this session a couple of times either with colleagues or by yourself before doing it with your group members. If you feel comfortable and are able to normalize these changes, then they will feel comfortable as well.

You as the facilitator are not expected to be an expert on puberty. Say 'I don't know' rather than come up with an answer that could be wrong. If possible, try to have information on where participants can get answers to their questions, such as at a health clinic. However, check that these places are friendly to young people . Some healthcare providers may discourage young people from seeking such information.

## Procedure:

## CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

- 1 Welcome everyone back to the group. Remember to smile and greet everyone at the door as they arrive.
- 2 Ask for a few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- How did they feel doing the assignment?
- What were the reactions from others?
- 3 Explain to the group that they will continue learning about changes happening in their minds and bodies.

## ENERGIZER (20 MINUTES)

- 4 Break up the participants into two groups.
- 5 Assign one group the name 'penis' and the second group the name 'vagina.'
- 6 Tell them that they will compete against each other. Whichever group can come up with the longest list of slang terms for their assigned word wins. Tell them that it's okay to write terms that they wouldn't typically use, so not to be shy.
- 7 Tell them one person should record all the terms on a piece of paper.
- 8 Give them two minutes to make their lists.
- 9 Ask each group to share their lists and declare the winner based on who has the longest list of slang terms.
- 10 Ask both groups to sit in a circle, and ask the following questions:
- How did you feel as you put these lists together? Embarrassed? Amused?
- Why do terms like this exist (e.g., want to sound 'cool' or 'tough,' to make others feel weak, or too embarrassed to use the correct terms)?
- How do you think it makes girls feel when these terms are used? And boys (e.g., embarrassed, angry)?
- 11 Agree with the group to use the correct biological terms for all body parts during these sessions. Using other words can make young men and women feel bad or make it seem like these are topics that shouldn't be discussed, and it can cause confusion. Using accurate terms for body parts means that you are well informed about the body.

## CHANGES IN MY BODY (40 TO 60 MINUTES)

- 12 Explain that lots of changes are happening right now to their bodies starting around 10 to 12 years old - not just to one area but everywhere. It can be difficult to understand why these changes are happening and if they are normal.
- 13 Brainstorm some of those changes happening in the body with the group. Ask them what changes might be happening to a boy and a girl as they are getting older. Probe them to think of changes that they cannot see.
- 14 Break up the group into teams of two to four people each. Give each group a flipchart paper and marker.
- 15 Explain that each group will draw the outline of either a girl or a boy. Tell each group what they will draw and ensure at least one group is drawing a boy and another is drawing a girl. They should have one member of the group lie down on the flipchart paper to do the outline of the body.
- 16 Once they complete the outline, they should draw or write down the changes they think are happening to different parts of the body.

Important : Keep the brainstorm open, but if they have trouble understanding your directions, give a couple of examples such as:

- The head: Thoughts are changing - want to spend less time with family, more with friends
- The underarms: Hair growing
- The genitals: Period starts, wet dreams, sexual feelings
- 17 After 10 to 15 minutes, have two groups (one who drew a girl and one who drew a boy) share what they drew. Ask the other groups who did not present if they have anything to add.
- 18 Ask participants how it felt to do this activity - what emotions or thoughts went through their minds?

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR TIP

Do not be afraid to bring in your own personal experiences of going through puberty. What did you dislike about the mind and body changes? What did you enjoy? Emphasize that these changes are a normal part of growing up.

- 19 Pass out the 'Changes in My Body' handout to all participants. Read out loud the general changes happening in the body using the handout.
- 20 Summarize the information in the 'Summary' box.

## Summary 10

Puberty is a time when the bodies of boys and girls change. Puberty happens because new chemicals - hormones - are developing in the body, turning young people into adults. Usually, puberty starts between ages 8 and 13 in girls and between ages 10 and 15 in boys, although some young people start puberty earlier or later. Typically, but not always, girls begin puberty about two years before boys. During puberty, a girl becomes physically able to become pregnant, and a boy becomes physically able to father a child. Although the physical ability to have a baby is there, it does not mean she is ready to have a baby or that he is ready to be a father, only that they are physically capable of creating and having a baby. It is not healthy for young girls to have babies because their bodies have not finished growing. If you are concerned about your body, ask to speak with a trusted adult or health provider.

- 21 Have everyone stand together in a circle. Tell them to look around at each other. They are all roughly the same age, but it is apparent that they are all in different stages of puberty. This is normal, and every person's body is unique and special.
- 22 If there is time, have them say a personal affirmation before closing with the key message, such as, 'My body is special and strong.'
- 23 Thank everyone for their participation and close with the key message and homework.

## KEY MESSAGES

Puberty is a time when the bodies of boys and girls change. Not only are physical bodies changing but so are minds - feelings, ways of seeing things - and relationships. This is a completely normal part of growing up. Learning and talking about these changes with people you trust can make you feel safer and more confident during this time.

## HOMEWORK

Ask them to come back to the next session with a list of features of puberty that they like and features that they do not like. They should be prepared to share this.

Special treats such as lollipops or pencils (optional) to encourage participation

If resources allow, locally available sanitary pads such as handmade reusable cloths made by local mothers' groups, menstrual cups that can be purchased at local stores, reusable pads, and disposable pads

<!-- image -->

## PLANNING NOTES

This session complements the previous sessions on the body by providing additional information on physical changes happening in very young adolescents. As a facilitator, you are not a sexual and reproductive health expert, so do not be afraid to say, 'I don't know the answer, but I will find out for you' or, 'Here is a place where you can go to get information about that.'

## Procedure:

## CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

- 1 Welcome everyone back to the group. Remember to smile and greet everyone at the door as they arrive.
- 2 Ask for a few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- How did they feel doing the assignment?
- What were the reactions from others?
- 3 Explain that today you will continue learning about the changes happening in the body during puberty.

## MIND AND BODY BRAINSTORM (20 MINUTES)

- 4 Ask participants what they did and learned in the last session. Tell the group that hygiene is important to ensure bodies and minds grow and develop in a healthy way. Based on the handout and the flipchart work, ask the same small groups to brainstorm solutions to one of the following topics:
- Ways to keep your body clean and healthy
- Ways to keep your mind and emotions healthy and balanced

If needed, you can have half the full group brainstorming ideas for the body and the other half brainstorming ideas for emotions.

- 5 Have the groups share. Add any of the following if they have not been said:

## Body Brainstorm Suggestions

- Wash and bathe the body daily using soap and clean water
- Using items such as reusable cloth towels or disposable sanitary pads during menstruation
- Wash face with soap and water twice a day

## Mind Brainstorm Suggestions

- Talk to trusted adults about problems you are facing
- Write problems down in a journal

- 6 Ask if the ideas presented sound realistic, and how they could overcome barriers to keeping minds and bodies healthy (e.g., lack of access to sanitary pads or soap).

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR TIP

It is possible that very few girls will know what sanitary pads are. Explore locally available sanitary management resources and bring them into this session. Alternatives to sanitary pads include handmade reusable cloths made by local mothers' groups, menstrual cups that can be purchased at local stores, and reusable pads that can be purchased from the head teacher's office or a local mothers' group. Disposable pads can be purchased from the store.

## STORIES ABOUT PUBERTY (45 MINUTES)

- 7 Explain you will read a few different stories about boys and girls their age. They will have to figure out what is happening in the story.
- 8 Read or have volunteers role-play the first story: 11

## STORY #1 ABOUT A BOY NAMED [INSERT TYPICAL NAME OF A BOY HERE], AGE 11

Last week, I had a dream about a girl that I really like. I was feeling very happy in the dream because I was close to her. When I woke up, I found my clothes and bed sheets were wet and sticky. I had to take a bath. Later, I thought about what came out of me and became worried. Is there something wrong with me? What is happening?

- 9 Ask for a few volunteers to share what they think is happening. If participants do not volunteer, ask them to pair up with a person whom they trust to discuss what is happening. Ask for a few volunteers.
- 10 Respond with the following:

## ANSWER TO STORY #1

Note: As you explain what is happening, refer to the flipchart with the male anatomy. Ask them to follow along using their handouts .

This boy is experiencing what is called a 'wet dream.' A wet dream is when a boy ejaculates (or releases) sperm during his sleep. Many boys experience their first ejaculation during sleep. This boy woke up with his clothes and bed wet and sticky with semen. This is completely normal. Wet dreams will stop as he gets older.

This does not mean he is ready for sex because it can cause pregnancy while the boy is still a child himself.

- 11 Ask the group what advice they can offer a male friend if he experiences a wet dream. For example, he can take a quick bath with soap and change his clothes before going back to bed.

11 Some of the stories are adapted from Sommer, M., Likindikoki, S. and Kaaya, S. (2013). Kuwa Kijana: To become a young man. Grow and Know. Dar es Salaam: Sisi Illustrators.

- 12 Read or have a couple of volunteers role-play the second story:

## STORY #2 ABOUT A BOY NAMED [INSERT TYPICAL NAME OF A BOY HERE], AGE 10

I was sitting in the classroom today and felt my penis becoming very stiff and straight. I did not know what to do so I sat there until it went back to normal. I went to the toilet to pee to make sure everything was okay. I do not want to tell anyone because I am ashamed. Do you know what it means?

- 13 Ask for a few volunteers to share what they think is happening.
- 14 Respond with the following:

## ANSWER TO STORY #2

Note: As you explain what is happening, refer to the flipchart with the male anatomy. Ask them to follow along using their handouts.

This boy is experiencing an erection. An erection occurs when the penis fills with blood and becomes hard and straight. Erections sometimes happen when boys think about sexual things or for no reason at all! Boys do not have control over when this will happen. It is common for boys to have an erection when they wake up in the morning. In the evening, a penis can become erect several times in the night while he is sleeping. Boys will find it difficult to urinate until their penis goes back down.

- 15 Ask what kind of advice they can offer a male friend if he experiences an erection out of the blue. For example, he can put a book in front of himself until it goes away or concentrate on something else.

## STORY #3 ABOUT A GIRL NAMED [INSERT TYPICAL NAME OF A GIRL HERE], AGE 12

Today I came home from school and found a dark brown stain on my underwear. I have no clue what it could be so I changed my underwear and ignored it. A few hours later when I went to the bathroom, the stain appeared again. What is happening? Am I sick?

- 16 Ask for a few volunteers to share what they think is happening.

## ANSWER TO STORY #3

Note: As you explain what is happening, refer to the flipchart with the female anatomy. Ask them to follow along using their handouts.

This girl is experiencing her first period. It usually happens every month as part of a woman's menstrual cycle. It signals that the body is now capable of becoming pregnant. A period is also known as 'menstruation' and occurs when blood and tissue from a woman's uterus come out of her vagina. Inside the body, the blood and tissue form a lining in the uterus that is a soft place for the egg to land if it meets with the sperm to become a baby. The lining has lots of nutrients to help a baby grow. If the egg does not meet with the sperm, then the lining is not needed and the body sends a signal to shed the tissue through the vagina. And that's your period! It can last from four to seven days.

Just because a girl has her period it does not mean she is ready to become a mother. In fact, it can be dangerous to a girl's health if she becomes pregnant at an early age.

- 18 Ask what kind of advice they can offer a female friend if she experiences her period for the first time. For example, she can purchase and use a sanitary pad or find out how to make one in order to protect her clothing.

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR TIP

As you go through the female reproductive system, some of the youth may have questions about the clitoris. In many cases, youth may already have some rudimentary information. The best approach in these situations is to be open and honest about its function, which is to provide pleasure during sexual intercourse.

- 19 With a couple of the people sitting next to them, ask everyone to share one important thing they learned today. Have one person be the 'reporter' and share with the larger group one or two things their small group learned.
- 20 Thank everyone for participating and ask if they have any questions. If possible, refer them to a place such as a local health clinic where they can get more accurate information about the sexual and reproductive system.
- 21 End with the key message and give out the homework.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

Puberty is a time when the body is becoming an adult. It shows that one day you will be able to have a family of your own. However, just because you are capable does not mean that you are ready to have a baby or have sex. Instead, appreciate being young and the changes happening to your body.

## HOMEWORK

Review the 'Reproductive Systems' handout. Read through the different parts of the body with an adult, if possible. Share what you have learned today with your parents. Take time to ask them what they remember about being your age. What changes were happening with them at the time? How did they feel about these changes?

## Session 9 Reproductive Systems Handout

## Internal Female Reproductive System 12

<!-- image -->

The woman's reproductive system includes a group of organs in the woman's belly and lower pelvis.

The uterus is where the fetus, or baby, grows.

A woman has two ovaries - one on either side of the uterus. Ovaries make eggs and hormones like estrogen and progesterone . These hormones help girls develop and make it possible for a woman to have a baby. The ovaries release an egg as part of a woman's cycle. When an egg is released, it is called ovulation . Each egg is tiny - about the size of a grain of sand. However, boys and girls at your age are too young to have babies. It is not healthy for growing bodies.

Fallopian tubes go from the uterus to the ovaries. When an ovary releases an egg, it travels through these tubes.

The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens into the vagina. During childbirth, the cervix expands so the baby can travel from the uterus into the world.

The vagina is a tube that connects the uterus to the outside of the body.

## External Female Reproductive System 13

The opening to the vagina is a hole between a woman's legs.

Above the vaginal opening is the urethra (where pee comes out), and below is the anus (where poop comes out).

The clitoris is a small, sensitive sensory organ just above the vagina. Its purpose is to give a woman physical pleasure.

The labia majora are two flaps of skin that surround the labia minora and vagina. The labia minora are the two inner flaps that surround the opening of the vagina. The labia protect the opening of the vagina.

## Session 9 Reproductive Systems Handout

## Male Reproductive System 14

<!-- image -->

The male and female reproductive systems work together to produce a baby.

The bladder is a sac that stores urine (pee) until it is released through the urethra.

Near the bladder are the two seminal vesicles . The seminal vesicles secrete a thick fluid that nourishes the sperm.

The prostate gland surrounds a portion of the urethra and produces some of the fluid in semen.

Next to each testicle is the epididymis , where sperm is stored. From here, the sperm are transported to the vas deferens.

The van deferens is a tube that transports the sperm from the epididymis to the urethra.

The urethra is the tube that carries sperm and urine out of the penis. Sperm and an egg from a woman make it possible to make a baby. However, boys and girls your age are too young to have babies. It is not healthy for growing bodies.

The scrotum hangs under the penis and contains the testicles and epididymis . The two testicles produce sperm and a hormone called testosterone .

The penis is made up of two parts: the shaft (the main part) and the glands (the tip, sometimes called the head). The penis delivers the sperm through the urethra.

## PLANNING NOTES

This is a sensitive session that requires girls and boys to talk about their intimate feelings about emotional, physical, and sexual attraction. Ensure that you remind participants of the group agreement. Creating a safe and comfortable space will allow participants to share their viewpoints more honestly.

Notice the differences in how boys and girls share feelings or emotions of attraction and point this out throughout the session. Ask them why it is that they see relationships differently. Support them to come up with solutions on how to have relationships - any kind of relationships - based on equality and respect.

## Procedure:

## CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES - MIxED GROUP)

- 1 Welcome everyone back to the group. Remember to smile and greet everyone at the door as they arrive.
- 2 Ask for a few volunteers to share any questions they had after reviewing the 'Reproductive Systems' handout from the homework in the last session. What surprised them as they read through the handouts?

## NEW ATTRACTIONS (20 MINUTES - BOYS-ONLY/GIRLS-ONLY GROUPS)

- 3 Explain to the group that in this session they will talk about how their changing bodies and minds have an impact on their relationships with other people - not just on themselves.
- 4 Break up participants into boys-only and girls-only groups. Ensure there is one facilitator per group.
- 5 Ask participants to pick a spot on the ground and sit down.
- 6 Tell them to take a long breath and exhale slowly while saying the word 'relax' silently.
- 7 Tell them to close their eyes and take 10 natural, easy breaths. Count down with each exhale. As they breathe and count down, ask them to notice any tension or tightness they might be holding onto on their forehead, jaw muscles, or stomach. Tell them to imagine those tensions loosening.
- 8 When they reach 'one,' proceed to the next step.

## Optional: Play calming music in the background as you do the breathing exercise.

- 9 Ask participants to keep their eyes closed and recall a situation when they felt a special affection or attraction towards another person. Say that it is important to think of a situation where the attraction was exciting and pleasurable for them. Ask questions to help them think but do not ask them to respond. They should just think about your questions .
- How did you meet this person? Are they in your grade? Are they a neighbor?
- What did they look like? Tall? Short?
- What were they like? Nice? Funny? Quiet?
- How did you feel in your body when you were around this person? Happy? Nervous?
- How would you feel now if that person were right next to you? Excited? Nervous?

If they cannot think of anyone, it is okay! They can also simply sit quietly and think about the questions.

- 10 Give them two minutes to think about the situation.
- 11 Ask participants to take a few deep breaths and open their eyes.
- 12 Ask for a few volunteers to share what they imagined.

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR TIP

Do not ask for names of people whom they have feelings for. Positively affirm those who do share, however. Ask if others have similar or different situations to share. Getting boys to talk can be especially challenging. Facilitators moderating the boys' session should take time to share their own, sometimes awkward, experiences of attraction or tell a few jokes to make them feel at ease.

- 13 Proceed to the group discussion questions.

## GROUP DISCUSSION #1 (20 MINUTES - BOYS-ONLY/GIRLS-ONLY GROUPS)

- 14 Discuss the following questions:
- When girls/boys have crushes on - or romantic feelings for - other people, why are those experiences positive or pleasurable to them?
- What emotions do girls/boys feel as they think about their crushes?
- 15 Summarize the discussion by saying that during puberty, it is normal to become aware of the other sexes and for feelings to become romantic, even sexual.
- 16 Ask if girls and boys show their emotions in the same way or in different ways when they like someone. Have a few volunteers share their thoughts. Don't respond with your opinions.
- 17 Bring the groups back together.

## ENERGIZER TIME! (5 MINUTES)

Ask a participant to lead the group in a high-energy dance party!

## RELATIONSHIP ROLE-PLAY (20 MINUTES - MIxED GROUP)

- 18 Once they are in a mixed group, tell them that they will do a role-play. Boys will role-play how girls typically act when they like somebody. Girls will role-play how boys typically act when they like somebody.
- 19 Ask everyone to form groups of two to three people each. Give them five to 10 minutes to practice their role-plays.
- 20 Depending on time, have two or three groups present their role-plays to the entire group.
- 21 After each role-play, ask the boys, 'Did the girls get it right or wrong? What did they miss?' Ask the girls, 'Did the boys get it right or wrong? What did they miss?'
- 22 Thank the groups and proceed to group discussion #2:

## GROUP DISCUSSION #2 (20 MINUTES - MIxED GROUP)

- 23 In the role-plays, what are the differences you saw in the way boys and girls express their romantic or sexual feelings? (Examples: In the role-plays, boys offer money to girls to show they can take care of them; girls are always being proposed to while boys typically do the asking; boys touch girls in private areas to let them know they like them.)
- 24 Where did we learn how to start relationships like this, where girls are passive and boys are aggressive? (Examples: From parents, watching TV, the Bible, or aunties.)
- 25 Why could these ideas cause problems for girls? For boys? (Example: If girls are taught that they have to be asked to be in a relationship and boys are taught to be aggressive, this can lead boys to treat girls like 'Things' rather than 'Persons'; girls who refuse to be in relationships with boys who like them have been sexually assaulted or abused.)
- 26 What are the benefits to wait to have sexual intercourse until you are much older?
- 27 Sometimes these feelings of attraction can be overwhelming! What can we do when we have these feelings? (Examples: Respect and acknowledge those feelings because they show you are growing up; talk to a friend or trusted adult about it; or take your mind off of the feelings by playing outside with friends.)

## FACILITATOR TIP

The topic of masturbation may come up during this discussion. At this age, adolescents may be experimenting with their own bodies in ways that bring them pleasure. It is important to acknowledge that masturbation is a perfectly normal way to express our feelings. Tell participants that such exploration is healthy while at the same time emphasizing the importance of waiting to have sex until they are older and their bodies and minds have matured. Some adults, or even your church, might say this is not okay. It is up to the participants to decide what they agree with, but it's important that they are careful.

- 28 What important things did you learn in this session about relationships?
- 29 Why is it important to treat others with respect and equality?
- 30 End with the key message and give the homework assignment.

## KEY MESSAGES

During puberty, you are starting to feel new emotions towards other people - sometimes romantic, sometimes sexual. Your body is showing that it is becoming more adult. These changes are completely normal. But your bodies and minds are still growing, and it is best to wait until one is older to act on those feelings. Above all, it is important to treat one another with respect and equality.

## HOMEWORK

Looking back at the past 10 weeks, what are the changes you want to make not only in your relationships with your friends and family but also in your school? What role could you play in making school a happier and healthier place? Doing dramas? Writing a letter to the Ministry of Education about the state of your school? Come back to the next and last session with one or two ideas.

## PLANNING NOTES

Early childbearing has lots of consequences for young girls. Both girls and boys face financial, emotional, and relationship challenges such as dropping out of school, inability to find work to support a new baby, and lack of support from the family, among other challenges. Babies born to young mothers have lower birthweights, poorer nutrition, and potential developmental challenges.

## Procedure:

## CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

- 1 Welcome everyone back to the group. Remember to smile and greet everyone at the door as they arrive.
- 2 Remind the group that in the last session they were given a homework assignment. Ask for a few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- How did they feel doing the assignment?
- What were the reactions from others?

## ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY ROLE-PLAY (45 MINUTES)

- 3 Tell participants that they have learned a lot about the changes happening in their bodies, including how they will someday be able to become mothers and fathers. But some young people become parents too early.
- 4 Ask if they know anyone who became a parent too early. What were the impacts on the girl? The boy? The parents? Get several volunteers to open up the discussion.
- 5 Explain that they will now break into two girls-only groups and two boys-only groups. Choose the groups.
- 6 Once everyone is in groups, explain the role-play assignment. Give them lots of examples:

Girl Group #1: Prepare a five-minute role-play on the changes that happen to an adolescent girl when she becomes pregnant (body and mood changes). How would she feel (emotionally), and what would be the impact on her dreams for the future?

Girl Group #2: Prepare a five-minute role-play on the changes that happen to an adolescent girl once she has a baby. How would this impact her life (financially, relationships, etc.)?

Boy Group #1: Prepare a five-minute role-play on the changes that happen to an adolescent girl when she becomes pregnant (body and mood changes) and how would she feel emotionally. How would the male partner feel?

Boy Group #2: Prepare a five-minute role-play on the changes that happen to an adolescent girl and her male partner once they have a baby? What would be the impact on their lives?

- 7 After giving the assignments, go around to each group and make sure they understand the assignment.
- 8 Give each group about five minutes to present their role-plays.
- 9 Give lots of positive encouragement following the completion of each role-play.
- 10 Have everyone return to a seated circle.

## GROUP DISCUSSION (30 MINUTES)

- 11 Discuss the following questions:
- How did you feel as you acted out your role-play?
- What did you see happens to a girl when she becomes pregnant too soon? A boy?
- How does having a baby affect the girl's and boy's dreams for the future?
- Are boys and girls affected in the same way by pregnancy? Why? What are the differences we see?
- In your group of friends, do you ever talk about pregnancy? What do you talk about?
- What are some reasons why boys and girls your age should delay sex until you are older and fully ready?
- What can we do to help each other to prevent early pregnancy?
- 12 Close the session with the key message and homework.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

- It is important to delay sex until you are fully ready and in a relationship with someone you love.
- Early pregnancy can prevent young people from achieving their dreams for the future and can hurt their relationships with friends and family.
- There are lots of consequences for girls' health when they become pregnant too soon.
- It is important to work together to prevent pregnancy.

## HOMEWORK

Write two or three future dreams you would like to achieve by the time you are grown up. For example, would you like to be a teacher? Have a taxi business? How would having a baby right now impact your dreams? Come ready to share in the next session.

## PLANNING NOTES

As the group is coming to an end, begin planning ways to keep them connected after the sessions are over. Are there other school- or community-based activities that could further support their growth and development? This session will focus on developing action plans to make their spaces more gender-equitable. It will be good to prepare beforehand how you and your colleagues will be able to support these actions over the next couple of months as youth begin to live out their changes.

If there is time, it would also be a good idea to invite parents and teachers (optional) to this last session and have the students prepare one big role-play about everything they have learned over the past several months. It is also recommended to invite recognized leadership figures such as a school principal, faith leader, and/or government officials to say a few words recognizing the growth and promise of your young group members.

## Procedure:

## CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

- 1 Welcome everyone back to the group. Remember to smile and greet everyone at the door as they arrive.
- 2 Ask for a few volunteers to share their experiences from the last homework session. What ideas did they brainstorm?

## MY WORLD, MY FUTURE (1 HOUR)

- 3 Explain to that the group that this will be the last session they have together. Throughout these past weeks, they have had the opportunity to learn and explore lots of different issues facing young people today, including sexual and reproductive health, how to end violence, and gender inequality. In this session, they will begin thinking about how what they learned will help them to make their school a happier and healthier place.
- 4 Going around the circle one by one, have participants share their ideas for improving their school environment. Write these on flipchart paper. As much as possible, try and condense the ideas, as there may be some repetition.
- 5 Have each of the participants come up and put an 'I' mark next to the idea they like the best. The one with the most tallies will be the action they will carry out.
- 6 Together, have them brainstorm:
- What is their main message? What do their peers need to know?
- Whom will they target? Other Standard 6 students? Older or younger students? Teachers? Government?
- What activities can they carry out?
- When and how often?
- What resources and support will they need?
- 7 Work with them to develop a short plan to implement their action.
- 8 Offer your support to make it happen.

## THE WEB - 20 MINUTES

- 9 Grab the ball of string and ask participants to stand in a circle shoulder to shoulder.
- 10 Explain that they will be throwing this ball of string to each other in the circle. However, they will have to hold on to one end of the string and toss the ball to the next person. Before they do so, they will answer the following question, 'How will this group help you to become the person you want to be in the future?'
- 11 Hand the ball of string to a volunteer that will answer the question. After they have answered, they will hold on to the end of the string and toss the ball.
- 12 By the time all participants have answered, a spider web will have formed.
- 13 Explain that they are all strongly connected because of the experiences they have shared in this group. Give them a moment to appreciate one another.
- 14 Ask the invited community leader to come and say a few encouraging words about the importance of their growth over the past several months.
- 15 As noted in the Planning Notes, it would also be ideal for youth to prepare a role-play about all that they have learned in this program and/or how they will create change in their school/communities.
- 16 Hand out completion certificates (optional) and close with the key messages.

## KEY MESSAGES

- Over the past several months, you have grown and achieved so much. Now it is up to you to work within your schools, with your parents and friends, to support a more equal future.
- Creating a vision for the future helps guide the decisions you make today.
