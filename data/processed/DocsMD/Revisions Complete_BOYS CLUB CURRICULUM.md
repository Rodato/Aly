## Acknowledgements

The Boys' Club for Gender Equality Implementation Guide , and other Lifting Barriers global resources were developed with support from the Global Partnership for Education's Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE-KIX), a joint endeavor with the International Development Research Centre, Canada. The Lifting Barriers project, launched in August 2024, aims to understand how harmful and restrictive masculine gender norms undermine boys' motivation and learning and what conditions facilitate the development, successful implementation and scaling-up of strategies to advance positive and inclusive masculinities in and through education.

Cody Ragonese and Jane Kato-Wallace from Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice developed the ' Lifting Barriers ' resources with support from UNESCO and University of East Anglia.

## Glossary of Terminology

Boys' disengagement from education is understood as a gendered phenomenon partly rooted in societal norms and concepts of masculinity, which can lead boys and young men to consciously or unconsciously to withdraw from education. Additional social, economic and cultural factors, in families, communities and schools, may also lead to boys' low engagement with education and contribute to school leaving/dropout. Disengagement from education can manifest in different forms such as lack of interest, poor participation, absenteeism, neglecting homework or exam preparation and ultimately, dropping out (UNESCO, 2022a).

Curriculum (Plural: Curricula) is an inventory of activities related to the design, organization and planning of an education or training action, including definition of learning objectives, content, methods (including assessment) and material. In simple terms, a description of what, why, how and when students should learn (UNESCO-IIEP, n.d.; UNESCO-IBE, 2013).

Disadvantage in education refers to the intersecting social, economic, cultural, or structural conditions that limit educational access, participation, and outcomes. Disadvantage can lead to particular groups (e.g. boys or girls) having lower enrolment, retention and completion rates, and poorer educational outcomes, including subject mastery and attainment.

Discrimination is an unfair treatment or arbitrary distinction based on a person's race, sex, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, age, language, social origin or other status (UNESCO, 2022b).

Drop-out or school leaving refers to leaving school before the completion of a given stage of education or leaving at some intermediate or non-terminal point in a cycle of schooling. It can be temporary or definitive and can be the result of an active decision made by the learner or the result of push and/or pull factors (based on UNESCO-IIEP, n.d.)

Educational space is a space where teaching and learning takes place. It can be inside or outside the school, physical or virtual. This can include classrooms, libraries, community spaces (e.g. youth centers), as well as e-learning platforms.

Gender refers to the culturally defined roles, attributes, behaviours, identities and expectations associated with being male or female in a given context. It shapes how individuals act and interact, and the distribution of power and resources in relationships and society. Gender can be expressed through male, female, and non-binary identities and may or may not be congruent with the sex assigned to an individual at their time of birth . (based on UNESCO, 2022b).

Gender-based violence refers to violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering, against someone based on gender discrimination, gender role expectations and/or gender stereotypes, or based on the differential power status linked to gender (UNESCO, 2022b).

Gender equality in education means that the right to education of all learners is respected equally regardless of gender. Learners of all genders are given equal access to learning

opportunities, resources and protections, and learners of all genders benefit from and are treated in education equally (based on UNESCO, 2019a). Gender equality through education refers to education's key role in addressing the wider issue of gender equality. Educational institutions can promote equitable attitudes, changing the way people think about traditional gender roles and helping to build long-term sustainable change. And achieving equal outcomes for female, male and non-binary learners can help to empower all people to create better lives (UNESCO, 2019a). Gender norms are understood as ideas about how men and women should behave: the expectations and standards that are set for each gender in different societies, cultures and communities. They are both context- and time-specific. People internalize these 'rules' at an early age, in the beginning of a cycle of gender socialization and stereotyping that continues for the rest of their lives. Gender norms thus not only become individuals' expectations of others, but also of themselves. Gender norms can be harmful, such as those that limit individuals' behaviours, opportunities, aspirations or relationships based on their gender, or that reinforce unequal power relations between genders (see also 'harmful and restrictive masculinities'). They can also be positive, when they promote equity, inclusion and shared power, for example, by encouraging people of all genders to pursue a full range of roles, express themselves freely, and share responsibilities (see also 'positive and inclusive masculinities'). The socialization process happening within educational institutions often replicates that of broader society and can contribute to the reproduction of social and gender norms (Marcus et al. 2024; UNICEF et al., 2019; Cookson et al., 2023; Stromquist, 2007). Gender parity in education is an indicator of the ratio of girls to boys, women to men. Gender parity is reached when there is equal representation and participation of male and female learners in education. It is a useful indicator, but by itself does not measure gender equality (UNESCO, 2022b). Gender-responsive means that strategies include evidence-based gender analysis which identifies and acknowledges existing gender differences, needs and inequalities. Activities at this level include specific policies and actions that address inequalities. Gender-responsive strategies, such as training in gender-responsive pedagogy, can be used as part of a system-wide, gender-transformative approach to education. Gender-responsive pedagogy is understood as teaching and learning processes that pay attention to the specific learning needs of learners of different genders. In practical terms, this means that the learning materials, methodologies, content, learning activities, language use, classroom interaction, assessment and classroom set up respond to specific needs of learners of different genders (UNESCO-IIEP, n.d.). Gender socialisation is the process through which individuals learn, internalize, and perform socially constructed gender norms, roles, and behaviours. This occurs through interactions with key agents of socialization, such as family, peers, the media, and social institutions. For example, boys learn and internalize how 'real men' should be through gender socialization (John et al., 2017).

Gender stereotypes are simplistic generalizations about the gender attributes, differences and roles of girls, women, boys and men and people of other genders (UN Women, 2025).

A gender-transformative approach entails addressing the underlying causes of gender inequalities. It includes implementing policies and initiatives which not only address the different needs, aspirations, capacities and contributions of girls, boys, women, men and non-binary people, but also challenge existing and discriminatory policies and practices, creating radical change. A gender-transformative approach to education is one that encompasses policy, programming and interventions to create opportunities to actively challenge gender norms and wider inequalities. This includes promoting gender equality through curricular and teaching reforms (UNESCO, 2022a).

Harmful and restrictive masculinities are linked to hegemonic gender norms which suggest that boys and men should conform to a 'right' or 'ideal' way to be a man or a boy (see 'hegemonic masculinity'). This 'ideal' places pressure on boys and men to conform to certain expectations, which often include being self-sufficient, acting tough and using aggression to solve conflict. It is constructed in opposition to femininities and/or marginalized masculinities. Such ideas and practices of masculinity are harmful to girls, women and non-binary people as they uphold men's privilege over women and non-binary people. They are also harmful to boys and men, who are regulated by rigid expectations of manhood that restrict their freedom to express emotions, seek help, or deviate from dominant masculine norms. Harmful and restrictive masculinities can undermine boys' motivation and learning, because they often position academic effort and aspiration as incompatible with being a 'real' boy or man, affecting boys' motivation to learn (Heilman et al., 2017; UNESCO, 2022a; UNESCO-IBE, 2025 WHO, 2019).

Hegemonic masculinity is the culturally dominant form of masculinity that is commonly upheld as the 'right' or 'ideal' way to be a man or a boy. In many contexts it positions men and boys as superior to women and girls and people of other gender identities, with negative consequences for people of all genders (Connell, 2005; Marcus et al., 2024).

Homophobia refers to fear, discomfort, intolerance or hatred of homosexuality or sexually diverse people (UNESCO, 2015).

Inclusive education is the process of strengthening the capacity of the education system to reach out to and include all students (UNESCO, 2022b).

Intersectionality refers to the way in which different aspects of a person's identity, such as gender, age, disability, ethnicity, geography, socioeconomic status, displacement and sexual orientation and gender identity and expression interact to shape their experiences and access to power, opportunities, and rights. It recognizes that people can face multiple, overlapping and compounding forms of discrimination and marginalization. Notions of masculinity interact with the above characteristics in complex and reinforcing ways (Crenshaw, 2017; Marcus et al., 2024; UNESCO, 2020; UN Women and UNPRPD, 2022).

LGBTIQ+ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer/questioning people, with the '+' symbol acknowledging those who identify as gender-diverse and who use additional terminologies. Lesbian refers to a woman who is emotionally, romantically, or

sexually attracted to other women. Gay refers to a person, often understood to be a man, who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to people of the same gender. Bisexual refers to a person who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to more than one gender. Transgender refers to a person whose gender identity and/or expression differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Intersex refers to a person born with physical sex characteristics (such as chromosomes, sexual anatomy, or reproductive organs) that do not fit typical definitions of male or female. Queer is often used as an umbrella term for sexual and gender diversity. Questioning refers to a person who is exploring or uncertain about their sexual orientation or gender identity (based on UNESCO, 2020; UNESCO, 2019b; UNESCO, 2016). Non-binary is an umbrella term that refers to a gender identity outside of the male-female gender binary. This can include people with a specific gender identity other than man or woman, people who identify as two or more genders, and people who do not identify with any gender (based on UNHCR, 2024). Positive and healthy masculinities emphasize the constructive aspects of masculine identities. They serve as a counterpoint to harmful and restrictive gender norms that portray men and boys as potential perpetrators or aggressors and focus solely on the harm they cause to themselves and others. It emphasises that all boys and men should be free to express diverse expressions of positive masculinities without fear of exclusion, ridicule or violence. Positive and healthy masculinities refer to alternative expressions of 'hegemonic masculinity' (see above) that align with egalitarian values and promote health and well-being. Examples include committed fatherhood and partnership, caring and intimacy, and help-seeking behaviour. The use of the plural term 'masculinities' underscores that there are many positive ways to be a boy or man. It also recognizes that masculine (and feminine) gender norms differ across cultures and contexts and change over time. Promoting positive and healthy masculinities is central in efforts to shift gender norms that harm boys and men and the people around them (based on UNESCO, 2014; UN Women, 2016). Sex: Refers to the biological characteristics that distinguish males, females and intersex individuals (UNESCO, 2022b). Sex characteristics are physical or biological features. Sexual orientation refers to a person's capacity for profound emotional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender, the same gender or more than one gender (UNESCO, 2019b; UNESCO, 2016). Social norms refer to rules, often informal and implicit, that guide how people are expected to behave in a group or society. People are often rewarded for conforming to these norms and punished for deviating from them (Marcus et al., 2024). considers the entire school ecosystem rather than its individual parts

A whole-school approach when working with students and teachers to achieve change, for example towards gender equality. Common elements of a whole-school approach are policies, teacher training, pedagogies, environments and engaging with parents and caregivers (Marcus et al., 2024; Plan International et al., 2021).

## Complementing Gender Equality Efforts in Education

The Lifting Barriers Global Resources on supporting boys' engagement in education is designed to complement, not compete with, existing efforts to promote girls' education and gender equality in schools. While significant progress has been made in addressing barriers to girls' education, this important work must continue. At the same time, many boys face challenges that impact their learning, well-being, and future opportunities. This guide should be seen as a complement to broader gender equality efforts, including those focused on girls' education. Teachers, parents, and school leaders can use them alongside existing strategies to ensure all students - regardless of gender - have the support they need to succeed.

Strengthening boys' engagement in education is not just about improving outcomes for boys; it also contributes to gender equality more broadly. When schools challenge harmful and restrictive masculine norms and foster more inclusive spaces, girls benefit from more equitable learning environments, free from harmful stereotypes and imbalances. Ensuring all children, regardless of gender, can fully participate in their education is essential for building a more just and equal society.

## Introduction to Working with Boys

## An overview of this guide

This guide is designed to support facilitators in creating and sustaining Boys' Clubs - safe, engaging spaces where boys can explore healthy and positive masculinity, build social-emotional skills, and contribute to gender equality and their own educational success. It provides structured activities, discussion prompts, and facilitation strategies that encourage boys to think critically about gender norms, relationships, and their role in fostering positive change. This guide can be implemented in after school clubs, or informally in community settings with youth between ages 9-12. For in school lesson plans, refer to the Teacher's Guide resource.

More than just a curriculum, this implementation guide takes a gender-transformative and asset-based approach to engaging boys. Rather than treating them as problems to be fixed, it recognizes their strengths, leadership potential, and capacity for growth 1 . It provides guidance for facilitators to nurture boys' existing sense of fairness, empathy, and responsibility, helping them develop skills that benefit both their personal development and their communities.

Equally important, this guide emphasizes the link between gender equality and educational engagement and attainment . Research shows that harmful and restrictive masculine norms can contribute to school

This idea is aligned with Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligence Theory. The theory encourages an approach to education that recognizes and nurtures diverse strengths in individuals, rather than focusing solely on traditional academic measures

of intelligence.

Five Main Resources to Address Boys' Disengagement from Education

disengagement, low academic performance, and dropout rates among boys. By addressing these norms and promoting positive identities, Boys' Clubs help foster an environment where boys feel supported in their learning, motivated to succeed academically, and encouraged to see education as a key part of their future.

Guidance

As facilitators read through this guide, they will find:

Guide

- A structured yet flexible curriculum that includes monthly themes, main activities, and supplementary activities to reinforce learning. These lessons are meant to be implemented outside of the school timetable as they are lengthier sessions.
- Facilitation strategies for creating inclusive spaces, guiding discussions, and supporting boys' personal and academic development.
- Recruitment and retention strategies to ensure long-term engagement.
- Adaptation guidelines to help tailor activities to different settings, needs, and cultural contexts.

By equipping boys with critical thinking skills, emotional intelligence, and a deeper understanding of gender dynamics, this guide aims to create lasting impact - not only in their own lives but also in their relationships, schools, and broader communities. Through consistent participation, boys will be empowered to navigate challenges, stay engaged in education, support and collaborate with  their peers, and contribute to a more just and equitable society.

This guide is part of a set of global resources developed under the Lifting Barriers Project supported by the Global Partnership for Education's Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE-KIX), a joint endeavor with the International Development Research Centre, Canada. These resources are for educators both inside and outside of formal education system and include:

- Educators' Guide: A resource to promote gender-transformative and inclusive pedagogy, equipping educators with strategies to create gender-equitable learning environments that support boys' growth and academic success, as well as gender equality.

- In-Classroom Modules for Educators: Lesson plans and activities that help teachers introduce gender equality topics in the classroom, enhancing students', with a particular focus on boys, awareness of societal gender inequalities and how these shape their lives and choices.
- Guide to Working with Parents and Caregivers to Support Boys' Education:: A guide for schools and key stakeholders to engage parents in discussions about the value of boys' education and how gender equality positively impacts their well-being.
- Guidance for Teaching and Learning Materials: This guide has been developed to support Ministries of Education and other stakeholders involved in the revision or development of teaching and learning materials with the aim of ensuring that these materials actively promote gender equality and inclusion.

Each resource is designed to complement the others, ensuring a holistic approach to fostering boys' engagement in education and gender equality.

This guide is designed for teachers, community and religious leaders, and NGO practitioners who work with boys aged 9 to 12 in upper primary education settings. Facilitators may also choose to adapt the lessons for slightly younger or older groups, depending on the needs and maturity of their learners. Whether you are an experienced facilitator or new to this work, this guide will help you navigate your role effectively.

## Why a focus on boys, specifically?

Boys' Clubs provide a critical space for boys to reflect on their identities and roles in their community, explore healthy relationships, and develop leadership skills in a supportive environment. While gender equality initiatives have traditionally focused on empowering girls - which remains essential - there is also a growing recognition that boys must be actively engaged in conversations about gender norms and equality. Without this engagement, harmful stereotypes and restrictive expectations of masculinity continue unchallenged, limiting boys' own well-being and reinforcing broader societal inequalities. Boys' Clubs create an opportunity to address these issues early, fostering positive social and emotional development that benefits not only boys themselves but also their families, schools, communities, and society.

Although this guide is designed with a focus on boys, there is flexibility for facilitators to adapt sessions for mixed-gender groups, including girls and non-binary youth. In some settings, it may be appropriate and effective to implement the activities with both boys and girls, encouraging mutual understanding and shared learning around healthy relationships, respect, and equality.

Research shows that harmful gender norms negatively impact boys' mental health, relationships, and educational outcomes 2 . Societal expectations that equate masculinity with dominance, emotional suppression, and risk-taking can contribute to increased rates of school disengagement, violence, and poor mental health among boys. By providing a safe, inclusive, and structured space for boys to challenge these norms, Boys' Clubs help them build empathy, develop emotional intelligence, and embrace more flexible, healthy expressions of masculinities. This, in turn, leads to stronger interpersonal relationships, greater school engagement, and improved overall well-being.

Boys' engagement in gender equality is not just beneficial for them - it is also essential for advancing broader social change. When boys grow up with equitable attitudes and behaviors, they become men who support fairness in the household, relationships, workplace, community, and society at large. Programs that involve

boys in discussions about gender equality have been shown to reduce gender-based violence, increase support for women's leadership, and promote healthier family dynamics. Boys' Clubs create an environment where boys can learn these values in an age-appropriate and interactive way, shaping the next generation of allies and advocates for gender justice.

Importantly, working with boys must go hand in hand with continued efforts to support girls' empowerment and education. This is not a zero-sum game - advancing gender equality requires a relational approach that addresses the experiences and needs of all children. Boys and girls are deeply interconnected in their families, schools, and communities, and the barriers they face are often reinforced by the same rigid gender norms. By engaging boys in conversations about fairness, respect, and healthy relationships, we not only improve their well-being but also create an environment where girls can thrive free from discrimination and violence. Gender equality is achieved not in isolation but through collective action, and investing in boys' engagement strengthens the foundation for a more just and inclusive future for all.

To this end, we encourage facilitators to use their judgment in determining whether a mixed-gender approach may be suitable for their group. Sessions can be adapted to reflect the experiences and needs of both boys and girls, promoting inclusive conversations and collective growth. The core principles of empathy, fairness, and healthy relationships remain relevant to all young people, and inclusive facilitation can strengthen the impact of these lessons across diverse learning environments.

## Forming and Facilitating Boys' Clubs

## Forming Boys' Clubs

Creating a Boys' Club is an opportunity to foster a supportive and inclusive space where boys can explore healthy and positive masculinities, develop leadership skills and future aspirations, and engage in meaningful discussions about gender equality. A well-structured club provides boys with the chance to build relationships, reflect on their identities, and challenge harmful gender norms in a safe and engaging environment. However, forming a Boys' Club requires careful planning to ensure its success and sustainability.

Clubs generally range in size from 10 to 25 boys. While there is some flexibility based on context, we recommend avoiding groups that are too small or too large, as the curriculum is built around active discussion, group work, and peer engagement. Smaller groups may limit diverse perspectives, while larger groups can make it harder for everyone to participate meaningfully.

The curriculum is designed for in-person sessions. However, facilitators may choose to adapt activities for virtual or hybrid formats depending on local needs, access, and resources. With thoughtful adjustments, the core goals of the club can still be achieved in a range of delivery models.

This section outlines key steps in establishing a club, from gaining stakeholder support to setting up a structure that encourages participation and long-term engagement. By following these guidelines, facilitators can create an inclusive, impactful space where boys feel empowered to grow, learn, and become advocates for gender equality.

- Step 1: Inform Key Stakeholders: Before starting your club, inform local education authorities, parents, and community leaders about its purpose and structure. Gaining their support is critical for success and sustainability. Organize information sessions and keep stakeholders updated on the club's progress to build trust and transparency.
- Step 2: Assess Existing Structures and Establish Facilitation: Before creating a new Boys' Club, evaluate whether similar clubs already exist in the school or community that promote related goals,

such as leadership, mentorship, or social-emotional development. In collaboration with key stakeholders, decide whether to integrate this curriculum into an existing group or establish a new, dedicated club.

Whichever approach is chosen, it is essential to ensure the club has a consistent and trusted adult facilitator - such as a teacher, school counselor, or community mentor - who can build strong relationships with the boys and guide discussions with care. If the facilitator is not directly affiliated with the school or organization, establish a clear linkage between them and the institution to ensure accountability, support, and continuity.

- Step 3: Recruit Club Members: Use announcements in schools, flyers, or community meetings to recruit members. For in school youth, leverage teachers and school staff to help you recruit; and for out of school youth, reach out to NGOs and community leaders.  Aim for diversity within the group to encourage different perspectives and create a richer learning experience. Ensure that the recruitment process is inclusive and avoids reinforcing stereotypes. Here are some tips to help you recruit:
- Make It Relatable and Relevant
- ■ Frame the club around topics that boys usually tend to care about, such as leadership, friendships, confidence, soft skills, or future success.
- ■ Use language that feels inviting rather than corrective - focus on empowerment, learning new skills, and relaxing and having fun.
- ■ Connect discussions on gender and equality to things boys care about, such as sports, music, or technology.
- Leverage Peer Influence
- ■ Encourage existing members to invite their friends - word of mouth is powerful.
- ■ Create a 'Bring a Friend' challenge where boys can introduce new members and receive small incentives.
- ■ Feature boys' voices in outreach materials (e.g., testimonials from members on how the club has helped them).
- Use Creative Outreach Methods
- ■ Hold an interactive launch event (e.g., a sports day, movie screening, or creative workshop) to generate interest.
- ■ Use social media, posters, and school announcements to spread the word.
- ■ Develop a simple, engaging flyer that highlights what the club offers and why it's worth joining.
- Step 4: Plan Logistics: Decide on the frequency, timing, and location of meetings. Schools are ideal venues due to their accessibility and connection to education. Assign a teacher or community member as the club advisor to provide additional support and guidance.

A well-planned and well-supported Boys' Club has the potential to create lasting change in the lives of its members and the broader community. By securing stakeholder buy-in, recruiting a diverse group of boys, and structuring meetings to be both engaging and reflective, facilitators can build a club that fosters personal growth, positive relationships, and a commitment to gender equality. The foundation laid during the formation process is critical to the club's long-term success, ensuring that boys remain engaged and invested.

## Preparing Yourself as a Facilitator

Before stepping into the role of a facilitator, it is essential to prepare not just the materials, but also yourself to create a space where boys feel comfortable, respected, and encouraged to engage. This preparation involves reviewing the materials, adapting them to your context, and choosing supplemental activities that

align with the needs and interests of the boys. It's also important to examine your own attitudes and beliefs as a facilitator to ensure that you create an inclusive and unbiased environment.

## Step 1: Review and Understand the Materials

Before facilitating a session, thoroughly review the materials provided. Understanding the content will allow you to guide the boys effectively through discussions, activities, and exercises. Take time to reflect on the core messages and learning outcomes for each session. Ensure that the materials reflect the goals of fostering healthy and positive masculinities and gender equality.

## Step 2: Adapt the Materials to Your Context

If any of the materials do not align with your community or cultural context, adapt them in a way that is respectful and relevant to the participants. For example, examples and stories can be localized to reflect the realities of the boys in your group. Adapting the material may also involve making it more engaging by using relevant language or incorporating community-specific examples. The key is to retain the core message while making it relatable. In addition to the core materials, decide which supplemental activities will best support the learning experience. Consider interactive exercises, videos, icebreakers, or group activities that will resonate with the boys and encourage participation. These activities should be designed to foster discussion, self-reflection, and personal growth, while being mindful of any sensitive topics or dynamics within the group. There is additional guidance on how best to conduct your adaptation on page XX of this document.

## Step 3: Reflect on Your own Biases

Understanding your own unconscious biases is crucial to facilitating a Boys' Club effectively. Unconscious biases are automatic, often unintentional judgments we make about people based on their gender, race, ethnicity, or other characteristics. These biases can influence how we interact with others, how we lead discussions, and how we respond to participants' contributions. As a facilitator, being aware of these biases allows you to create a more inclusive, welcoming, and nonjudgmental space for all boys.

We recognize that not all facilitators will come to this work with a deep background in gender, and that's okay. What's most important is a commitment to learning and self-reflection. Before diving into the club sessions, we encourage facilitators to first spend time learning about common gender norms and how they show up in boys' lives - such as the expectation to 'be tough,' avoid vulnerability, or prove dominance. These messages don't just affect boys; they also shape how adults perceive and interact with them.

To support this process, we recommend using Aly, Equimundo's AI facilitator coach. Aly can help you prepare for sessions, build confidence in discussing gender and power, and offer guidance on inclusive, youth-centered facilitation strategies. By investing in your own learning, you model for boys what it looks like to grow, reflect, and show up with openness - a powerful step toward transforming norms and creating space for all young people to thrive.

The following questions can help facilitators reflect on potential biases they may have regarding gender, masculinity, and their role in facilitating discussions.

- Gender Stereotyping
- Do I assume certain behaviors or interests based on a boy's gender? (e.g., thinking that boys should always enjoy sports or avoid expressing more vulnerable emotions)
- Am I unconsciously reinforcing traditional gender roles by assigning certain tasks or leadership roles based on a boy's gender? For example,  by asking 'calm girls' to sit next to 'energetic boys' to calm them down?
- Do I unintentionally reinforce the idea that boys should behave in specific 'masculine' ways, such as being strong, competitive or taking unnecessary risks?

- Emotional Expression
- Do I overlook or downplay boys who express emotions, especially if they do not conform to traditional masculine ideals?
- Am I more likely to encourage boys to talk about certain topics (like sports or ambition) and less likely to ask them about topics that challenge traditional masculinity (like vulnerability or personal struggles)?
- Do I ever unintentionally shame or dismiss a boy for expressing fear, sadness, or insecurity?
- Bias Towards Participation
- Do I tend to give more attention to certain boys based on their level of participation or how 'well' they fit societal expectations of masculinity?
- Do I inadvertently encourage more loud boys to speak up while neglecting quieter or more introverted participants?
- Am I giving equal attention to all participants, or do I unintentionally favor boys who share my views or background?
- Cultural Bias
- Do I make assumptions about boys based on their cultural background, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status?
- Am I interpreting boys' behaviors or attitudes through the lens of my own cultural norms, without considering their unique cultural context?
- Do I create space for boys from diverse cultural backgrounds to express themselves and share their perspectives?
- Disrespecting or Overlooking Diversity
- Do I unintentionally overlook the diverse identities and experiences of the boys in the group, such as those from different racial, religious, or gender expressions?
- Do I assume that all boys have similar experiences or that they all share the same perspectives on masculinity and gender equality?
- How can I create a space that honors the unique experiences of all boys, even if those experiences challenge the norms I am accustomed to?
- Favoring Certain Views
- Do I unintentionally reinforce my own values or views during discussions, without inviting boys to challenge or critically engage with the content?
- When boys express opinions that challenge my beliefs or the club's values, am I open to hearing their viewpoints, or do I dismiss them?
- Do I encourage boys to explore differing opinions and foster an environment where questioning and dialogue are welcomed?
- Assumptions About Roles
- Do I assume that a boy's behavior is a result of a lack of discipline or poor upbringing, rather than considering how societal expectations of masculinity influence their actions?
- Am I assuming a boy's leadership potential based on how well they conform to traditional masculine expectations, such as being assertive or competitive, rather than their character, empathy, or collaboration skills?
- Am I unintentionally guiding boys away from exploring qualities traditionally seen as 'feminine,' such as nurturing or cooperation?
- Encouraging Self-Expression
- Do I create an environment where all boys feel safe expressing their true selves, regardless of whether their identity fits traditional gender norms?
- Do I encourage boys to explore and express their vulnerabilities, or do I implicitly communicate that vulnerability is a weakness?
- Am I comfortable discussing subjects that may make boys feel uncomfortable, like emotions, empathy, and cooperation?

- Dealing with Bias in Others
- If/when another participant expresses a biased opinion or exhibits stereotypical behavior, do I address it, or do I ignore it to avoid conflict? We'd recommend you find ways to defuse the situation and ask others about what they think - always summarizing the discussion with the key take away message that aligns with the curriculum.
- Am I modeling inclusive behavior by calling out bias in the group and encouraging boys to do the same?

By reflecting on some of these questions, facilitators can better understand how their unconscious biases might influence their interactions with the boys and adjust their approach to ensure a fair and inclusive environment. Regular self-reflection and openness to feedback are key to minimizing bias and fostering a space where all boys can grow, learn, and engage meaningfully with the topics of masculinity and gender equality.

## Facilitating Boys' Clubs

Facilitating a Boys' Club is about more than just leading activities - it's about creating an environment where boys feel safe, valued, and motivated to grow. A strong facilitator guides discussions, encourages self-reflection, and fosters a culture of respect and inclusion. Boys' Clubs should not be spaces where boys are lectured about what they are doing wrong, but rather places where they are empowered to explore who they are, their strengths, what they care about, and how they can positively contribute to their families and communities, and their own wellbeing.

The Boys' Club sessions can be facilitated by individuals from diverse backgrounds, but it is important to consider how their gender, age, and seniority may shape boys' engagement and comfort levels in discussions. Facilitators need a strong understanding of the local community context to be able to relate with the participants. Gender can play a role in how boys perceive the facilitator's authority and openness - while male facilitators may be seen as relatable role models, female facilitators (or male/female co-facilitation teams) can challenge traditional gender norms and encourage boys to value different perspectives. Age also matters, as younger facilitators may be more approachable and relatable, whereas older facilitators may be viewed as authority figures, affecting boys' willingness to express themselves freely. Seniority within a school or community can influence how much respect and trust the facilitator commands - teachers, for example, may be seen as disciplinary figures, while youth mentors may create a more informal and open environment. The key is to select facilitators who can build trust, model healthy and positive masculinity, and encourage open dialogue, while ensuring that power dynamics do not discourage boys from participating fully.

This section provides practical guidance on how to effectively facilitate a Boys' Club, including creating an inclusive space, fostering meaningful discussions, and taking an asset-based approach to boys' engagement.

## Preparing for a Successful Session

Effective facilitation begins with careful preparation. Facilitators should have a strong understanding of the session content, plan their approach to activities, and anticipate any logistical or participant needs.

- Study the session: Review the session materials, facilitation methods, and timing in advance. Make notes, identify key discussion points, and plan for the use of energizers to maintain engagement.
- Reflect on the session: If co-facilitating, discuss the session beforehand, clarify any uncertainties, and even practice delivery if needed. Consider the following questions:
- What materials do I need for in-person or virtual delivery?
- Where is the best place to schedule breaks?
- How many participants are needed for the session to be effective?

- Are there any potential triggers for participants, and do I know the available youth-friendly support resources?
- Do I feel comfortable with all topics, or do I need to research certain concepts?
- How does the diversity of the club participants affect the way you'll discuss the topics? (economic backgrounds, dis/abilities, migrants, languages, cultures, religion, etc.)
- Gather materials in advance: Ensure all worksheets, supplies, and activity tools are ready before the session begins. If possible, provide or make arrangements for refreshments to help maintain energy and focus.
- Prepare the space: Arrange seating in a circle to encourage participation and inclusivity. Avoid a traditional classroom setup or, if using a classroom, rearrange it to create a more open and informal atmosphere, helping participants feel a break from the formalities of traditional learning settings.

## Creating a Safe and Inclusive Space

A Boys' Club should be a place where boys feel comfortable expressing themselves and engaging in honest conversations. To foster this, facilitators should:

- Set Group Agreements (Code of Conduct): Collaboratively establish expectations for respect, confidentiality, and active participation.
- Examples of Group Agreements:
- ■ Respect Everyone's Voice: We listen when others are speaking and don't interrupt, even if we disagree.
- ■ What's Shared Here, Stays Here: We respect confidentiality-personal stories don't leave the room unless someone is in danger or asks for help.
- ■ Speak from Your Own Experience: Use 'I' statements instead of generalizations (e.g., 'I feel … ' rather than 'Guys always … ').
- ■ Make Space, Take Space: If you usually talk a lot, make space for others. If you're quiet, challenge yourself to share.
- ■ Challenge Ideas, Not People: We can question harmful norms or beliefs without attacking the person who shared them.
- ■ Mistakes Are Part of Learning: We're all learning. It's okay to get things wrong-as long as we stay open to growth.
- ■ Phones Away, Focus Here: Let's stay present during our time together (unless needed for an activity).
- Encourage Open Dialogue: Use prompts such as, 'What do you think about … ?' to invite participation without pressure.
- Include Participants Meaningfully: Give boys small but active roles-like leading a game or summarizing a discussion-to boost engagement and ownership. Moving beyond top-down facilitation helps create a more collaborative and inclusive space.
- Be a Role Model: Demonstrate empathy, listening for intent, and respect in all interactions.
- Address Disruptions Constructively: Redirect behavior without shaming, focusing on reinforcing positive engagement.
- Use icebreakers and energizers: These short, interactive activities help boys feel comfortable, boost energy, and strengthen group cohesion. Some examples can be found in Annex 1 .
- Validate Lived Experiences: Acknowledge the unique experiences and challenges boys face while promoting discussion on how they can navigate them in positive ways.

## Taking an Asset-Based Approach to Boys' Engagement

Often, conversations about boys focus on what they are doing wrong - being disengaged from school, demonstrating aggressive behavior, resisting discussions about gender equality. This deficit-based approach views boys as problems to be fixed rather than as individuals with strengths, aspirations, and potential. An

asset-based approach shifts the focus to what boys bring to the table - their curiosity, leadership, sense of justice, and desire to belong - while recognizing and reinforcing the positive traits they already possess. Here are ways facilitators can implement an asset-based approach in Boys' Clubs:

## ● Affirm Boys' Positive Traits and Contributions

- Highlight when boys show kindness, leadership, vulnerability, or courage.
- Reinforce the idea that masculinity can include traits like empathy, cooperation, and care for others.
- Recognize small moments of growth and effort, not just big achievements.

## ● Build on Boys' Existing Interests and Strengths

- Use sports, music, storytelling, or hands-on projects to engage them in conversations about gender and identity.
- Connect discussions on equality to things they care about (e.g., fairness in sports, respect among friends).
- Encourage boys to take ownership of activities by allowing them to suggest topics or lead discussions.

## ● Reframe Gender Norms as Opportunities, Not Restrictions

- Instead of focusing solely on harmful and restrictive masculinity, explore what healthy and positive masculinity looks like.
- Ask questions like, 'What kind of man do you want to be?' rather than, 'Why are men like this?'
- Show examples of men who break stereotypes while thriving in different areas of life.

## ● Encourage Leadership and Agency

- Have boys mentor younger participants or lead parts of discussions.
- Give them opportunities to design solutions for issues in their communities.
- Celebrate when boys take initiative to challenge unfairness or speak up for others.
- If available, identify and may invite the trusted young male in the community to share their experiences of how they challenge gender norms in the family as well as stand up for improved gender equality. Bringing the testimonial to share.

## ● Foster a Sense of Belonging and Purpose

- Emphasize that the club is about giving them space to grow, not about 'fixing' them but about supporting their development, listening to their voices, and helping them build the tools to thrive as they define who they want to become.
- Frame participation as a strength, not a correction - boys are here because they can make a difference, not because they are a problem.
- Create rituals that reinforce belonging (e.g., opening and closing reflections, group handshakes, shared goals).

By taking an asset-based approach, Boys' Clubs become spaces where boys feel empowered rather than blamed, and where they can develop the confidence and skills not just to support others, but for their own well-being and growth. For additional principles and ways that you can take an asset-based approach, visit Ulster University's Taking Boys Seriously Principles.

## Facilitation Strategies for Meaningful Discussions

Facilitating meaningful discussions requires skill and intention. Boys need space to share, reflect, and challenge their own assumptions in a supportive and safe setting. To do this effectively:

- Ask Open-Ended Questions: Instead of 'Do you agree with this?' try 'How do you see this playing out in your daily life?'
- Use Real-Life Scenarios: Bring in stories, role-plays, and media examples that align with their cultural contexts to ground discussions in reality.
- Encourage Peer Learning &amp; Exchange: Let boys respond to each other's ideas before jumping in as the facilitator.

- Normalize Different Perspectives: Reinforce that it's valid to question and change one's opinion over time.
- Balance Discussion with Action: Pair conversations with hands-on activities that reinforce learning.

## Retention Strategies

Recruitment is about getting boys to join , but retention is about making them want to stay . Boys' Clubs thrive when members feel a strong sense of connection, purpose, and fun. By using relatable outreach strategies, fostering belonging, keeping activities engaging, and recognizing members' contributions, facilitators can build a Boys' Club that not only sustains participation but also creates lasting positive change in boys' lives and communities. Here are some tips to keep boys engaged:

## ● Foster a Sense of Belonging

- Create rituals that build connection, such as a welcome ceremony for new members or a closing reflection at each meeting.
- Give boys leadership roles within the club (e.g., session co-facilitators, event planners, peer mentors).
- Reinforce that the club is a space for them - where their voices, experiences, and contributions matter.

## ● Make Meetings Interactive and Fun

- Balance discussions with hands-on activities (e.g., role-plays, group challenges, creative projects).
- Incorporate games, storytelling, and multi-media elements to keep sessions engaging.
- Provide opportunities for field trips, guest speakers, or special events to break up routine sessions.

## ● Recognize and Celebrate Milestones

- Acknowledge boys' participation and growth - this could be through certificates, shout-outs, or small rewards.
- Celebrate birthdays, group achievements, or personal accomplishments within the club.
- Mark the end of each phase (e.g., every three months) with a community event, showcase, or outing.

## ● Adapt to Boys' Evolving Interests and Needs

- Regularly check in with members to see what's working and what they'd like to explore further.
- Stay flexible - if attendance drops, consider adjusting meeting formats, locations, or discussion topics.
- Create space for boys to co-design activities, ensuring they have a stake in shaping the club experience.
- Explore topics or current events  that are relevant or interesting to the community.
- Consider different identities and abilities and foster inclusiveness within the session's activities.

## ● Build Strong Relationships with Families and Communities

- Keep parents, caregivers, and local authorities informed about the club's activities so they continue to support their sons' participation. (you can visit the Parent Engagement Sessions for ideas)
- Encourage intergenerational engagement by hosting occasional family-friendly events, including local elders.
- Involve community role models who can reinforce the club's lessons and provide mentorship opportunities.

## Session Structure and Themes

## Session Structure

Each session lasts 1-1.5 hours and follows a structured flow: starting with a warm-up, transitioning into the main activity, and concluding with a reflection or key takeaway. Encourage boys to share their thoughts and experiences during the wrap-up to reinforce learning.

At the beginning of each session, you'll find a list of required materials, learning objectives, key takeaways, and facilitator notes to help you prepare in advance.

Additionally, each session includes optional supplementary activities that facilitators can use throughout the month to reinforce key themes. To maintain momentum and engagement, meeting once a week is recommended.

## Monthly Themes

The curriculum includes 12 themes, one for each month. Facilitators should consider the flexibility needed based on the academic calendar or scheduling constraints. Each month features a main structured activity, along with supplementary activities that can be implemented throughout the month. We recommend starting with the structured activity at the beginning of the month to set the stage and introduce the theme. If needed, facilitators may adapt the timeline by combining themes or adjusting the pacing to ensure all key topics are covered within the available timeframe.

| Monthly Theme                                | Main Activity                                                                                                                                                                                | Supplementary Activities                                                                                                        |

## Adaptation Guidance

Adapting a program - making intentional changes to better align with the needs, lived experiences, and cultural context of the audience - is essential for ensuring relevance and meaningful engagement. Thoughtful adaptations can enhance participation and impact while maintaining the integrity of the program's goals. This section provides criteria to maintain fidelity to the program's core components. Generally, changes, or adaptations, can fall into four main categories: implementation context and approach, content, pedagogy, and delivery method.

- Implementation context and approach: which includes the target population, location, and cultural context. For example, this curriculum is designed for 9-12-year-old boys and is globally relevant.

- Content: which includes the session topics in general, as well as the specific age-appropriate, intersectional, and inclusive information, language, and principles embedded into the curriculum activities. For example, this curriculum contains sessions related to gender equality, violence prevention, studying techniques, healthy relationships, and other topics that will encourage educational engagement and attainment among boys in primary school.
- Pedagogy: which includes the use of a variety of teaching styles. Prioritizing critical thinking and reflection, heavy participation, and engagement with the material. For example, in most of the skill building sessions, the facilitators scaffold the session by introducing the topic, demonstrating the skill, and then providing an opportunity for the youth participants to practice themselves.
- Delivery Method: which include group size, and the sequence, cadence, and timing of the sessions. For example, this curriculum was designed to be implemented in 12 months - one theme per month. Each month includes one main structured activity and suggestions for supplementary activities.

The following framework categorizes adaptations into three levels - Green Light, Yellow Light, and Red Light based on their impact on core components and program fidelity.

- Green Light Adaptations are changes that do not compromise the core components of the curriculum. These adaptations help tailor the program to the specific needs of participants while maintaining its effectiveness. Examples include:
- Contextualizing examples and language to better reflect participant demographics, while not compromising the core messages of the curriculum.
- Adjusting activities to accommodate technology limitations (e.g., replacing an online component with a printed version)
- Modifying facilitation techniques to include participants with diverse abilities 3,4
- Yellow Light Adaptations involve more significant changes that should be made with caution to ensure core content is still delivered, and facilitation style is maintained. Examples include:
- Reordering sessions or activities, which may impact how concepts build upon each other
- Shortening or modifying interactive activities, potentially reducing participant engagement and skill-building opportunities
- Changing group sizes or dynamics, which could affect participation and discussion depth
- Red Light Adaptations should be avoided, as they compromise or remove essential program components, potentially reducing its effectiveness. Examples include:
- Omitting key topics or lessons, leading to gaps in learning outcomes
- Removing interactive elements (e.g., discussions, role-plays) that are critical for participant engagement and behavior change
- Altering core messages in a way that weakens the program's intended impact

By using this framework, facilitators can make informed decisions about adaptations while preserving the themes, integrity, and effectiveness of the curriculum.

## Special Facilitator Guidance Note: Responding to Disclosures of Violence

When working with children ages 9-12, it's important to be prepared to respond to disclosures of violence sensitively and appropriately. Below are step-by-step guidelines to help facilitators navigate such situations effectively and responsibly.

## 1. Stay Calm and Supportive

3 https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000384009

4 https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000384599

- Why it matters: Children may feel scared or unsure about sharing their experiences. Your calm demeanor helps create a safe space for them to open up.
- How to respond:
- Keep your body language relaxed and your tone neutral.
- Avoid expressing shock, pity, anger, or judgment about what they share.

## 2. Listen Actively and Empathetically

- Why it matters: Children need to feel heard and validated.
- How to respond:
- Make eye contact and show you are listening.
- Use phrases like:
- ■ 'Thank you for telling me this.'
- ■ 'I'm here to help you.'
- ■ 'You're very brave for sharing this with me (or the group).'

## 3. Do Not Promise Confidentiality

- Why it matters: While you want the child to feel safe, certain disclosures (e.g., abuse or neglect) may need to be reported to protect the child.
- How to respond:
- Say: 'I may need to share this with someone who can help keep you safe, but I'll only tell people who need to know, like police, or school authorities.'
- Do not make promises like 'I won't tell anyone.'

## 4. Avoid Asking Leading or Investigative Questions

- Why it matters: Facilitators are not investigators; asking detailed questions may retraumatize the child or interfere with professional investigations.
- How to respond:
- Allow the child to share at their own pace.
- Use open-ended questions sparingly, such as:
- ■ 'Can you tell me more about that?'
- ■ 'How did that make you feel?'

## 5. Reassure the Child It's Not Their Fault

- Why it matters: Children often feel responsible for violence or harm they experience.
- How to respond:
- Say: 'This is not your fault.'
- Emphasize: 'You did nothing wrong.'

## 6. Take Immediate Action if the Child is in Danger

- Why it matters: Your priority is ensuring the child's safety.
- How to respond:
- If the child is in immediate danger, follow your organization's safeguarding procedures or contact local child protection services immediately, as applicable.
- Stay with the child until help arrives if they are in imminent danger.
- Consult with local authorities, as needed, if family is suspicious. This should be someone to whom you should be report in case there is abuse, violence.
- If possible and if you have the information, inform the child of what will happen now that the danger has been reported. Providing information on next steps can help; but it is context and situation specific, and phrasing carefully is important.

## 7. Follow Mandatory Reporting Laws

- Why it matters: Many countries have laws requiring the reporting of suspected abuse or violence.
- How to respond:
- Familiarize yourself with local laws and reporting protocols before the session.

- Report the disclosure to the appropriate authorities or designated child protection officer in your organization.

## 8. Provide Emotional Support After the Disclosure

- Why it matters: Disclosing violence can be a stressful and emotional experience for a child.
- How to respond:
- Offer comfort: 'You're safe right now, and we'll work together to make sure you get the help you need.'
- If appropriate, engage them in a calming activity to reduce anxiety, such as drawing or listening to music.
- If children are in need emotional support, you may need to work with family to give support them at home as well.

## 9. Document the Disclosure

- Why it matters: Clear documentation ensures that the child's account is accurately conveyed to authorities or support services.
- How to respond:
- Write down what the child said as soon as possible after the conversation.
- Use the child's exact words and avoid adding interpretations.
- Record the date, time, and any actions you took.

## 10. Seek Support for Yourself

- Why it matters: Facilitators may feel emotionally affected by disclosures of violence.
- How to respond:
- Debrief with a trusted colleague or supervisor, respecting confidentiality.
- Use available mental health or supervision resources to process your own feelings.

## Key Principles to Remember

- Do no harm: Your role is to support the child without causing additional distress.
- Empower the child: Reinforce that seeking help was the right thing to do.
- Act ethically: Prioritize the child's safety and well-being above all else.

By following these steps, facilitators can provide a safe and supportive environment for children while taking appropriate action to protect them.

## 1. Welcome and Introductions (10 minutes)

Step 1: Facilitator introduces themselves and the purpose of the Boys' Club in simple, positive language.

'The Boys' Club is a space where we'll talk about what it means to grow up, to be a friend, a student, and a good person. We'll learn new skills, play games, and share ideas together.'

Step 2: Go around the circle and have each participant share:

- Their name
- One thing they enjoy doing (e.g., a hobby, a favorite subject, a sport)

Encourage light energy - this is about comfort and connection, not performance.

## 2. Group Icebreaker: 'Common Ground' (10 minutes)

Have the group stand in a circle. Read short statements and have participants step forward if it applies to them. Examples:

- 'I like football.'
- 'I have a brother or sister.'
- 'I like helping people.'
- 'I've felt nervous starting something new.'

After a few rounds, debrief briefly:

'We all have things in common - and things that make us unique. In this club, both are important.'

## 3. Setting the Ground Rules (20 minutes)

Ask, 'What do we need to make sure this group feels safe and respectful for everyone?'

Step 1: Write boys' answers on the flip chart under 'Our Boys' Club Agreements.'

Encourage ideas such as:

- Respect everyone's ideas.
- No teasing or laughing at others.
- Listen when someone is speaking.
- What's shared here, stays here (confidentiality).
- You can always choose not to share.

Step 2: Introduce the key facilitator statements to reinforce:

Step 2: Invite volunteers to share one part of their shield.

Step 3: Post shields on the wall (optional) to display the group's strengths and goals.

## 5. Closing Reflection (5 minutes)

Step 1: Ask:

- 'What is one thing you're excited about for this club?'
- 'What is one rule that will help make this group a safe space?'

## Facilitator's Closing Statement:

'Today we got to know each other and created our club's agreements. This space belongs to all of us - a place to learn, laugh, and grow together. Remember: you never have to share if you don't want to, and

everything we talk about here stays in this group. Next time, we'll start exploring what it means to be ourselves and how we can support each other as friends.'

## MONTH 1: GENDER EQUALITY AND MANHOOD

Objective: Explore societal messages about gender roles and masculinities through the 'Man Box' framework and understand how they shape behaviors and expectations.

## Session 1: Breaking Out of the Box

This 1-hour activity encourages boys (ages 9-12) to reflect on their experiences, understand the risks of harmful gender norms, and build confidence in being their authentic selves. The activity uses an asset-based approach, focusing on the boys' potential and unique qualities while encouraging them to envision positive futures for themselves.

## Objectives:

1. Reflect on societal messages about being a boy and understand the risks of harmful gender norms.
2. Build confidence in breaking free from stereotypes and embracing individuality.

## Materials Needed:

- Flip chart paper or a whiteboard and markers (for drawing the 'Man Box' and writing participant responses).
- Post-it notes or index cards for participants to write down their ideas about gender messages and expectations.
- Pens or pencils for each participant.
- A timer or clock to manage the timing of each discussion section.

## Activity Structure:

## 1. Opening Icebreaker: 'What Makes You, You?' (10 minutes)

Step 1: Ask each participant to think about one thing that makes them proud of who they are (e.g., being kind, loving animals, or being good at solving problems). They can share this with the group or write it on a sticky note and place it on a board labeled 'Who We Are.'

## 2. Exploring the 'Man Box' (20 minutes)

Step 1: Ask, 'What are some of the messages boys hear when they are told to 'act like a man'?' Write their responses inside the box on the flip chart. Examples may include: 'Don't cry,' 'Be strong,' or 'Boys are better at sports.'

Step 2: Discuss where these messages come from:

- Who is the messenger? (Parents, teachers, friends, media?)
- Do these messages differ based on who delivers them?
- What happens when boys don't follow these messages?

Step 3: Ask, 'What are the advantages of following these messages? What are the disadvantages?' Write responses inside and outside the box.

## 3. Asset-Based Reflection: Building a Positive Vision (20 minutes)

Step 1: Ask:

- 'Can you think of people in your life who don't fit inside the box?'
- 'How do these people make you feel? Do you believe they are happier or more confident?'

Encourage a brief discussion on the benefits of embracing individuality and breaking free from restrictive norms.

Step 2: Hand out sticky notes and ask:

- 'What do you want to do or achieve in your life? What makes you excited about the future?'
- 'How can being yourself help you achieve your dreams?'

Participants write their answers and stick them on a board labeled 'What's Possible for Me?'

Step 3: Pose these questions:

- 'What messages about boys and school do you hear? Are boys expected to do well in school?'
- 'How do these messages impact boys in school?'
- 'What could happen if boys feel free to work hard and do their best in school?'

Encourage a short discussion and write their ideas under the heading 'Education Outside the Box.'

## 4. Closing Activity: 'New Messages for Boys' (10 minutes)

Step 1: Ask, 'If you could write new messages for boys that help them feel happy, strong, and confident, what would those messages be?' Examples might include:

- 'It's okay to ask for help.'
- 'You can be smart, strong, and kind.'
- 'Being yourself is the best way to succeed and be happy.'

Step 2: Write these on a flip chart labeled 'Messages for the Future.'

Step 3: Ask participants to share one thing they'll do to 'step out of the box' and embrace being themselves.

## Facilitator's Closing Statement:

'Today, we talked about the messages boys hear about being a man and how these can hold us back. But we also talked about the power of being yourself and believing in your dreams. Breaking out of the 'Man Box' can help you achieve your goals, stay true to yourself, and build a happier life. Let's keep this in mind as we keep meeting and discussing as a group!'

## Possible Supplemental Activities (Month 1)

As a reminder, supplementary activities are optional and designed to engage the club beyond one structured session. In order to reinforce the messaging, we recommend at least 1 or 2 supplemental sessions every month . All the activities listed here are connected to this month's theme, but feel free to adapt or choose activities from other months if they better suit your group's interests or context. These activities are meant to

inspire, so feel free to modify them as needed to better fit your group's needs. Additionally, not all supplemental activities will be available in the local context. Feel free to choose what fits best for you or create your own activity .

You can also invite external guests to participate in these activities, such as non-club member boys, girls from the community, teachers, or other relevant figures. As long as the boys are the decision-makers in choosing these activities, it can be a great opportunity for collaboration and community building.

## 1. Photovoice Project: Capturing Caring Masculinities

## Activity Description:

Equip boys with cameras or smartphones and encourage them to take photos of positive examples of masculinity in their community. Examples could include a father playing with his child or doing chores, a teacher encouraging students, or a man volunteering in the community. (note that consent should be asked of people being photographed)

## Follow-Up Discussion:

- Why did you take these pictures?
- How did you feel when observing what you took pictures of?
- What do these images show about the inside or outside of the ManBox from our previous activity?
- How do these examples inspire you to act in your own life?

## 2. Movie Screening and Discussion: Positive Masculinity in Media

## Activity Description:

Host a movie featuring a film with themes of healthy and positive masculinity. Examples might include characters who challenge stereotypes, express emotions, or support others.

(Tip: Provide a curated list of movies that model healthy and positive masculinity - check out resources like this blog for suggestions.)

## Follow-Up Discussion:

- What did the characters teach us about being a boy or man?
- How did they challenge harmful stereotypes?
- What lessons from the movie can we apply to our lives?

## 3. Art Exploration: Masculinity Through Creative Expression

## Activity Description:

Visit a local art exhibit or host a gallery walk of artwork that explores themes of manhood and gender equality. For example, Utrecht's 'Mobilising Men for Feminist Peace' exhibit highlights love and nonviolence in masculinities (see details here).

## Follow-Up Discussion:

- What messages about manhood did the art convey?
- How did these pieces challenge or reinforce ideas about gender?
- What forms of art could you create to show your own ideas of manhood?

## 4. Personal Storytelling Circle: Heroes in Everyday Life

## Activity Description:

Create a storytelling circle where boys share examples of men they admire from their own lives - such as family members, teachers, or community leaders. Encourage participants to think about positive qualities that make someone a good role model.

## Follow-Up Discussion:

Not all admired figures promote healthy, positive behaviors. If participants mention public figures - such as

athletes or celebrities - encourage a critical discussion:

- What makes this person admirable? Is it their actions, values, or how they treat others?
- Do they challenge or reinforce harmful stereotypes? Do they promote respect, kindness, and fairness, or do they encourage aggression, dominance, or exclusion?
- What can we learn from their example? If they have both positive and negative traits, how can we choose which aspects to follow?

Encourage participants to reflect on role models beyond fame or strength, focusing on qualities like kindness, fairness, and standing up for others.

## 5. Music Workshop: Messages About Masculinity in Songs

## Activity Description:

Play a mix of songs that have messages about manhood - both reinforcing and challenging harmful norms. Ask boys to analyze the lyrics and discuss how music shapes their understanding of masculinity. Be mindful of the age and developmental level of participants. Younger boys (e.g., 9-year-olds) may need more guided discussion and simpler questions to help them connect the lyrics to their own experiences. Older boys (e.g., 12-year-olds) may be able to engage in deeper analysis and critical thinking. Adjust the complexity of the discussion based on the group's understanding, ensuring the activity remains engaging and accessible for all.

## Follow-Up Questions:

- What messages about being a man are in these songs?
- How do they make you feel about yourself?
- If you wrote a song about being a boy or man, what would the message be?

## 6. 'Superpower Cards' Workshop

## Activity Description:

Give boys blank index cards and ask them to create 'superpower cards' that represent the qualities they admire in themselves or others. Examples might include empathy, kindness, strength, or creativity.

## Follow-Up Discussion:

- Why did you choose these qualities?
- How can you use these 'superpowers' to help others and yourself?
- What other qualities can be celebrated?

## 7. Community Interviews: Masculinity and Role Models

## Activity Description:

In this activity, boys will conduct short interviews with men in their community - such as fathers, uncles, neighbors, teachers, or local shopkeepers - to learn about their experiences of masculinity, responsibility, and growth. The goal is to help boys reflect on the diversity of male experiences and to identify positive, healthy role models while also thinking critically about the messages they hear.

To avoid reinforcing bias or exclusion, facilitators should emphasize respect, inclusion, and critical reflection throughout the process. Boys should understand that there is no single way to 'be a man,' and that people's views may differ based on their background, generation, or life experience.

Consider vetting interviewees (when possible) to ensure they model respectful and nonviolent attitudes and align with the club's values of equality, care, and respect.

Offer a list of suggested questions, such as:

- What does being a man mean to you?
- How have you tried to be a 'good man' in your life?
- What advice would you give to boys about growing up?

- How has education allowed you to succeed in life?

## Follow-Up Activity:

After the interviews, facilitate a reflection discussion, encouraging boys to think critically about the responses and how different experiences shape ideas of masculinity.Have participants share findings with the group and create a fun activity (art showcase, video montage, theater play, etc.) based on their interviews.

## 8. Book Club: Exploring Healthy and Positive Masculinity Through Stories

## Activity Description:

Start a book club where boys read and discuss books that depict healthy and positive masculinity. Choose age-appropriate books from the Global Boyhood Initiative's recommended list or Room to Read's library, such as stories with male characters who demonstrate kindness, emotional expression, and respect for others. Room to Read as books in various languages, but you should also do some research in your local language for culturally appropriate books. You can be flexible about each boy reading something they want to read, or everyone reading the same book. If there is a library in the school or community, consider partnering with the librarian for a tour.

## Implementation:

- Select one book to start with and set a manageable reading schedule (e.g., one chapter per week).
- During each meeting, provide guided discussion questions, or encourage participants to share their thoughts.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What qualities did the characters show that we can admire?
- How did they respond to challenges in ways that felt true to themselves?
- What lessons from the book can help us in our own lives, especially at school or with friends?

## Bonus Activity:

Have the boys create their own short stories inspired by the themes from the books, imagining themselves as heroes who model healthy and positive masculinity.

## MONTH 2: VALUE OF EDUCATION AND GOAL SETTING

Objective: Identify barriers to education, brainstorm solutions, and develop short- and long-term goals for personal growth.

## Session 2: The Bridge to Your Future

This 1-hour session encourages boys (ages 9-12) to explore the value of education and the role it plays in achieving their goals and dreams. Through the engaging 'Building a Bridge to Education' activity, participants reflect on the obstacles they may face in staying in school and brainstorm solutions to overcome them. Using a strengths-based approach, the session empowers boys to identify resources, strategies, and personal goals that will help them build their own bridges to success.

## Objectives:

1. Understand the importance of education in achieving future goals.
2. Identify obstacles to staying in school and brainstorm solutions to overcome them (as applicable).
3. Develop concrete strategies for setting and achieving personal and educational goals.

## Key Takeaways for Boys:

1. Education is a powerful tool for achieving your dreams and creating a better future.
2. Challenges in education can be overcome by identifying resources, seeking support, and staying focused on your goals.
3. You have the power to help yourself and others by building 'bridges' to overcome obstacles together.

## Materials Needed:

- Flip chart paper or whiteboard and markers for drawing the image of the boy, the ditch, and the school, and for writing participant responses.
- Sticky notes or index cards for participants to write obstacles and solutions for the bridge.
- Pre-prepared goal-setting cards or handouts for participants to write their personal education goals.
- Pens or pencils for each participant.
- Timer or clock to keep the activity on track.

## Activity Structure:

## 1. Introduction: Why Education Matters (10 minutes)

Step 1: Begin by asking the boys to think about their dreams for the future:

- 'Who do you want to be when you grow up? Why is education important for achieving your dreams?'
- Write their answers on a flip chart or whiteboard to create a 'dream wall.'

Step 2: Pose the following question:

- Can you think of people in your life or community who have benefited from education?
- Think about those people you mentioned. How do you think they were able to attend school or get the education they needed? What support might they have had, or what challenges did they overcome to get there? Are they similar or different to the challenges you all face?

## 2. Activity: Building a Bridge to Education (20 minutes)

Step 1: Prepare or draw an image on a large poster or board. The image should show:

- A boy standing on one side of a ditch.
- A completed school on the other side.
- A large, empty space for a bridge in the middle.

Step 2: Show the image to the group and explain the scenario:

'This boy wants to complete school, but there is a big ditch stopping him. What kinds of things might make it hard for him to get to school (or do well in school)?'

Step 3: Ask participants to brainstorm challenges the boy might face. Examples might include:

- Lack of money for school supplies or school fees.
- Bullying or teasing at school.
- Feeling unmotivated or not understanding lessons.
- Household chores or family responsibilities.
- Lack of learning environment at home due to fights or violence
- Parents and communities do not view education as something to be proud of or a path to success.
- Parents send boys to work to contribute financially to the family.
- Schools are located far from the villages.
- No transportation from home to school and vice versa
- A learning disability

Write these obstacles inside the ditch.

Step 4: Next, ask the boys to brainstorm ways to build a 'bridge' to help the boy cross the ditch. (Facilitator note: It will be important to concentrate on those that are within their/your control. We recognize that not all of the obstacles they mentioned can be solved through this club.)

Examples might include:

- Encouragement and support from friends or family, community
- Asking for help from a teacher.
- Staying focused on long-term goals.
- Joining a study group, after-school program, or learning with your peers.

Step 5: Write their solutions as 'bridge planks' connecting the boy to the school.

## 3. Discussion: Overcoming Obstacles and Setting Goals (10 minutes)

Step 1: Facilitate a group discussion using the bridge as a metaphor for their own lives. Encourage participants to think about their own 'ditch' and 'bridge.'

Step 2: Pose these questions:

- 'What are some obstacles you face in your own education?'
- 'What are the planks in your bridge that will help you succeed in school?'
- 'Who can help/support you to build your bridge?'

## 4. Personal Goal Setting (10 minutes)

Step 1: Give the boys the Goal Setting handout and go over (read with the boys) the handout so they understand what to do.

Step 2: Tell boys to think of 1 short-term goal for school - something they want to achieve in school by the end of the school year.

Step 3: As they work individually, go around and help the boys think of a goal if they are having a hard time.

Step 4: After 2-3 minutes, ask them to come up with 3 smaller steps to reaching that school-related goal. For example, if the goal is to pass Reading Class with good marks, 3 smaller steps could be:  1) Make sure to read at least 20 minutes per day; 2) Ask the teacher when you need help in class; and 3) Read out loud to your family member (sibling, parent, etc.), or friend so they can hear how you are doing and give advice.

Step 5: After 5 minutes more, give the boys 1 minute to share their goal with the person sitting next to them.

Step 6: After 1 minute of sharing in pairs, ask 1-2 volunteers to share their goals with the larger group. If time allows, please give everyone an opportunity to speak.

## 5. Closing Reflections (10 minutes)

Step 1: Ask participants:

- What did you learn today about goal setting and education?
- What do you hope to do differently after today's session?

## Possible Supplemental Activities (Month 2)

As a reminder, supplementary activities are optional, additional activities that the club can engage in beyond the structured sessions. All the activities listed here are connected to this month's theme, but feel free to adapt or choose activities from other months if they better suit your group's interests or context. These activities are meant to inspire, so feel free to modify them as needed to better fit your group's needs. You can also invite external guests to participate in these activities, such as non-club member boys, girls from the community, teachers, or other relevant figures. As long as the boys are the decision-makers in choosing these activities, it can be a great opportunity for collaboration and community building.

## 1. Role Model Talk: The Value of Education

## Activity Description:

Invite an older youth or young adult (~18-30 years old) from the community to speak to the boys about the importance of education. Although this speaker could be any gender, a male speaker might resonate more with the young boys. The speaker can share their personal story of how staying in school helped them overcome challenges and achieve their goals, or, alternatively, how not staying in school affected their life. You could also invite someone who had a second chance at education to discuss the consequences they faced early on and how returning to school helped them succeed. Hearing about both the negative impacts of not staying in school and the success that comes from completing an education can provide valuable lessons and inspire the boys.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What part of the speaker's story inspired you the most? Why?
- What challenges do you think you might face in your education, and how can you overcome them?
- What are some goals you have for your own future, and how can education help you achieve them?

## 2. Team Hike: Reaching the Summit Together

Activity Description:

Organize a group walk or hike with the boys to a local hill, park, or nature area. Frame the activity around the metaphor of climbing a mountain as a symbol of working toward your goals. Highlight the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and supporting each other during the hike to 'reach the summit' together.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What challenges did you face during the hike, and how did you overcome them?
- How is reaching the summit similar to achieving your goals in school or life?
- How can working together help you succeed in both the hike and your education?

## 3. Field Trip to Higher Education

## Activity Description:

Take the boys on a field trip to a local university, high school, or vocational training center. Arrange for them to meet students or teachers who can share insights about what school life is like and what exciting opportunities they can look forward to. Alternatively, invite older students or teachers to visit and speak with the boys.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What was the most exciting or interesting thing you learned during the visit?
- What are you most looking forward to as you continue in your education?
- What steps can you take now to prepare yourself for the next stage of education?

## 4. Bridge-Building Competition

## Activity Description:

Divide the boys into small teams and provide materials such as popsicle sticks, glue, and string. Challenge them to build a bridge that can hold the most weight. Once completed, test each team's bridge and discuss how teamwork and problem-solving helped them succeed. Relate the activity to building 'bridges' to overcome challenges in education and life.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What challenges did your team face while building your bridge, and how did you solve them?
- How does building a strong bridge relate to building your future?
- What resources or support do you need to build your own 'bridge' to achieve your goals?
- How can you seek help from your friends or provide help to your friends to enhance learning achievement?

## 5. Vision Board Workshop: Dreaming Big

## Activity Description:

Provide the boys with a variety of magazines, newspapers, markers, scissors, and glue. Ask them to create vision boards that represent their dreams and goals for the future. Encourage them to think about what careers, hobbies, or achievements they want to pursue and how education can help them get there.

Afterward, allow them to share their boards with the group.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What is one goal on your vision board that you are excited about, and why?
- How can education help you achieve the things you included on your vision board?
- What steps can you start taking now to work toward your dreams?

## 6. Mentor Match-Up: Learning from Leaders

## Activity Description:

Organize a mentoring day where boys can meet and interact with local professionals, tradespeople, or community leaders. These mentors can share their career paths, the role education played in their success, and tips for staying motivated in school. Pair each boy with a mentor for a short one-on-one conversation. Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What was something inspiring or surprising you learned from your mentor?
- What kinds of skills or lessons have you learned from your mentor that will help you achieve your own goals?
- How do you think having a mentor can help you in the future? Do you think you could be a mentor for someone  younger than yourselves?

## 7. My Future Self Letter: Writing to Inspire

## Activity Description:

Ask the boys to write a letter (in whichever language they are most comfortable) or draw a picture to their future selves, imagining where they will be in 10 years. Encourage them to include the goals they hope to achieve, how they will overcome challenges, and the role education will play in their journey. Collect the letters and give them back to the boys a year later as a reflection exercise.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What was the most exciting thing you included in your letter?
- How do you think your education today can help you become the person you wrote about?
- What challenges might you face along the way, and how can you prepare to overcome them?

## MONTH 3: EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION

Objective: Build active listening and empathy skills through interactive and reflective exercises.

## Session 3: The Power of Words

This 1-hour session explores the importance of communication through fun and interactive activities that emphasize teamwork, active listening, and non-verbal cues. Using a gender-transformative lens, the activities encourage boys to value empathy, clear expression, and collaboration as tools to build stronger relationships in school, at home, and in their communities. Through hands-on tasks like building towers and describing images, boys learn how communication can help resolve conflicts, strengthen teamwork, and make learning more enjoyable.

## Objectives:

1. Understand the importance of clear communication and active listening.
2. Develop skills to communicate effectively with peers, teachers, and family members.
3. Recognize how effective communication builds stronger relationships and supports success in school.

**Facilitator Note: Not all children interpret or express non-verbal cues - such as tone of voice, body language, or facial expressions - in the same way. Some may find it difficult to read or use these social signals, especially those who are on the autism spectrum or have other communication differences.

## As a facilitator, it's important to:

- Avoid assumptions about what participants 'should' understand or express.
- Explain non-verbal communication clearly , using concrete examples (e.g., 'When someone folds their arms, they might be feeling upset or cold. It can mean different things.').
- Normalize different ways of communicating - remind boys that everyone has their own style, and that listening with patience and kindness matters most.
- Encourage multiple ways to participate (e.g., writing or drawing responses instead of speaking, if that feels more comfortable).
- Promote peer empathy and inclusion by discussing how people can support friends who communicate differently.

If facilitators know or suspect that a participant is on the autism spectrum or has communication challenges, they may wish to consult with the school counselor or teacher for guidance on how best to support that child.

This approach ensures that the session builds awareness of communication diversity - and reinforces the Boys' Club's core values of respect, empathy, and belonging for all.

## Key Takeaways for Boys

1. Communication is more than words - it includes listening carefully, expressing yourself clearly, and noticing your and others' non-verbal cues.
2. Teamwork improves when everyone listens and works together toward a shared goal.
3. Good communication helps build stronger relationships and makes problem-solving easier at school and home.

## Materials Needed:

- Flip chart or whiteboard to write down discussion points and takeaways.
- Markers or pens for recording ideas and drawing exercises.
- Paper cups, popsicle sticks, straws, tape , or blocks for building the towers
- Timer or clock to track building time.
- Blank sheets of paper (1 per pair).
- Simple picture prompts (e.g., printed or drawn examples like a tree, house, or sun).

## Activity  Structure

## 1. Opening Discussion (10 minutes)

Step 1: Begin by asking:

- 'What does communication mean to you?'
- 'What makes it hard to communicate with others sometimes?'

Step 2: Explain that communication isn't just about talking, but also about listening, understanding others, and paying attention to non-verbal cues like body language and facial expressions.

## 2. Team Drawing Challenge (15 minutes)

Step 1: Split the boys into pairs and give each pair a blank sheet of paper and two markers of different colors.

Step 2: Announce that one boy is the 'speaker,' and the other is the 'drawer.' The 'speaker' describes a simple picture (e.g., a house, a tree, or a smiling face) while the 'drawer' draws it based solely on the spoken instructions. The speaker cannot see the drawing, and the drawer cannot ask questions.

Step 3: For 2 minutes, let the pairs draw the object following these directions.

Step 4: After a few minutes, switch roles with a new drawing prompt.

Step 5: At the end, compare the drawings with the original prompts and discuss the outcomes using the following questions.

- What was that experience like? Can you tell me how it went?
- How closely the drawing is to the verbal description?
- What were challenges each side faced during this "communication" process?
- How did you work together to improve your communication? Remember communication isn't always verbal.
- How can this activity help you communicate better in school or at home?

*Facilitator note : Some learners may say they're 'not good at drawing' and feel hesitant to participate. Remind them that the goal of this activity isn't about artistic ability - it's about communication. Everyone has different strengths, and for some, expressing ideas through drawing is one of them. Encourage participants to focus on what their picture communicates , not how it looks. The important part is sharing ideas and understanding each other.

## 3: Build a Tower Together (25 minutes)

Step 1: Split the boys into small groups (3-4 per group).

Step 2: Give each group the same materials to build a tower (e.g., paper cups, popsicle sticks, or blocks).

Step 3: Assign one boy in each group to be the 'builder' and the others as 'advisors.' Only the builder can touch the materials, but the advisors must guide them on how to build the tower using words.

Step 4: After 5-7 minutes, switch roles so someone else becomes the builder. Continue until all group members have a turn.

Step 5: At the end, look at the towers and discuss how communication affected the outcome. Instead of only focusing on giving attention to the 'tallest' or 'sturdiest' tower, you should also create several superlative categories like 'most creative', 'most beautiful', etc.

Step 6: Ask the follow-up discussion questions :

- 'What challenges did you face when explaining or listening?'
- 'How did your team improve communication as the activity went on? Or how could it be improved?'
- 'What can you take from this activity to improve teamwork in real life?'

## 4. Closing Reflection and Group Discussion (10 minutes)

Step 1: Ask the boys:

- 'What is one thing you learned today about communication?'
- 'Why is listening as important as speaking?'
- 'How can you use what you learned today at school or at home?'

Step 2: Encourage them to practice active listening throughout the week and share what they notice in their relationships.

This 1-hour session helps boys aged 9-12 understand the changes their bodies and minds go through during puberty and equips them with strategies to manage these changes while staying focused on their education. Through relatable scenarios, interactive activities, and open discussions, boys learn about the physical, emotional, and social aspects of puberty. The session also encourages empathy and understanding about what girls experience during puberty, fostering a supportive environment in school and their communities. By connecting these lessons to the importance of education, the session emphasizes how managing puberty effectively can help boys remain engaged in their studies and achieve their goals.

## Session Objectives:

1. Understand the physical, emotional, and social changes that occur during puberty, including wet dreams, erections, female sexual excitement, and menstruation.
2. Learn strategies to handle these changes and stay focused on educational goals.
3. Encourage open discussion to normalize puberty and reduce stigma.

## Key Takeaways:

1. Puberty is a natural process that everyone experiences, and it's important to understand and manage its changes confidently.
2. Developing communication and coping skills can help boys handle emotions, peer pressure, and challenges during puberty.
3. Supporting peers and creating a respectful environment, including being understanding of menstruation, strengthens friendships and school engagement.

## Materials Needed

- Flipchart paper or a whiteboard and markers for group discussions
- Handouts with changes to the male and female bodies
- Scenario cards f or the interactive activity ('Managing Puberty and Staying Focused').
- Post-it notes or small pieces of paper for participants to write anonymous questions .
- A timer or clock to manage session timing.

**Facilitator Tip: Puberty - and the physical and mental changes that accompany it - can be a very sensitive topic. You might not be used to talking about these topics openly. Practice this session a couple of times either with colleagues or by yourself before doing it with your group members. If you feel comfortable and are able to normalize these changes, then they will feel comfortable as well. You as the facilitator are not expected to be an expert on puberty. Say 'I don't know' rather than come up with an answer that could be wrong. If possible, try to have information on where participants can get answers to their questions, such as at a health clinic. However, check that these places are friendly to young people. Some healthcare providers may discourage young people from seeking such information. If you feel uncomfortable talking about this topic with youth, feel free to invite an expert on the topic to faciltiate.

## 1. Welcome Activity (5 Minutes)

Step 1: Give each participant a card or Post-it and ask them to write or draw something they think about when they hear the word 'growing up.'

Step 2: Collect responses and share a few aloud, emphasizing that everyone grows at their own pace, and puberty is a normal part of life.

Step 3: Say 'Today, we'll talk about what happens during puberty and how we can handle these changes while staying focused on our goals in school and life.'

## 2. Changes During Puberty (25 Minutes)

Step 1: Create two columns on a flip chart or whiteboard: Physical Changes and Emotional/Social Changes.

Step 2: Facilitate a brainstorm where boys can share what they know about changes during puberty (e.g., voice changes, growth spurts, acne, mood swings).

Add to the list with key points:

- Physical: Body hair, growth spurts, deeper voice, development of sweat glands, changes in weight, menstruation, wet dreams and erections.
- Emotional/Social: Mood swings, feeling self-conscious, attraction to others, peer pressure.
- Link to education: Highlight how these changes might make school feel different (e.g., embarrassment, distractions, difficulty focusing) but emphasize that this is normal and manageable.

Step 3: Ask 'How can we stay focused on our studies even when these changes feel overwhelming?'

Step 4: Pass out the 'Changes in My Body' handout to all participants (located after this activity) . Read out loud the general changes happening in the body using the handout. And ask if they relate to it and have any questions so far.

## 3. Managing Puberty and Staying Focused (25 Minutes)

Step 1: Divide participants into small groups. Provide each group with one of the scenarios on the handout (located after the session) .

Step 2: Allow 10 minutes for each group to read their scenario, discuss the accompanying questions, and brainstorm solutions or strategies to manage the situation. Encourage open sharing and respectful listening.

Step 3: Have each group present their scenario and insights to the larger group. Facilitators guide the discussion, clarifying and adding key points as needed.

Step 4: Facilitate a discussion to emphasize the connection between puberty and staying engaged in education:

- Preparedness: Understanding physical changes, carrying necessary items (e.g., deodorant, extra clothes), and knowing what's normal can reduce anxiety and distractions.
- Peer Support: Recognize peer pressure as a challenge during puberty (e.g., teasing, bullying) and discuss how boys can support one another rather than perpetuating harmful behaviors.
- Cultural Expectations: In some cultures, puberty marks the transition to manhood through coming-of-age rituals. Discuss the importance of balancing these cultural milestones with continued education.

- The Pull of Work: As boys grow older, they may feel pressure to leave school and start working to support their families. Discuss strategies to balance responsibilities and prioritize education for long-term benefits.

*Facilitator tip: Particularly for the conversations around child labor, please be sure not to add judgment or blame on parents. It'd be helpful to refresh yourself with national laws and international conventions regarding child labor to be able to assist in these types of situations.

## 5. Closing Activity (5 Minutes)

Step 1: Pass around a talking object (e.g., a small ball). Each participant shares one thing they learned or found helpful from the session.

Step 2: End with encouragement: 'Puberty is a normal part of growing up. Remember, it's okay to ask questions, talk to someone you trust, and focus on your goals as you navigate these changes.'

The activity also provides practical strategies to deal with peer pressure, empowering boys to make positive choices that protect their education and well-being.

## Objectives:

1. Help boys understand the risks of drugs and alcohol, explore the powerful influence of peer pressure
2. Learn how their choices impact their education, future success, and overall well-being.

*Facilitator Tip: Drugs, alcohol and addiction can be a sensitive topic. As a facilitator, it will be good to look out for and adjust your prompts if club members' parents/caregivers are struggling with an addiction. In your framing of this issue, it's important to stress that addiction is hard to fight and there shouldn't be blame.

## Key Takeaways for Boys:

1. Peer pressure can be strong, but you have the power to make choices that protect your education and future, even when facing the urge to use drugs or alcohol to feel more grown-up or escape difficult realities.
2. Drugs and alcohol may seem appealing, but they can have serious negative effects on your ability to succeed in school and reach your goals.
3. Resisting peer pressure and making good choices today will help you stay on track to achieve your dreams tomorrow.

## Materials Needed:

- Flip chart paper or whiteboard and markers (for brainstorming strategies and writing key messages).
- Printed case studies for small group discussions.
- Index cards or small pieces of paper for the reflection activity.
- Pens or pencils for participants.
- Timer or clock to manage session timing.

## Activity Structure:

## 1. Icebreaker: Future Aspirations and Peer Pressure (10 Minutes)

Step 1: Ask participants to imagine their future selves and think about their dreams. Where do they see themselves in 5-10 years in terms of an occupation? What job or accomplishment would make them proud? Step 2: Then ask:

- What if something or someone tried to take that away from you?

- Can you think of anything that could get in the way of reaching your goals?

Step 3: Introduce the concept of peer pressure by noting that external influences, like drugs or alcohol, can sometimes interfere with their future goals.

*Facilitator tip: As you're introducing drugs and alcohol, it's important to talk about what attracts young people to bad behaviors (like drugs and alcohol) from adolescent developmental changes perspective; such as strong need for being accepted by peers, risk taking tendency, harmful masculinity together with peer pressure - which collectively put young adolescents at risk to drinking alcohol and doing drugs. It would be useful for them to understand these characteristics and build their skill to say no again peer pressure.

## 2. Group Discussion: What Are Drugs, Alcohol, and Peer Pressure? (10 Minutes)

## Step 1: Ask:

- What do you know about drugs and alcohol?
- Why do you think some people use them, even when they know they can be harmful?
- What is peer pressure, and how does it play a role in these situations?

Step 2: Highlight that drugs and alcohol can affect their thinking, focus, and behavior, leading to poor decisions, failing grades, and potentially long-term consequences for their education and life.

## 3. Case Studies: The Impact of Peer Pressure and Drugs on Education (20 Minutes)

Step 1 : Divide the group into small teams and give each group a short case study. Ask each group to read and discuss the case and answer specific questions. Afterward, have each group present their answers to the larger group.

## Case Studies:

Case 1: A boy named Omar feels pressure from his friends to skip school and drink alcohol. He tries it, and afterward, he has trouble staying awake in class and struggles to complete his homework.

1. How did Omar's choice affect his education and schoolwork?
2. How could Omar have resisted the pressure from his friends?
3. What long-term effects could this decision have on Omar's dreams and future?

Case 2: A boy named Caleb is pressured by older kids to try smoking marijuana. At first, it seems fun, but after a few months, he starts missing school to hang out with them. His grades drop, and he loses interest in his studies.

1. How did Caleb's use of drugs affect his education and his goals?
2. What could Caleb have done to avoid the negative consequences of peer pressure?
3. How can poor choices like these create roadblocks to achieving dreams?

Case 3: A boy's friends suggest he try smoking before an exam to 'calm down' and feel less nervous. They say it's the secret to doing well on the test because it will help him relax. The boy isn't sure, but he feels pressure to do what they suggest.

1. How do drugs (including smoking) impact your brain and your ability to focus, especially during exams or schoolwork?
2. What are the dangers of using drugs or alcohol as a way to cope with stress or anxiety?
3. How can you find healthier ways to manage pressure or stress at school?

Case 4: At lunch, a group of popular kids offers a boy a drink that looks like soda, but it's actually alcohol. They say it's just a fun way to fit in, and everyone is doing it at school parties. The boy is nervous but doesn't want to be seen as uncool.

1. How does drinking alcohol at a young age affect your ability to focus in school and your future goals?
2. What can you say or do if you're offered alcohol or drugs by others?
3. How does being part of a group influence your choices, and how can you resist negative influences?

## 4. Group Discussion: Resisting Peer Pressure and Staying Focused on Studying (15 Minutes)

Step 1: Brainstorm with the group some strategies they could use to resist peer pressure, especially when it comes to drugs and alcohol. Write their ideas on a flip chart or whiteboard.

Step 2: Encourage them to think of situations where they might be pressured to try drugs or alcohol and how they can respond confidently. (Facilitator note: there is a likelihood that somebody at home or in their family drinks alcohol or uses drugs. Use your discretion to lean on those examples without causing embarrassment; but it's important to mention family when talking about social and/or behavioral issues.)

## Examples:

- Saying no firmly and confidently.
- Walking away from the situation.
- Speaking to a trusted adult about the pressure they're feeling.
- Surrounding themselves with friends who respect their choices.
- Analyzing the negative impacts that substance abuse has on the family and avoiding following in those footsteps.

## 5. Wrap-Up: My Education, My Future (5 Minutes)

Step 1: Ask participants to take a moment to reflect on how drugs, alcohol, and peer pressure could impact their education and future.

Step 2: Then, ask them to write down one way they will protect their education and stay focused on their goals. Collect the notes or let them keep them as a reminder.

- What did you learn from hearing others' stories about peer pressure and overcoming challenges?
- How do you feel when you resist negative influences from friends?
- What can you do in your community to help others stay away from drugs and alcohol?

## MONTH 6: EMOTIONS AND TAKING CARE OF MY MENTAL HEALTH

Objective: Recognize and manage emotions by identifying stressors, exploring the costs of harmful and restrictive masculine norms, and learning coping strategies.

## Session 6: The Many Emotions of Manhood

This session introduces boys to the importance of understanding and managing emotions, especially during puberty. Through interactive activities like 'Blowing Up the Balloon' and role-plays, boys explore the scenarios that affect their mental health and learn about the consequences of suppressing emotions. They also brainstorm and practice healthy coping mechanisms, emphasizing the value of seeking support from trusted individuals and professionals. The session ends with a tangible reminder - the 'Helping Hand' - to reinforce the importance of building and relying on a support network.

## Objectives:

1. Understand the wide range of emotions they may experience and identify situations that can impact their mental health and well-being.
2. Recognize the consequences of suppressing emotions on their physical and mental health, education, and overall well-being, particularly within the context of societal expectations around masculinity.
3. Learn and practice healthy coping mechanisms for managing emotions and stress, including building support networks, self-care activities, and mindfulness practices.
4. Feel empowered to seek help when needed and understand that asking for support is a strength, not a weakness.

## Key Takeaways for Boys:

1. Emotions are normal and healthy; they need to be understood and expressed.
2. Suppressing emotions can harm mental and physical health, friendships, and school performance.
3. Coping mechanisms and support networks are essential for managing emotions and improving well-being.

## Materials Needed:

- Chart paper or whiteboard to write responses during the discussion
- Markers
- Small jar or container
- Slips of paper with different emotions written on them (e.g., happy, sad, embarrassed, angry, frustrated, scared, proud)
- Balloons (enough for demonstrations and possibly extras for participants)
- Blank sheets of paper (enough for each participant)
- Colored pencils, crayons, or markers for tracing and writing
- Timer or watch to manage time for each activity

## Activity  Structure

## 1. Name That Feeling (5 minutes)

Step 1: Pass around a 'feelings jar' containing slips of paper with different emotions written on them (e.g., happy, sad, embarrassed, angry, frustrated, scared, proud).

Step 2: Ask each boy to pull out a slip, read the emotion aloud, and share a situation where they might feel that way.

Step 3: Say, 'Emotions are a natural part of being human. Today, we'll talk about how to understand and manage them, especially when things get tough.'

## 2. Blowing Up the Balloon (15 minutes)

Step 1: Show the boys a balloon and explain that emotions can build up inside us, just like air in a balloon. Particularly when bad things happen and we get sad or angry.

Step 2: Ask the boys to brainstorm situations that can 'add air to the balloon' (e.g., failing a test, being teased, feeling rejected, family problems). Write these on chart paper.

Step 3: As they share, blow into the balloon to illustrate the emotional buildup.

Step 4: When the balloon is full, ask, 'What happens if we don't let the air out?' (Let the balloon pop or release air slowly to emphasize the need for healthy coping.)

Alternative ways: 1) you could hand out 1 balloon to each boy and then you would name situations and they would blow into their own balloon. This would allow them to experience it first hand and have fun with it. 2) you could keep naming situations until one of the balloons actually pops and use that as a metaphor. (however, facilitators should be mindful of kids with sensitivity to loud noises (on the autism spectrum or survivors of trauma, in zones of post-conflict recovery etc. where the sound of popped balloons might create negative reactions)

## 3. Masking our Emotions (20 minutes)

Step 1: Give each participant a blank paper and ask them to draw an outline of a mask. Explain that the mask represents what people show to the outside world.

Step 2: Ask participants to write or draw on the outside of the mask emotions or behaviors they feel they are expected to show as boys (e.g., strong, brave, tough). This could also be ways they act to fit in or hide vulnerability.

Step 3: Have them flip the paper and focus on the inner side of the mask. Ask them to write or draw emotions they feel but don't share with others (e.g., sadness, fear, embarrassment).

Step 4: Facilitate a discussion that

- Ask volunteers to share one thing they wrote or drew.
- Link this to the 'Man Box' concept: What happens when boys feel forced to wear a 'mask' all the time? How does this affect their mental health, education, and relationships?
- Follow-Up Questions:
- How does wearing a 'mask' make it harder to focus on school or ask for help when you need it?
- What would happen if boys could express their real emotions without fear of judgment?
- What can we do to support one another in taking off the mask?

## 4. Healthy Coping Mechanisms - Emotional Treasure Hunt (15 minutes)

Preparation: Write different coping mechanisms on slips of paper (e.g., 'Talk to a trusted adult,' 'Take deep breaths,' 'Play a sport,' 'Listen to music you enjoy,' 'Spend time with friends,' 'Write down your thoughts').

Hide these slips around the room or outdoor space like a treasure hunt. Additionally, write four flipcharts with the titles 'Support Network', 'Self-Care Activities', 'Mindfulness Practices', 'Professional Help'.

Step 1: Let participants search for the hidden 'treasures.' Once they find one, they bring it back to a central area and read it aloud.

Step 2: Have participants sort the 'treasures' into the appropriate category on the four flipcharts.

Step 3: Once all of the coping mechanisms have been found, review them again and ask if the boys have any others they want to add.

Step 4: Hand out a worksheet or blank paper for participants to write down:

- One coping mechanism they already use and like.
- One new coping mechanism they'd like to try.
- Someone they trust to talk to if they're feeling overwhelmed.

## Step 5: Reflect as a group:

- What were some of the most useful coping strategies you found?
- How could using these strategies help you when you're stressed about school or life?
- Who are some people you can rely on in tough times?

## 5. The 'Helping Hand' (5 minutes)

Step 1: Have each boy traces their hand on a piece of paper.

Step 2: Inside the hand, they write the names of five people they can turn to for support when feeling overwhelmed.

Step 3: Encourage them to keep this 'Helping Hand' as a reminder of their support network. Remind them 'you are never alone. There are people who care about you and want to help. Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.'

- Optional: Access to phones or tablets for participants to analyze social media feeds (if culturally/contextually appropriate)

## Activity Structure

## 1. Welcome and Introduction (10 Minutes)

Step 1: Introduce the topic for today by saying 'we've talked about respect in relationships, and today we're going to dive into online messages. Some content can be uplifting, but others might affect how we see ourselves and how we focus in school. Let's talk about how the messages we get online can either support or hurt our education and well-being.'

Step 2: Facilitate a discussion using these guiding questions:

- What are some messages you see online about what it means to 'be a man'?
- Have you seen disrespectful or harmful content about women or girls? How did it make you feel?
- How do these kinds of messages impact people in your community or your focus on schoolwork?

## 2. Recognizing Online Messages (20 Minutes)

Step 2: Show a short video or provide a scenario (e.g., a meme, ad, or influencer video).

Step 3: Small Group Discussions:

- What is the message being shared in the video/scenario?
- Is it healthy or harmful? Why?
- How could this message affect boys, girls, or the community if it spreads?

Adaptation for Social Media: If phones are available, participants can scroll through their feeds to identify gender-related messages and discuss how these might influence their focus on school and learning.

## 3. 'Digital Check-Up' Workshop (15 Minutes)

Step 1: Ask participants to consider how much time they spend online, what they view, search or do during that time, and how it impacts their learning and concentration.

Step 2: Create a T-chart with examples of healthy (e.g., using educational apps, watching videos that teach you something, linked to your hobbies, art, music) and unhealthy (e.g., excessive gaming, consuming negative content) online behaviors. Have the boys participate in filling in the chart.

Step 3: Have each participant write down one change they can make to their digital habits to improve both well-being and educational focus (e.g., using digital tools to enhance learning, spending less time on distracting platforms).

Step 4: Facilitate a discussion using the following questions:

Step 3: Discuss which strategies worked best, and how these strategies can support a healthy and positive online environment that values education.

Step 4: Facilitate a discussion with the following questions:

- How can you stay respectful when responding to harmful content?
- What's the best way to help others think critically about the messages they share, especially those that may affect their education?
- How can you use digital platforms to promote a love for learning and positive engagement in school?

## For a slightly more complex set of scenarios, check out the handout on Page XX.

Facilitator Note: Scenario 9 about sharing photos without consent is a serious matter and should be covered, especially if this is a challenge in your context. Additionally, you can mention that even if the picture is 'not real' or AI generated, the harm is still there, and it's usually illegal. As the facilitator, you have the responsibility to remind the students of the law of your country.

## 5. Session Wrap-Up and Key Takeaways (5 Minutes)

Step 1: Close the session by saying 'Today, we've seen that the messages we get online can have a huge impact on how we view ourselves, others, and even our education. By being mindful of what we consume, and how we respond, we can support our own well-being and promote positive, respectful behavior online. And remember, the time and energy you put into online spaces should help you learn and grow, not distract or discourage you.'

## Optional Handout for Digital Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Negative Body Image and Unrealistic Expectations

You're scrolling through a social media platform and see a post by an influencer or AI avatar who is promoting a specific body type and lifestyle, claiming it's the only way to be a 'real man.' The post has lots of likes and comments, and some of your classmates are engaging with it.

Questions: How would you respond to the post or to classmates who agree with it? How can you encourage a healthy understanding of body image and masculinity?

## Scenario 2: Bullying or Disrespectful Comments in Gaming

While playing an online game, you hear a teammate making mean comments about another player's appearance and mocking them for being a 'weak' player. You're upset because it goes against the values of respect you've learned, but you feel uncomfortable speaking up.

Questions: How can you address the bullying in a way that doesn't escalate the situation? What could you say to remind the group of the importance of respect and sportsmanship?

## Scenario 3: Gambling Promoted in a Meme

A friend shares a meme in your group chat that jokingly promotes gambling, saying things like 'Real men know how to bet big and win.' The meme has some likes and is getting a lot of attention.

Questions: How would you approach your friend? How can you explain why gambling isn't a healthy or positive way to deal with challenges or risks, especially for young people?

## Scenario 4: Harmful Masculinity in a Viral Video

A viral video comes up in your social media feed where an influencer is making fun of men who express emotions or vulnerability, claiming that 'real men never cry.' It has been shared by a few people in your school.

Questions: How would you respond to this video? What can you say to your peers about why showing emotions is actually a healthy part of masculinity?

## Scenario 5: Disrespectful Language Toward Women

During an online chat or gaming session, one of your friends uses disrespectful language toward women, saying something inappropriate or offensive. Others in the group start laughing, making it feel like it's okay to use such language.

Questions:  How do you speak up about this? What is an appropriate way to explain why this language is harmful and disrespectful?

## Scenario 6: Harmful Gender Roles in an Ad

You come across an ad for a product that plays into traditional gender stereotypes, like telling boys to be tough and not show weakness, while girls are encouraged to be delicate or 'perfect.' This ad feels limiting to you.

Questions: How would you discuss the ad with your friends or classmates? What's a better way to promote positive behaviors for boys and girls without enforcing limiting stereotypes?

## Scenario 7: Online Pranks or Mean Jokes

Someone shares a video of a prank where a boy is tricked into doing something embarrassing for views, with the caption 'Real men can take a joke.' The video gets lots of views, but it's clear the person being pranked feels humiliated.

Questions:  How would you respond to the video or to your friends who think it's funny? How can you help create an online culture that promotes kindness and respect instead of humiliation?

## Scenario 8: Toxic Influence of 'Manosphere' Content

You stumble upon a video where some individuals are teaching boys that being a 'real man' means controlling women or using aggression to get ahead in life. The video has a lot of views and seems to be influencing some of your peers.

Questions:  How can you challenge the harmful views in the video? What would you say to your friends who are influenced by this type of content? How can you encourage a healthier, more respectful model of masculinity?

## Scenario 9: Sharing Private Messages or Pictures Without Consent

A friend, who is your girlfriend or close friend, shares a private picture or message with you, trusting that it will remain between the two of you. Later, you are tempted to show it to a group of friends, thinking it might make you appear more popular or gain their approval.

Questions: What would you feel if someone shared something private you trusted them with? How would you respond if a friend pressured you to share something private without the other person's permission? What are the potential consequences of sharing sensitive content without permission? How can you help protect the privacy and dignity of your friends?

## Possible Supplemental Activities (Month 7)

As a reminder, supplementary activities are optional, additional activities that the club can engage in beyond the structured sessions. All the activities listed here are connected to this month's theme, but feel free to adapt or choose activities from other months if they better suit your group's interests or context. These activities are meant to inspire, so feel free to modify them as needed to better fit your group's needs.

## Activity 1: Video Game or Radio Program Reflection

Activity Description: Have the boys play a video game or listen to a popular radio program or podcast (choose one that aligns with their interests). Afterward, hold a group discussion about the content, asking the boys to reflect on how the content made them feel, what messages they noticed, and if the content promoted positive or negative behavior.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

1. What messages about masculinity or relationships did you notice in the game or program? Were they positive or harmful?
2. Did the content include any examples of disrespect or harmful behavior? How did that make you feel?
3. How can you apply what you've learned from this experience to make healthier choices online?

## Activity 2: Spot the Fake News

Activity Description: Introduce the boys to the concept of fake news and how misinformation spreads online. Provide a series of sample news headlines, some true and some false, and have the boys work in groups to identify which ones are misleading or fake. Discuss strategies for verifying news before believing or sharing it.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

1. What signs did you notice that helped you determine whether the news was fake or true?
2. Why is it important to verify information before sharing it with others?
3. How can fake news affect people's perceptions of reality and their decisions?

## Activity 3: Coding and Understanding Algorithms

Activity Description: Teach the boys how coding works and introduce them to platforms like Scratch and Code.org, where they can create simple projects. Explain how algorithms work, focusing on how online platforms use them to recommend content. Discuss how algorithms influence what they see online and why it's important to be aware of them.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

1. How do you think the games and videos you see on platforms like YouTube are chosen for you?
2. Why might it be important to be mindful of the content you engage with online?
3. How can coding or understanding algorithms help you make smarter choices online?

## MONTH 8: VIOLENCE PREVENTION

Objective: Discuss different types of violence boys experience and learn strategies for intervening safely and effectively in violent situations.

**Facilitator Tip: Before proceeding, please see the Guidance Note on Page XX that details how to respond to disclosures of violence. This is imperative before dealing with the discussions included in this session. When possible facilitators should focus on the root causes of violence and not justify violence on the basis of culture. Facilitators can also speak with women and girls ahead of the sessions to gain insights about the different types of violence they face and any other messages they'd like emphasized with the boys.

## Session 8: Understanding Violence and Preventing It

This 90-minute activity helps boys (ages 9-12) explore the concept of violence, understand its different forms, and examine the connection between power and violence in their daily lives. Through discussion, scenarios, and interactive role-plays, boys will identify strategies to safely prevent or intervene in violent situations. The activity emphasizes empathy, teamwork, and practical skills to promote safety and non-violence in their schools and communities. By the end, boys will feel empowered to take positive actions that contribute to healthier and more inclusive environments.

## Objectives:

1. Understand the concept of violence, its different forms, and its negative consequences.
2. Explore the connection between power, control, and violence.
3. Identify violence in their communities and schools.
4. Practice strategies to prevent or safely intervene in violent situations.
5. Reflect on how they can create safer and healthier relationships in their lives.

## Key Takeaways for Boys:

1. Violence takes many forms, and it's often a negative consequence of power and control.
2. The consequences of violence can use lifelong harm.
3. Everyone can help prevent violence by using safe strategies.
4. Building a safer community starts with individual actions and a commitment to kindness and respect.

## Materials Needed:

- Flip chart paper or a whiteboard and markers (for brainstorming and writing key points).
- Printed handouts with the violence scenario(s) and key intervention strategies (optional).
- Post-it notes or index cards for participants to write down ideas and responses during discussions.
- Pens or pencils for each participant.
- Large poster paper or printed chart with the types of violence (physical, emotional, sexual, economic) for reference.
- Visual aids or images (optional) to depict examples of positive intervention strategies, such as 'Distract,' 'Team Up,' etc.
- Role-play cards with short descriptions of different scenarios for participants to act out (optional).
- Name tags or badges for group roles (e.g., 'Distractor,' 'Supporter') during role-play activities.
- A timer or clock to manage the session's timing.

## Activity Structure

## 1. Welcome and greetings (5 minutes)

## 2. Persons and Things Activity (15 minutes)

Step 1: Ask participants to close their eyes and reflect on the word 'power.' What comes to mind? What images do they see? Allow one minute of quiet reflection.

Step 2: Ask volunteers to share their thoughts.

Step 3: Divide the group into two: 'Persons' and 'Things,'. They should stand in two parallel lines looking directly across at another person.

## Step 4: Explain roles:

- 'Things' cannot talk or make decisions - they must follow the 'Persons' instructions.
- 'Persons' can give instructions to their 'Things' but cannot physically touch them.

Step 5: Set a timer for 2 minutes of role-playing, and then switch roles and repeat for 2 minutes.

## Step 6: Group Discussion:

- When you were the 'Things': How did your person treat you? How did it feel? Would you have liked to be treated differently?
- When you were the 'Persons': How did you treat your 'Things'? How did it feel to treat someone as an object?
- Transition discussion to connect power dynamics to violence:
- Now that we've experienced power dynamics in action, let's reflect on how these dynamics can lead to harm. When someone is treated as an object - unable to make decisions or express themselves - it creates a clear imbalance. How does treating someone like a 'Thing' relate to violence? How might the misuse of power, in this way, lead to different forms of violence, whether emotional, physical, or psychological? This exercise helps us understand how power imbalances can escalate and manifest in harmful behaviors.

## 3. Defining Violence and Types of Violence (20 minutes)

Step 1: Facilitator Introduction:

- Begin by writing the word violence on a flip chart or board.
- Ask: 'What do you think violence means?' Discuss their answers.
- Provide a clear definition: Violence is any threat, action, word, or behavior that harms someone physically, emotionally, sexually, or financially.

Step 2: Introduce the different types of violence (emphasize an act or threat of violence) :

- Physical (e.g., hitting, pushing).
- Emotional (e.g., name-calling, bullying).
- Sexual (e.g., inappropriate touching or comments).
- Economic (e.g., withholding resources like lunch money).

And cover where violence could occur - at school, at home, in the community, online (social media, video games, etc).

Step 3: Ask boys to give examples of where they see these types of violence in their families, schools, communities, or media. Write examples under each category.

Facilitator note: it might be also helpful to talk about who generally experiences violence. Who inflicts it on who? This is also an opportunity to prompt a conversation around violence against oneself and self-harm. Depending on the context, suicide rates among teen boys are rather high and it's important it doesn't remain taboo and suppressed. This obviously needs to be done with care and tact.

Step 4: Discuss how violence can be about power and control.

- Sometimes, people use their strength, popularity, or even their age to control or hurt others. For example, a bigger kid might push someone smaller around because they think they can. Or, a group of friends might make someone feel left out to have control over them.
- Ask some discussion questions connected to this theme:
- Have you ever seen someone use their size or strength to push someone around or make them do something they didn't want to do?
- Can power be about more than just being stronger? Can being popular or knowing more than someone give you power?
- Examples include: In a game, someone takes over the rules or tells others what to do just because they're the best player or the oldest. Someone uses words to hurt someone or makes them feel bad, maybe calling them names or making fun of them.

## 4. Violence Scenario and Intervention Strategies (40 minutes)

Step 1: Read a short scenario aloud, such as:

'Daniel, a 10-year-old boy, is walking home to school when a group of older boys surrounds him. They start teasing him, calling him names about his clothes and saying he's 'weak.' One boy pushes him against the wall and grabs his snack from his bag. The others laugh as they walk away.'

## Step 3: Group Discussion:

- What types of violence are present in the scenario?
- How does power play a role in this situation?
- How do you think the boy being teased feels? How might this affect him at school?

Step 4: Broaden the discussion to violence that they see in the community:

- What are some trends around violence that they see in their school and community?
- How are boys affected by this violence specifically? What does it do to them as they get older?

End the discussion by saying that bullying happens for a lot of different reasons. There is no one specific cause. Bullying causes real harm because it harms everyone's ability to learn and have fun in school!

Step 5: Teach and brainstorm the four methods to stand up to violence that they witness:

## 1. Be a Friend

- What it means: Go up to the person being hurt or bullied and show them they are not alone. Sit with them, talk to them, or play with them.
- Why it works: It shows the person that someone cares and can make them feel supported. It might also make the person doing harm stop because they see others noticing.
2. Get Help from a Grown-Up
- What it means: Find a trusted adult, like a teacher, coach, or parent, and tell them what's happening. Explain what you saw and why you are worried.
- Why it works: Adults have more power to step in and stop harmful behavior, especially when kids don't feel safe handling it on their own.

## 3. Use Kind Words

- What it means: Tell the person causing harm that what they are doing is not okay. Say things like, 'Stop, that's mean,' or 'Let's not do that.' Use a calm and firm voice.
- Why it works: Sometimes people don't realize how hurtful they are being until someone speaks up. A kind but firm reminder can make them think twice.
4. Change the Scene
- What it means: Help distract the person being harmed or shift the attention away from the bad situation. For example, invite the person being hurt to join you in a game or start a new activity to draw attention elsewhere.
- Why it works: It removes the person being harmed from the situation and can stop the harmful behavior without confrontation.

## 5. Closing Reflections (10 minutes)

Step 1: Ask participants:

- What did you learn today about violence and power?
- How can you help prevent violence in your community and school?
- What will you keep doing after today's session?

Step 2: Encourage boys to share one commitment they will make to help prevent violence or use their power positively.

Step 3: Thank the participants and remind them of their ability to create positive change.

## Possible Supplemental Activities (Month 8)

As a reminder, supplementary activities are optional, additional activities that the club can engage in beyond the structured sessions. All the activities listed here are connected to this month's theme, but feel free to adapt or choose activities from other months if they better suit your group's interests or context. These activities are meant to inspire, so feel free to modify them as needed to better fit your group's needs. You can also invite external guests to participate in these activities, such as non-club member boys, girls from the community, teachers, or other relevant figures. As long as the boys are the decision-makers in choosing these activities, it can be a great opportunity for collaboration and community building.

## 1. Organize a Play on Conflict Resolution and Violence Prevention

## Activity Description:

Break learners up into small groups and give them scenarios of violence. Their task is to act out resolutions that demonstrate constructive, non-violent solutions like talking, teamwork, or involving a trusted adult. Boys can act out the solutions to the different scenarios and practice empathy by playing different roles.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What did you learn from the scenarios in the play about how violence can escalate or be prevented? How can avoiding a conflict also be a problem?
- How did the characters resolve their conflict, and what other solutions could they have tried?
- How might you use what you learned in this play to handle real-life situations at school or in your family or community?

## 2. Invite a Survivor to Share Their Story

## Activity Description:

Invite a community member or advocate who has survived violence to speak about their experience, the impact of violence, and how they overcame it. This conversation should be facilitated in a safe, supportive environment and include time for questions.

Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What stood out to you most about the survivor's story?
- How does this story change how you think about violence and its effects on people's lives?
- What can you do to help someone who might be experiencing violence in your community?

## 3. Collaborate with Local Services to Raise Awareness

## Activity Description:

Invite representatives from local organizations, such as the police, social workers, or domestic violence advocates, to educate boys about available services, how to reach out for help, and how children are supported. Focus the discussion on child-friendly approaches and specific steps they can take if they or someone they know needs help.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What did you learn about the resources available in your community to prevent and respond to violence?
- Who are some trusted adults you could go to if you or a friend needed help?
- What steps can you take to spread awareness about these services with others in your school or neighborhood?

## 4. Design a Campaign for 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence 5

## Activity Description:

Engage boys in brainstorming and creating a campaign to raise awareness about violence prevention. This could involve designing posters, hosting events, or collaborating with local NGOs to promote messages of nonviolence and gender equality. Include specific roles for each participant, such as creating artwork, writing messages, or spreading the campaign through social media.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- How do you think your campaign can make a difference in the community?
- What was the most meaningful message or idea you included in the campaign?
- What steps can we take to make this campaign a lasting effort and not just a one-time activity?

## 5. Host a Peer-Led Workshop on Positive Conflict Resolution

## Activity Description:

Train older boys (secondary school students) or group leaders to facilitate a workshop for peers on resolving conflicts peacefully. This can include role-playing different scenarios, brainstorming solutions, and practicing skills like active listening or compromising.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What are some strategies you learned during the workshop for resolving conflicts?
- How do you think these strategies could change how people handle disagreements?
- What challenges might you face when trying to use these strategies, and how can you overcome them?

5 UNESCO definition: SRGBV includes acts or threats of sexual, physical or psychological harm occurring in and around schools or through education systems, driven by harmful gender norms, stereotypes and unequal power dynamics. This violence is further compounded by factors such as ethnicity, culture, poverty and ability which all intersect with gender. For example, violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity or expression including homophobic and transphobic bullying is deeply rooted in gendered beliefs, attitudes and values as well as reflecting broader social norms around sexuality. Addressing school violence therefore requires an understanding of gender dynamics and deep-rooted patriarchal, social and cultural norms.

## MONTH 9: STUDYING TECHNIQUES

Objective: Learn effective study habits, time management skills, and how to create supportive study environments for academic success.

** Facilitator Note: It's advisable that this month is placed a few months ahead of any large national exam period for learners.

## Session 9: Study Smarts

This session aims to challenge harmful and restrictive masculine norms that prioritize independence, self-reliance, and toughness, which often hinder boys' academic success. By exploring effective study habits, time management, the importance of asking for help, and creating supportive study environments, boys will learn how to develop skills that contribute to both academic and personal growth. The activities will also emphasize how collaboration, emotional well-being, and seeking support are strengths, not weaknesses, and that these practices help boys thrive in school and life.

## Objectives:

1. Encourage boys to examine and challenge stereotypes about masculinity (e.g., being tough or independent) that affect their learning and success.
2. Teach boys strategies for time management, note-taking, and creating study environments conducive to success.
3. Reinforce the importance of seeking help when needed and building supportive learning environments where collaboration is valued.
4. Help boys understand that emotional well-being, support, and vulnerability contribute to their academic and personal growth.

## Key Takeaways for Boys:

1. Academic success is not about doing everything alone. Boys are encouraged to challenge the stereotype that asking for help is a weakness. Seeking support is a strength that enhances learning.
2. Time management and effective study environments matter. Creating a balanced study routine and an environment that supports focus and emotional well-being leads to better academic outcomes.
3. Collaboration is key. Successful study habits include working with others and leveraging available resources, whether through teachers, peers, or family.
4. Healthy emotional expression and support networks help boys thrive. It's important to acknowledge emotional well-being as a necessary aspect of academic success and life, challenging the narrative that boys must always be tough or independent.

## Materials Needed:

- Whiteboard/Flipchart &amp; Markers for group discussions and visual reflections
- Timer for time-sensitive activities (like the Relay Race)
- Paper and Pens for drawing study environments and writing reflection answers
- Printed Handouts for discussion questions, study plan templates, and reflection prompts
- Audio/Video Player t o play clips for the note-taking station in the Relay Race
- List of Facts/Items for Memorization (Time Management station) for boys to memorize in the Relay Race

## Activity Structure:

## 1. Welcome and Introduction (10 Minutes)

Step 1: Introduce the topic by saying 'today, we're going to talk about effective study habits and how you can set yourselves up for success. As boys, we're often told that we should always be tough, independent, or that learning comes easy to us. But sometimes, being a good student means asking for help, managing your time, collaborating with friends to learn from each other, and making sure your study space works for you. Let's talk about how you can challenge those ideas and create a study routine that helps you thrive, both in school and in life.'

Step 2: Facilitate a discussion with the following questions

- What are some stereotypes about being a 'man' that you've heard when it comes to studying or asking for help? How do these messages affect your learning?
- How can you challenge these stereotypes to make sure you're doing what works best for your studies?
- How do you think the idea that boys should always be independent or tough impacts how you approach studying or asking for help?

## 2. Study Environment Design (15 Minutes)

Step 1: Ask participants to draw their ideal study space. This could include things like quiet areas, tools they would need, and how they like to study. Encourage them to think about both physical and emotional aspects of a study environment (e.g., how important is it to have support, a comfortable atmosphere, or motivation from family/friends? Which time of the day is it easier for you to pay attention?).

Step 2: Discuss how society sometimes teaches boys to 'do it all on their own,' but asking for help or having a supportive environment is key to success. Highlight the value of a space where they can ask for help or express challenges without feeling less capable or 'weak.' And that they can also help others!

Step 3: Ask boys to reflect on how they can build their study space to be both independent (in terms of focus and discipline) and collaborative (where asking for help or feedback is encouraged, and providing it to others in a helpful way). Explore the idea that boys can thrive academically by integrating their emotional well-being into their study habits.

Step 4: Facilitate a discussion with the following questions

- What aspects of your study space do you need to change to feel comfortable and focused?
- Do you think boys are expected to be independent and avoid asking for help? How does asking for help contribute to your success?
- How does having support in your study space (like from family, friends, or teachers) make a difference in how well you perform?

## 3. Study Skills Stations (15 Minutes)

Set-Up: Create three stations in the room with different study-related tasks:

- Note-taking station: Provide boys with a short, engaging video or audio clip on an interesting topic (e.g., fun science facts or historical tidbits). Ask them to take notes on what they hear/see.
- Time management station: Set a timer for 5 minutes. Provide a list of items (e.g., math facts or vocabulary words) and challenge them to memorize as many items as possible in the time given.
- Help station: Boys will be presented with a challenging question. To solve it, they must ask one of their teammates for help. They must use polite and respectful language (e.g., 'Can you please help me with this problem?').

Step 1: Divide the boys into 3 teams and assign them to one of the stations.

Step 2: Have the groups perform the tasks at the station and then rotate until they have done all of the stations.

Step 3: Reflect on the idea that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Challenge the notion that boys should always figure things out on their own or never ask for help. Discuss how society might encourage boys to avoid asking for help or admitting when they don't know something, but in school, asking for help is an essential tool for success.

Step 4: Facilitate a discussion with the following questions

1. Which station did you find the easiest, and why?
2. How did it feel to ask for help at the Help Station?
3. What do you think is the best way to manage your time and avoid cramming last minute, and how can asking for help fit into your study plan?

## 4. My Perfect Study Plan (10 Minutes)

Step 1: Ask the boys to take a piece of paper and divide it into 4 sections:

- What I need to study: (e.g., math, science, history, etc.)
- When I can study: (e.g., after school, weekends, morning before school,  etc.)
- How I will break up my time: (e.g., 20 minutes for math, 15 minutes for science, etc.)
- Who can help me: (e.g., a teacher, a parent, a classmate, or a tutor).

Step 2: Have them fill out their sheet with answers that reflect their next month or two of school. It's even better if they have a big exam coming up that they can plan for.

Step 3: Encourage them to include who they can ask for help, reinforcing the importance of collaboration and the value of mentorship or support. Remind them that relying on others to succeed is not a weakness - it's part of developing academic strength, resilience, and support systems.

Step 4: Discuss how boys are often socialized to handle problems on their own, but this can lead to burnout. Learning to break tasks into manageable chunks and asking for support leads to better academic outcomes, healthier mental well-being and strong bonds among friends.

Step 5: Facilitate a discussion with the following questions

- How can breaking your study time into smaller chunks and asking for help challenge the idea that boys need to handle everything by themselves?
- What's one thing you can do to make sure you stay on track during your study time?
- Who can you reach out to for help if you don't understand something, and how can asking for help make your study time more effective?

## 5. Wrap-up and Q&amp;A (10 Minutes)

Step 1: Close the session by saying 'today we learned some great study habits, including how to manage our time, create a good study space and study environment, and ask for help when we need it. It's important to remember that studying doesn't have to be stressful - it's about creating a plan that works for you and sticking to it little by little. Let's review what we learned today - what are the key things you'll take away from today's session?'

Step 2: Allow the boys to share their thoughts and questions.

## Possible Supplemental Activities (Month 9)

As a reminder, supplementary activities are optional, additional activities that the club can engage in beyond the structured sessions. All the activities listed here are connected to this month's theme, but feel free to adapt or choose activities from other months if they better suit your group's interests or context. These activities are meant to inspire, so feel free to modify them as needed to better fit your group's needs. You can also invite external guests to participate in these activities, such as non-club member boys, girls from the community, teachers, or other relevant figures. As long as the boys are the decision-makers in choosing these activities, it can be a great opportunity for collaboration and community building.

## 1. Advocate for a 'Study Space' at School

## Activity Description:

Encourage the boys to advocate for a designated study space at school, especially for busy times like before exams. They could brainstorm ideas for how this space would look and what would make it more productive (e.g., quiet areas, resources, and even designated study hours).

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- Why is it important to have a dedicated study space in school, especially before exams?
- How might advocating for such a space help everyone, not just yourself?
- How can you communicate the need for a study space in a way that others will support it?

## 2. Visit the Local Library or Community Center

## Activity Description:

Arrange a visit to a local library or community center with a quiet study area. Boys should observe how the space is organized and consider how such an environment can help with their academic focus. They could also explore resources or study groups available in these spaces.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What did you learn about creating a quiet study space during your visit to the library/community center?
- How do you think using a library or community center as a study space can help you manage your time better?
- What resources did you find at the library/community center that could help you with your studies?

## 3. Memorization Games: Trivia Treasure Hunt

## Activity Description:

Create a fun trivia treasure hunt where the boys are tasked with memorizing key facts or information related to their studies. For example, they could have questions on history, literature, science, or math, with clues hidden around the room or the school. Boys work in teams to gather answers and piece together a 'treasure' (a reward or small prize).

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- How did working as a team help you remember information in the trivia treasure hunt?
- What did you learn about your own study habits during this activity?
- How do you think games like this could make studying more fun and engaging?

## 4. Flashcard Bingo

## Activity Description:

Create flashcards with important concepts from their subjects (e.g., math formulas, vocabulary, historical dates) and play a round of Bingo. Boys will draw flashcards one at a time, calling out the answers to fill their Bingo cards. This can be done individually or in small groups.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- How did the Flashcard Bingo game help you remember key concepts better than just reading your notes?
- What makes a study technique like this more effective than cramming the night before?
- How does reviewing material through active learning (like games) improve your long-term memory?

## 5. Quiz Show Game

## Activity Description:

Set up a 'Quiz Show' style game where boys are quizzed on subjects they are currently studying. Divide them into teams and ask questions that require them to explain concepts rather than just memorize answers.

Award points for correct answers, teamwork,  and provide immediate feedback.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- What did you learn about your strengths and weaknesses during the Quiz Show game?
- How did working with a team help you understand the material better?
- Why do you think being able to explain concepts out loud is a good study skill?

## 6. Study Group at Home or School

## Activity Description:

Encourage boys to form or join a study group with their friends. They can set up times to meet either virtually or in-person, review materials together, and quiz each other on key topics. This encourages collaboration and helps normalize asking for help from others.

## Follow-Up Discussion Questions:

- How did working in a study group help you understand your subjects more clearly?
- How did you contribute to the group, and how did others contribute to your learning?
- Why is it helpful to ask questions and share ideas with others when studying?

## MONTH 10: RELATIONSHIPS AND FRIENDSHIPS

Objective: Build stronger, more respectful friendships and relationships through activities that promote empathy and mutual understanding.

## Session 10: Navigating Changing Relationships

This one-hour session focuses on helping boys understand the changes that occur in friendships and relationships as they grow older. Puberty often brings shifts in how boys interact with others, especially with the opposite sex, and this session aims to provide them with tools to navigate these changes respectfully. The session explores how friendships may evolve, including the possibility of romantic interest developing, and emphasizes the importance of communication, setting healthy boundaries, and challenging societal gender expectations about relationships.

## Objectives:

1. Understand how friendships and relationships can evolve during puberty.
2. Recognize the importance of healthy communication in both platonic and romantic relationships.
3. Develop skills to navigate changing dynamics in friendships, including how to express feelings respectfully and maintain healthy boundaries.
4. Explore how societal gender norms influence their perceptions of relationships and how they can challenge them for healthier connections.

## Key Takeaways for Boys:

1. Relationships, whether romantic or friendships, are built on trust, respect, and good communication. As you grow, these relationships will change, and that's okay.
2. Puberty can lead to shifts in friendships. You may start developing different interests or feelings for people, and it's important to acknowledge and navigate those changes respectfully.
3. Setting boundaries is essential in maintaining healthy relationships. Both emotional and physical boundaries should be respected.
4. Many boys are taught to be tough or hide their emotions, but healthy relationships require openness, vulnerability, and respect for others' feelings.

## Materials Needed:

- Flipchart and markers
- Handouts with key points on healthy relationships and boundaries (optional)
- Role-play scenarios (printed or displayed)
- Blank paper and pens for reflection exercises
- Timer for role-play activity timing

## Activity Structure:

## 1. Good Friend, Bad Friend (10 minutes)

Step 1: Ask the boys to reflect on what makes a good friend.

Step 2: On the whiteboard, draw two columns labeled 'Good Friend' and 'Bad Friend.' Ask the boys to shout out qualities they think a good friend should have (e.g., kind, supportive, trustworthy) and qualities of a bad friend (e.g., mean, unreliable, disrespectful).

Step 3: Write down their answers in each column.

Step 4: Facilitate a discussion using the following questions:

- What qualities did we list that you think are most important in a friendship?
- Can a boy be tough and still be a good friend? Why or why not?

## 2. Move Your Feet - Healthy Friendships (15 minutes)

Step 1: Explain the rules: 'I'll read a statement, and you will decide if you agree or disagree. If you agree, move to the 'Agree' side of the room. If you disagree, move to the 'Disagree' side.'

Step 2: After each statement, allow the boys to briefly explain their reasoning, especially if they were in the minority side.

## Statements

1. 'A real friend always has your back, even when no one else does.'
2. 'If your friend does something wrong, it's okay to call them out.'
3. 'It's not okay to make fun of a friend in front of others, even if it's just a joke.'
4. 'Boys and girls can't be 'just friends' because there's always a chance of romantic feelings.'
5. 'You should only be friends with people who like the same things as you.'
6. 'Friends should always support you, even if you're making a bad decision.'
7. 'A good friend listens to you when you're upset, even if they don't know how to fix things.'
8. 'It's okay to keep secrets from your friend if it's something personal.'
9. 'It's okay to stop being friends with someone if they're treating you badly, even if they're popular.'
10. 'It's important to spend time with both your friends and family, but sometimes friends are more important.'

Step 3: For each statement, encourage them to listen to each other's points of view, reflect on the importance of respect, and understand that different perspectives exist when it comes to friendships.

Step 4: Facilitate a discussion using the following questions:

- How might traditional ideas of boyhood, like not showing emotions, make it hard to form healthy friendships?
- Why is it important to express emotions and communicate openly with friends?
- How can you show respect and support for your friends, even when you're going through tough times? Or hold different viewpoints?

## 3. Understanding Relationship Changes During Puberty (30 minutes)

Step 1: Start by acknowledging that puberty brings changes in both boys' and girls' lives - physically, emotionally, and socially.

Step 2: Lead a group discussion on how relationships with friends might change as they get older. Some boys may start spending less time with girls due to social pressures, and others might start having romantic feelings toward another person for the first time. Use this time to explore how these feelings can affect relationships.

- How do you think relationships between boys and girls change as you get older? Why might boys and girls spend less time together during puberty?

- Have you ever noticed a friend becoming interested in a romantic relationship? How did that affect your friendship with them?
- What does it mean to have a romantic relationship at your age? How is it different from a friendship?

Step 3: Choose 3-4 short scenarios from the handout at the end of this session that involve common challenges in friendships in your context.

Step 4: Assign roles to different boys to act out the scenarios. Have the actors role-play different ways to handle the situation, encouraging respectful, supportive, and empathetic responses.

Step 5: After each role-play, discuss how the situation was handled and how gender norms influenced the responses.

Facilitator note: A common theme throughout these scenarios is that 'being a good friend' won't mean that their feelings are automatically reciprocated, and that learning to accept rejection is also a part of growing up as a good person. This is particularly true for romantic conquest - where boys are generally taught that insist and try again and again, girls will eventually give in. Conversations about boundaries can be brought into this session - with an emphasis of an 'enthusiastic yes'.

## 5. Wrap-Up and Key Takeaways (5 minutes)

Step 1: Recap the key points discussed in the session: qualities of a good friend, how to challenge gender norms, and how boys can express emotions and support each other.

Step 2: Invite boys to share one thing they learned today that they will apply in their friendships.

Step 3: Thank them for participating and encourage them to be mindful of how they can support their friends in healthy ways.

## MONTH 11: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Objective: Explore pressures to earn, risks of borrowing, and strategies for budgeting and saving while staying in school.

## Session 11: Building Your Future with Smart Money Choices

This one-hour session focuses on teaching boys the fundamentals of financial management, with an emphasis on challenging gender norms related to earning money, budgeting, and saving. The session explores the pressures boys may face to financially support their families and discusses the risks of borrowing and gambling. Through hands-on activities, boys will learn how to create a budget, save for future goals, and understand the importance of staying in school for long-term financial success. The session encourages boys to think critically about their financial choices and inform them about decisions around money.

## Objectives:

1. Explore the pressures boys face around earning money, and how these pressures are shaped by gender expectations.
2. Understand the risks of borrowing money, gambling, and how to make smart financial decisions.
3. Learn how staying in school and obtaining an education can open up better financial opportunities.
4. Gain hands-on experience with budgeting, saving, and planning for financial success in a way that supports their well-being and future goals.

## Key Takeaways for Boys:

1. Money management is not just about earning; it's about making responsible decisions that set you up for a better future.
2. The pressure to 'provide' can lead to poor financial decisions; it's important to know when to ask for help and when to say no to risky behavior.
3. Education is a long-term investment that will pay off in bigger ways in the future.
4. Budgeting, saving, and understanding the risks of borrowing or gambling are essential skills for building financial security.

## Materials Needed:

- Coins (or play money) for activities.
- Paper and pens for budget creation.
- Printed 'interest rates' and 'gambling risks' scenario cards .
- Whiteboard and markers .
- Simple budgeting template or handout .

## Activity Structure

## 1. Introduction to Money and Pressures (5 minutes)

Step 1: Ask 'What kinds of things do you think boys are expected to do to earn money? Why do you think there is pressure for boys to be the ones to make money in the family or community? What are the benefits of women earning money?'

Step 2: Discuss how traditional gender roles often place financial responsibility on boys as they grow older, and how societal expectations of masculinity influence how they view earning money (e.g., feeling the need to 'provide' or 'be strong').

## 2. The Coin Toss Challenge (15 minutes)

Step 1: Begin by explaining to the boys that they will be participating in a coin toss betting game.

Step 2: Briefly explain what gambling is and why it can be risky. Emphasize that sometimes, people gamble to try to make quick money, but they often end up losing more than they gain.

Step 3: Explain the Rules:

- Step 1: Each boy starts with one coin (or token).
- Step 2: They choose whether they want to bet their coin on 'heads' or 'tails' for the next coin toss.
- Step 3: The facilitator tosses the coin, and everyone guesses whether it will land on heads or tails.
- Step 4: After the coin lands, if a boy's guess was correct, he doubles his bet (receives another coin). If his guess was wrong, he loses the coin he bet.

Step 4: Repeat the process and continue the game for several rounds, encouraging boys to think about their decisions each time. They may choose to bet again, change their bet, or stop altogether.

Step 5: After 3-4 rounds, pause the game for a discussion.

- 'What does this game remind you of when people gamble in real life?'
- Discuss the risks of gambling:
- How easy it is to lose money.
- The excitement of winning and the frustration of losing.
- Why gambling can lead to bigger financial problems.
- 'Can you think of situations where gambling might have serious consequences? Have you seen gambling in your community?'
- 'How can we protect ourselves from making risky financial decisions?'
- Explain how boys might feel more pressure to engage in risky behaviors, including gambling, because of masculine expectations of toughness or risk-taking. Discuss how these pressures might affect financial decision-making.

## 3. Scenario Role Play: Borrowing Money and Interest (15 minutes)

Step 1: Split the boys into small groups (3-4 boys per group).

Step 2: Give each group a scenario card with a borrowing situation (listed below).

Step 3: Explain that each group will role-play a situation where one person is borrowing money, and the others will act as the lender and guide them through the borrowing decision.

Step 4: Explain the roles

- Borrower: This person needs money and is considering borrowing it from a lender. They will have to decide if borrowing is a good idea based on the interest they'll have to pay.
- Lender: This person is lending the money to the borrower and needs to explain the terms, including the interest they will charge.
- Observer (optional): If needed, assign one person to observe and provide feedback or help with the decision-making process.

Step 5: Quickly explain how interest works. For example, if you borrow $10 and the interest rate is 20%, you would owe $12 in total (because 20% of $10 is $2). Stress that interest is the extra amount you have to pay on top of the amount you borrowed, and it increases over time.

Step 6: Give each group a scenario card with a borrowing situation. Ensure they understand the situation before they start the role-play.

Step 7: Give each group 5-7 minutes to role-play. They should discuss whether borrowing is a good idea, how the interest will affect how much the borrower needs to pay back, and how they would explain the borrowing terms to each other. For younger boys, consider doing 1 example all together instead of breaking into groups.

Step 8: Discuss the risks of borrowing money and how it can affect personal finances. Reflect on how interest can add up quickly, and the impact it can have on relationships.

Step 9: Discuss how society often pushes boys to be independent and to 'solve problems' on their own, sometimes leading them to make quick financial decisions without fully understanding the consequences. Emphasize the importance of being educated and asking for help when needed.

Step 10: If time allows, facilitate a discussion with the following questions:

- How can borrowing money with interest impact your financial future?
- Why is it important to know exactly how much money you will have to repay when you borrow?
- How can you avoid making quick financial decisions that could put you in debt?

## 4. Budgeting Challenge (15 minutes)

Step 1: Begin by explaining the concept of budgeting: it's a way to plan how to spend and save money wisely.

Step 2: Highlight that everyone has a limited amount of money, so it's important to decide how much to spend and how much to save to achieve future goals.

Step 3: Provide each boy with a simple budgeting template. The template should have the following categories:

- Income (e.g., $50 fictional money)
- Expenses (e.g., school supplies, food, entertainment)
- Savings (space for setting aside money for the future)

Step 4: Tell them that they have $50 to work with (or another amount appropriate for their age group). This will be their 'income' for the exercise. Ensure they understand that they must budget their income across the different categories.

Step 5: Give the boys a list of expenses they need to allocate their money toward. These might include:

- School supplies
- Transport to school
- Food/snacks
- Savings
- Entertainment (e.g., video games, movies)
- Miscellaneous (e.g., small personal items)

The boys should decide how much of their $50 to allocate to each category. Encourage them to think about the importance of saving some money for the future while still meeting their immediate needs.

Step 6: After they've made their initial budget, introduce an unexpected expense. For example: 'Your phone broke, and you need to spend $10 to repair it.'

Step 7: Ask the boys to adjust their budget by reallocating money to cover the unexpected expense. This step helps them practice flexibility and planning for the unexpected.

Step 8: Once all the boys have completed their budget plans, bring them together for a group discussion.

- What did you learn about balancing spending and saving money?
- What would you do if an unexpected expense came up?
- Why is it important to save for your future?

Step 9: Lead a discussion about how societal expectations can affect the way boys manage money. Highlight that boys may feel pressure to spend money on things like flashy clothes or gadgets to show status. Discuss the importance of balancing spending with saving to achieve long-term goals. Emphasize that financial responsibility and healthy money habits are key to building a secure future and that it's okay to make decisions based on future needs, not just immediate wants.

## 5. 'Staying in School vs. Earning Now' Brainstorm (10 minutes)

Step 1: Have the boys break into small groups and brainstorm ways they can support their families without dropping out of school.

Step 2: After 5 minutes, each group shares their ideas with the larger group.

Step 3: Ask 'What are some benefits of staying in school when you think about your future job opportunities? How does education help you earn more money in the long run?'

Step 4: Discuss how boys often feel the pressure to prioritize work over education to 'become the man of the house,' especially in lower-income families. Encourage them to think of school as an investment in their future financial stability, and that it's okay to ask for help and rely on education to achieve long-term success.

## HANDOUT: BORROWING AND INTEREST SCENARIOS

1. Split young people into two to three groups with about five to ten people each. Each group should form a tight circle, with everyone sticking their hands into the center.
2. Instruct everyone to, with one hand, grab the hand of another person. Then, using the other hand, they should grab the hand of someone different. Explain that the object of the game is to get untangled without letting go. By climbing, crawling, and wriggling around, young people can create one large open circle or, sometimes, two unconnected ones.
3. Have participants begin untangling themselves. If they are totally stuck, you can tell groups they can choose to undo one link and then reconnect once that person has turned around, seeing if that works.

(This energizer is fun and creates a nice physical bond among young people. It also subtly communicates ideas of working together to accomplish a task.)

## Shrinking Iceberg

1. Split young people into two groups of five to eight people each.
2. Put two blankets or several sheets of newspaper on the floor. Ask each group to stand on one blanket or newspapered area.
3. Explain that this is an iceberg that is melting, reducing in size by half every month. The objective is to see which full team can stay on the iceberg longer.
4. Ask the teams to get off their blanket and fold it in half (or remove half the paper). Have the teams try to fit everyone back on the blanket/paper.
5. Repeat Step 4 until one team cannot fit everyone on the iceberg. Each time, see how the teams find ways to support each other to allow everyone to stay on. The team that keeps everyone on the iceberg for the most rounds wins.

## Hot Pepper

1. Gather the young people in a circle. Toss a ball (or another tossable object) gently to a participant. Young people should continue gently tossing the ball, saying 'Hot' when they catch it.
2. As the ball is being tossed around, randomly call out, 'Pepper!' The person holding the ball when 'Pepper!' is called is removed from the circle.
3. Have participants keep tossing the ball until only one person is left.

## The Rainstorm

1. Ask the young people to stand in a circle with their eyes closed.
2. Say that a rainstorm is approaching.
3. Ask everyone to rub their palms against their pant legs.
4. Then, ask them to lightly pat their thighs with their fingertips.
5. Ask them to do it harder. Then, ask them to pat their hands against their thighs.
6. Have them start slapping their hands faster and faster against their thighs.
7. After a while, go back to lighter slapping, then patting, etc., to reverse the entire order until it is quiet again and the storm has passed.

(This is a physical but calming exercise that can be used as a closer.)

## I'm Going to the Store …

1. Create a circle of chairs in the center of the room. Have enough chairs so that only one person does not have one.

2. Have one person stand in the center of the circle and the others be seated. The standing person should start the game by saying, 'I'm going to the store, and I'm taking my friend who … ' and choosing a trait that some of the people seated have. For example, 'I'm going to the store, and I'm taking my friend who has a red shirt on.' All the participants with a red shirt on should get up and race to another chair, including the person in the center, leaving the remaining person without a chair to stand in the middle of the circle.
3. The next person in the center repeats the phrase with a new trait. The rule is that young people MUST get up and move to another chair if the trait applies to them. They cannot move to the chair next to them.
4. Repeat several times.

## Stomp Pattern

1. Teach the young people a three-count stomp pattern and do it together. (For example: stomp-stomp-clap, stomp-stomp-clap.)
2. Then, teach the young people a four-count stomp pattern. (For example: stomp-stomp-stomp-clap, stomp-stomp-stomp-clap.)
3. Divide the young people in half. Have one group do the first pattern and the other do the second pattern at the same time.
4. If there is a bit more time, you can have individuals create their own patterns for the group to imitate.
