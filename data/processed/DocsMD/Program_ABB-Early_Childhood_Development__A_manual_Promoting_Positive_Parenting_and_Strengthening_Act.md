## Program ABB - Early Childhood Development

Promoting Positive Parenting and Strengthening Active Father's Involvement in Early Childhood Development

## Foreword

In light of this challenging period that Lebanon is going through, we are launching this pioneering national program that targets families in Lebanon, 'Program Abb', to promote positive parenting and involve fathers in early childhood development.

Family issues are among the priorities of the Ministry of Social Affairs' intervention, as the family is the basic pillar of society and targeting it constitutes a guarantee for the sustainability of integrated care for every child, enhances the roles of parents and achieves equality and fairness between the mother and the father. Also, working with the family through positive parenting based on partnership between its members has a positive impact on the sustainability of comprehensive community development.

Hence, the Ministry of Social Affairs emphasizes the necessity of preserving the health and safety of the family. This requires positive change and modification of behaviors and the acquisition of knowledge related to social roles, the safety and health of family members, the importance of committing to establishing a family and mentoring its members, so that they in turn form the nucleus of change for a better society that we aspire to provide equal opportunities, for everyone without any discrimination.

Based on the Ministry's vision for the family and its issues and in order to provide various available means of support aimed at enhancing parental care, and believing in the participatory approach adopted by the Ministry in its intervention in the social field with partners. It's partnership with the ABAAD Organization to develop 'Program Abb' and produce this national training resource for the family, especially spouses, was to provide them with the necessary knowledge and mentor them on how their parental roles can enhance their children's early childhood development.

Because Lebanon is a country that is distinguished and enriched by its diverse fabric, there is no doubt that the process of change and acquiring new knowledge about family issues, parental roles, and positive upbringing can face several challenges at the level of concepts, customs, traditions, some cultural legacies, and stereotypes. This national program, which was reviewed and harmonized, came about to be a flexible, scientific and practical guide that suits the Lebanese cultural environment with all its characteristics and components.

Minister of Social Affairs D. Hector Al Hajjar

In recent years, we've seen significant changes in the roles of men and women in society. While women are increasingly contributing in the workforce and public life, they still spend 2.8 hours more on unpaid housework and caregiving each day compared to men. This imbalance highlights how traditional views of women as primary caregivers continue to impact the perception and roles of men, especially as fathers. It can limit men's involvement in parenting and supporting their partners, perpetuating a cycle where their role in family life is undervalued. This is where 'Program Abb' steps in. It's a program designed to redefine and enhance the role of fathers, making the term 'Abb' (father in Arabic) synonymous with active, caring, and equal parenting.

'Program Abb' is a first-of-its-kind initiative aimed at encouraging fathers to play an active role in caring for their young children. It helps both dads and moms with positive parenting, improving family bonds and promoting fair parenting practices. After many years of successfully implementing it, we've updated this resource to make it even better. Most importantly, this time we've joined hands with the Ministry of Social Affairs, who have adopted this program, allowing us to spread its impact further and help families build strong, healthy relationships.

We hope this resource becomes a valuable tool for organizations, institutions, and individuals alike. By sharing our insights and successes, we aim to inspire others to replicate these positive changes in their own communities. We hope to spread the message of responsible and caring fatherhood, nurturing a more compassionate, equal world for all.

## About Equimundo

Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice (formerly known as Promundo-US) works to achieve gender equality and social justice by transforming intergenerational patterns of harm and promoting patterns of care, empathy, and accountability among boys and men throughout their lives. We believe that working with men and boys to transform harmful gender norms and unequal power dynamics is a critical part of the solution to achieving gender equality. For the empowerment of women and girls to continue advancing, men and boys must see themselves as allies in the process. Men and boys also benefit when harmful norms are challenged.

## About the Ministry of Social Affairs

The Ministry of Social Affairs believes that the success of family relations and the proper formation of a family are the main pillars of society's recovery from social health problems and diseases. As the family forms the first nucleus and the base in the structure of social construction, then should the family be vigorous then the community is likewise, and if it is weak, then the community is likewise too. Thus, the process of developing family relations and promoting positive parenting education would contribute to the development of society as a whole.

Therefore, and based on the tasks of the Ministry of Social Affairs entrusted to it under Law No. 212 of April 2, 1993 (Creation of the Ministry of Social Affairs) 'Caring for family affairs, monitoring population movements and their causes, organizing state efforts and coordinating with the private sector in this regard', the Ministry of Social Affairs launched the National Plan for the Protection of Children and Women in Lebanon in 2015 in partnership with UNICEF and a joint implementation with local and international associations, and as part of its completion of this work. Moreover, building a participatory track and experiences accumulated with ABAAD Association on gender concepts, strengthening family protection services and providing safe spaces, The Ministry of Social Affairs, in partnership with

ABAAD, is pursuing its efforts to launch a program of great value and much needed Program ABBECD which will be implemented for the first time in Lebanon. Program ABB-ECD aims to foster positive parenting and activate parental involvement in early childhood development.

The Ministry of Social Affairs is adopting the program and will work on integrating it into the basket of social services provided by development services centers in various Lebanese territories, and will strive to generalize the concepts related to it within the scope of work of the specialized departments within the ministry.

We hope that Program ABB-ECD will reach its goal which entails preserving our families by promoting parenting and family values   which would preserve the rights and achieve protection and social justice throughout the country.

## Introduction

## Summary

Fathers are very influential for children and for early childhood development. Yet, global statistics speak loud and clear on who mostly cares for children in their first years of life. Even with all the advances towards equality for women over the past 20 years, women around the world still spend, on average, 3 times as much time caring for children and their homes as compared to men and fathers. 1  Of course, many individual men and fathers are, or strive to be, equal caregivers in their homes. And globally, some men and fathers are doing more of the hands-on care of young children. The Program

## About the Partnership

Though Program ABB-ECD is adaptable to almost any context, it was created with Lebanon in mind. Program ABB-ECD is the product of a long-standing partnership between two NGOs, Equimundo and ABAAD, to achieve gender equality in the Middle East and North Africa region. Prior to this collaboration on men's caregiving and early childhood development, these partners worked together with other researchers to carry out the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) in Lebanon. The qualitative and quantitative study findings from IMAGES in Lebanon provided the necessary evidence on how men can be engaged to both empower and lift up women as well as inform programs engaging men to build awareness and promote gender equality in both the public and private spheres. To develop this curriculum, Equimundo and ABAAD together undertook a literature review, formative research with Syrian refugee men and women, and Lebanese men and women, and key informant interviews with Muslim and Christian religious leaders, men who were involved in above-average levels of

P-ECD manual builds upon the original Program P manual developed together with CulturaSalud (Chile), Puntos de Encuentro (Nicaragua), and Instituto Promundo (Brazil) to promote men's involvement in maternal, newborn, and child health. This new chapter on men's caregiving and early childhood development, places a stronger focus on the emotional, physical, and psychological needs of children ages 0-3 and engaging men and their partners in a process of critical reflection about what it means to be a gender-equitable father. We hope you enjoy using this manual!

caregiving, and a development professional working with Syrian refugee children. It was reviewed by an international group of experts in the fields of early childhood development and gender, as well as UN Women.

In Lebanon, social structures / systems and policies influence relations within the family. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the country and the region, including wars, forced displacement, and various crises, have led to an increase in the rate of domestic violence among the host community and the displaced. This has made the urgent need to equip parents with the knowledge and skills necessary to provide safe care and a safe environment for their children, as this knowledge forms the cornerstone of lifelong learning for children.

In this regard and in parallel with Lebanon's plan to respond to the crisis (2017-2020) and the national strategy on protecting children from all forms of violence, exploitation and neglect, approved by the Council of Ministers (2012),

the National Social Development Strategy, and the National Ministry of Social Affairs plan to protect children and women (2014), ABAAD looks forward to working in partnership with the Ministry of Social Affairs in the harmonization and production of a national training resource for engaging fathers in promoting positive parenting and activating parental involvement in early childhood development in Lebanon with a view to adopting it as a program by the Ministry of Social Affairs and implementing it formally in a sustainable way at the national level through the administrative units and their development services centers in cooperation with civil society, institutions, municipalities and other ministries.

In the context of the absence of a unified national guide on promoting positive parenting and activating the participation of parents in early childhood development, ABAAD will share this guide with the Ministry of Social Affairs to benefit from it on a wider basis, noting that ABAAD has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Educational Center for Research and Development (CERD) to integrate all resources developed in partnership with the Ministry of Social Affairs in school curricula / educational activities as this resource is considered an educational pillar in the field of working with parents and prevention and protection issues in Lebanon.

This project, under the supervision of Judge Abdullah Ahmad, Director General of the

## Background

As a result of the landmark study, the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) implemented in the MENA region, we have more insight than ever into men's and women's attitudes and practices related to a range of gender equality issues. One of the largest gender inequalities identified was the gap in unpaid care work. According to the findings, women surveyed carry out the vast majority of the daily care of children and other household

Lebanese Ministry of Affairs, required the formation of a national technical working group composed of an advisory committee represented by members of the Ministry of Social Affairs, with experience in the areas of gender, positive parenting education, early childhood development stage, Family affairs and children's rights, with the aim of reviewing the draft " Program ABB" and collecting responses and impressions in order to make the necessary adjustments in order to produce a national resource that the Ministry of Affairs adopts within its programs.

tasks. Just one-tenth to one-third of men stated that they had recently carried out a more conventionally female task in their home such as cleaning or bathing children. At the same time, there are encouraging trends in which more than 70 percent of men reported going to at least some prenatal visits with a pregnant wife. There are also national level specificities to men's roles as fathers. In times of conflict and war in Lebanon, men play a greater-than-average role

in caregiving due to their inability to play the role of provider or when women are less able to undertake this work because of pregnancy, illness, or injury.

More than two thirds of both men and women believe that fathers spend too little time with the children because of their jobs or the time they spend looking for work (Table 1). A large proportion of respondents also agreed that the father's role in childcare work was mostly as a 'helper'. Participating as a 'helper' was defined as helping someone else who does the majority of childcare. This was significantly higher among Syrian women (p = .01). Perceptions differed between men and women with respect to the role of fathers in caring for the children. Men were mostly seen as the financial providers with 46.5% of Lebanese and 58.7 of Syrian men agreeing with this and 75% of Lebanese women and 94% of Syrian women agreeing that this is the husband's main role as caregiver, highlighting the importance of including women in gender-transformative interventions.

The study also explored the dynamics of violence against women and children. Research found evidence of the intergenerational transmission of violence: men who witnessed their fathers using violence against their mothers, and men who experienced some form of violence at home as children, were significantly more likely to report

Table 1 2

perpetrating intimate partner violence in their adult relationships. There were also high reports of violence perpetrated against children with as many as 50 percent of men and 80 percent of women reporting using some form of physical punishment or other forms of violence against their own children.

These findings highlight the need to engage men as caregivers in programs and with advocacy efforts. Men's involvement as fathers is important for women, whose pathways to empowerment and independence are strengthened when the burden of unpaid care work is shared and when there is more peace in the home. Fathers' involvement is also important for children. According to the State of the World's Fathers 2015 report, fathers are essential for children's emotional and intellectual development. For example, playful and affectionate interactions with their fathers can predict children's positive social-emotional involvement with others, particularly with peers, while harsh discipline by fathers is sometimes associated with later behavioral problems for boys and girls. Similar to the findings on intergenerational transmission of violence, there is also evidence of the intergenerational transmission of caregiving; IMAGES-MENA data has shown that men who were taught to take on unpaid care work as children, and who saw their own fathers participate in traditionally feminine household work, were more likely to do so as fathers in their own families.

Theoretical and Conceptual Framework

## Theory of Change

The concept of 'gender consciousness' that frames Equimundo's programs comes from the idea of critical consciousness developed by Paulo Freire. The process of 'conscientization,' according to Freire, 3  links to individuals' capacity to reflect on the world and to choose a given course of future actions informed and empowered by that critical reflection. This process of reflecting critically on the history of cultural conditions and class structures supporting and framing experiences of gender inequality can help promote personal growth, political awareness, and activism - which can create the conditions to challenge and change gender role prescriptions.

By questioning gender stereotypes, men and women who already act as 'voices of resistance' against rigid gender norms 4  become further engaged and serve as role models for others. The focus on men comes from recognizing the specific gendered experiences and risks and the importance of reaching men when they are developing their attitudes and beliefs about gender norms and power dynamics in relationships. 5

Based on this model, Program P-ECD's overall goal is for men and their partners to learn through questioning and critically reflecting on gender norms, rehearse equitable and

13

nonviolent attitudes and behaviors in a comfortable space, and internalize these new gender attitudes and norms, applying them in their own relationships and lives. The support of institutions and structures, when accompanying this integral group education process, allows the young men and organizations involved to have the tools to become agents of change for gender justice and social justice. Ultimately, this process contributes to achieving two objectives: 6

This contributes to positive outcomes such as decreased intimate partner violence and violence against children, increased couple communication and emotional connectedness, and parents' increased knowledge and support for positive discipline of children.

## What is Gender-Transformative Programming?

Program P-ECD is a gender-transformative program engaging men and their partners in gender equality. Programs integrating a gender and power theoretical framework can be classified depending on the extent to which that integration exists and/or seeks to address rigid gender norms within communities. These programs exist on a spectrum from 'gender-exploitative' (those that reinforce gender stereotypes and inequities) to 'gendertransformative' (those that actively target harmful stereotypes and norms and seek to transform those underlying gender inequalities). In between lies a continuum that also includes 'gender-sensitive' programming - those programs that recognize the specific needs and realities of men and women but do not seek to change or influence gender relations. 9 A literature review conducted by the World

Health Organization on gender-related programs confirmed that those interventions that applied a gender-transformative approach were more likely to lead to changes in the attitudes of men and boys than those that did not. 10

Programs that can be categorized as 'gendertransformative' move beyond the individual level to also address the interpersonal, sociocultural, structural, and community factors that influence gender-related attitudes and behaviors. 11  Individual attitude and behavior change does not happen in isolation; larger social, political, and economic forces drive change at both the societal and individual levels around gender relations, gender power relations, and masculinities. For this reason, gender-transformative approaches must aim to effect change at multiple levels of society.

## The Effect of Working with Parents on Society:

Responsive parenting is an entry point for inclusive community development.

In other words, they must take an ecological approach to transforming gender norms. 12  (See the figure 'Socio-Ecological Model.')

## A Focus on Early Childhood Development

It's clear that that fathers' positive involvement in caregiving is associated with children's emotional and social well-being and cognitive development (LAB, 2004; Cabrera and Tamis-Lemonda, 2013). However, there are few parenting programs that intentionally engage fathers as equal caregivers to mothers. The Program P-ECD manual is an approach to shift the gender norms that serve as obstacles to men being equally involved, loving caregivers alongside their partners and other members of their family. It focuses specifically on recognizing the social and emotional development of their children and provides concrete skills to give praise and utilize non-violent discipline techniques.

## Socio-Ecological Model

The socio-ecological model helps visualize multiple entry points to challenge harmful gender norms at the individual, relational, societal, social, or other broader structural levels - as gender norms are learned, absorbed, reproduced, and strengthened. Ideally, Program ABB should be implemented alongside strategies aimed at educating the larger community and basic institutions about gender transformation and the importance of engaging men.

With regard to supporting influences and structures, it is essential to recognize the various ways that supportive environments for change can be created. The following figure, adapted from the socio-ecological model, shows how several components of the Program P-ECD intervention can be combined to create more sustainable change. The socio-ecological model helps envision the many entry points for challenging harmful gender norms at the individual, relational, community, and societal or broader structural levels - in which gender norms are learned, internalized, reproduced, and reinforced. Ideally, Program P-ECD should be implemented in conjunction with strategies to sensitize the larger community and key institutions on gender transformation and the importance of male engagement.

## Socio-Ecological Model

In programming focused on shifting gender norms, there must be connections among the interventions implemented at these different levels. For example, Equimundo has found that group education interventions at the individual and relational levels are often more effective when combined with community campaigns that promote new perceptions of men's caregiving and validate changes in men's behaviors and attitudes.

Defining Program P-ECD 02

## What is Program P-ECD?

Based on the vision of ABAAD and its working strategies aiming at reducing violence against women and girls in the MENA region, and in the absence of training tools that are sensitive and adapted according to the local culture and context in the Arabic language on positive parenting, ABAAD and Equimundo initiated to develop this awareness guide entitled Program P-ECD - Promoting Positive Parenting and Strengthening Active Father's Involvement in Early Childhood Development.

Program P-ECD focuses specifically on the component of promoting positive parenting and activating parent participation in early childhood and newborn development up to eight years of age, in terms of intellectual, emotional, physical, and psychological needs. The program also focuses on engaging parents to improve family relationships by providing positive parenting techniques. This program contains thirteen basic group educational sessions and two additional sessions on life experiences applied with caregivers, parents, as well as, tips for the facilitator and background information before starting any of the suggested sessions.

<!-- image -->

## Who is Program ABB for?

Program P-ECD is designed to be used by social workers and others who provide social and health services, with the aim of empowering local communities to ensure the sustainability of integrated care for every child during early childhood through safe and sound parenting educational practices to build healthy societies that respect human rights and human dignity, and to spread knowledge about gender and gender equality, that is, equity and fairness in the distribution of opportunities, responsibilities and benefits available to men and women.

## How to use the Program P-ECD Manual

## Program P-ECD as part of an integrated program

Program P-ECD builds upon an existing evidence-based approached called Program P for Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health, by focusing more on the specificities of promoting early childhood development from a gender and masculinities perspective. We recommend using the group education activities in this manual as part of an integrated program for male caregivers and their partners. Evidence from international settings has shown that group education activities alone cannot promote attitude and behavioral changes. It has been found that when these education sessions are complemented by youth-led campaigns, activism, and other community actions, the effects can be greater and more long-lasting. Furthermore, an integrated approach is important to sustaining attitude and behavioral changes over time at the community level and beyond. See our theory of change and the socio-ecological model in the following subsections for more information.

Each session contains a series of activities lasting from 1 to 2 hours. Pilot studies have shown that both men and women would like more time, rather than less, to discuss the issues in each topic. Consider consulting with participants as to how to accommodate more time for discussions if time is limited. The group education sessions

## Who can be a facilitator?

A facilitator is not a teacher or instructor. He or she is not necessarily a content 'expert,' though expertise is important. She or he is someone who can create a safe environment, someone should be delivered in the order as it is structured in this manual. The sessions have all been tested with men and couples, though they must be adapted to each context and audience and implemented alongside additional activities.

A fully integrated Program P-ECD approach means complementing activities with campaigns, activism, workplace training, leadership opportunities, and advocacy. Implementers of Program P-ECD are also highly encouraged to make appropriate connections to assist providers and other professionals who are part of the parents' lives and influence their socialization. For example, facilitators might refer couples to counseling, a victim service advocate, a health service provider for antenatal or postnatal services. Referrals and other connections will depend on both the needs of the group and the goals of the program. Ideally, service providers, leaders, and participants will endorse Program P-ECD, carrying it out as part of an existing menu of services. This will reinforce the genderequitable messages far beyond a program led by the facilitator. Additionally, under ideal circumstances, Program P-ECD should be connected to an organization's advocacy efforts to influence gender-equitable public policies at the appropriate levels.

who is a good listener, someone who wants to encourage discussion more than hear himself or herself speak.

That being said, many of the activities that are included in this manual touch on parents' personal qualities and sensitive life experiences. Therefore, groups should be led by facilitators who are comfortable working with these issues, have experience in working with parents, and have the support of their organizations and/or other professionals. Facilitators have a responsibility to create an open and respectful environment: an environment in which parents can feel comfortable enough to share and learn from their own experiences and challenge longheld beliefs about parenting, fatherhood, gender and masculinity. The facilitator must also have the skills to handle conflicts that may arise.

It is critical that the facilitator has a solid foundation of the concept of 'gender' as well as of the different social and health issues to be addressed during the sessions. As part of their training and prior to facilitating Program P-ECD sessions, facilitators must also go through a process of self-reflection about their own experiences and concerns with regard to gender, masculinity, and parenting. This will allow the facilitator to discuss these issues in a calm and open manner. As such, a training of facilitators is essential to provide the future facilitators with the set of skills necessary, as well as space to explore the different concepts that will be discussed.

21

Similarly, facilitators should be sensitive and responsive to the participants. The facilitator should be alert to the possibility that participants may require specific attention apart from the group and, in some cases, may require referral to professional services and guidance counseling.

Is it advisable to use male facilitators when working with groups of men? In some contexts, men prefer to interact with a male facilitator who will listen and, at the same time, serve as a model. However, other evidence suggests that the quality of the facilitator - the ability to mobilize the group, listen and motivate them - is a more important factor than sex. One recommended possibility is to have both male and female facilitators working as a team to show that it is possible to work together, and to model equality and respect. Nevertheless, it is not always possible to have more than one facilitator, or to form a collaborative pairing, thus it is advisable to train as many qualified facilitators as possible who are willing, available, and motivated to lead a group process.

## The role of the facilitator

You have an important role to play as a facilitator. Ask questions to better understand the participants and help them to reflect more. Remember: you are not a parent or a gender expert. You do not need to have all the answers. The role of the facilitator is to create an open and respectful environment in which men can feel comfortable sharing and learning from one another.

Remember, changing attitudes and behaviors is a long process. Participation in these activities will not necessarily lead to an immediate transformation of men's lives and relationships. It is the beginning of a process for promoting personal change.

Many of the themes are complex and sensitive. You need to pay attention to the comfort level of the participants. In some cases, you may need to refer individuals to professional services or counseling. It is important to be sensitive to the practical realities of the group members' lives. It is important to understand that they may face challenges or dangers when trying to make changes.

See your group as a process, in that members of the group engage together in discussions, group work, and decision making. Ask 'process questions,' or questions that encourage participants to reflect more. These are questions that cannot be answered with a 'yes' or 'no' and that are not biased towards one participant against others.

## Tips for successful facilitation 13

## Create a safe and equal space:

It is important for the group to be in a space where participants feel safe and comfortable. The facilitator(s) and the participants should sit in a circle during the discussions to encourage exchange and equality.

## Enforce the group agreement:

Ask participants to establish a group agreement (commonly known as 'ground rules') and enforce them throughout the activities. Important aspects of a group agreement include listening to and showing respect for others (not talking when others are speaking, not making rude comments or talking on the phone); confidentiality; and participation. It is beneficial that these are written up on a flip chart paper in the first session, and hung up during every session.

## Do not judge:

Remember: you are here to facilitate discussion and reflection. Your role is not to teach or punish anyone. Be friendly and create rapport with your participants. Be aware of your own position of power - avoid judgmental and authoritarian attitudes. Never impose your feelings or opinions on the group.

## Promote inclusion:

Ensure that all participants have the opportunity to speak. Be careful not to let one person dominate the conversation or make other people feel that they cannot share their own opinions.

## Address participants' concerns:

As a facilitator, you can engage the larger group in helping to propose solutions to the problems that individuals are facing. Ask the group, 'How do you think this problem could be solved?' or 'Has anyone faced a similar situation? What did you do?'

## Know and use referral services:

Some participants may prefer to discuss a particular topic, obtain information, or seek support outside of a group setting, or may need attention from a specialized service provider. As a facilitator, you should be knowledgeable of resources to which you can refer participants, if necessary. It could be beneficial, if possible, to prepare a sheet that includes all the referral numbers in your community, and to provide it to the beneficiaries during the first session.

## Manage conflicts respectfully:

If a conflict arises among the group members, or if a participant shares a discriminatory view, remind the participants of the group agreement and keep it visible during the session. Also, encourage other members to help mediate the situation. Ask the group what they think about the question raised or how they would suggest handling the problem. When necessary, you can offer brief responses to questions to clarify misunderstandings.

## Appreciate honesty and openness:

Encourage participants to be honest and open. They should not be afraid to discuss sensitive issues for fear of ridicule from their peers. Thank the group members for sharing their personal stories. Never force anyone to participate in the activities.

23

## Promote movement and interaction:

Include as much physical movement as possible so that participants remain active, alert, and interested. Use short energizer activities, such as songs or dances, in between activities in order to keep the participants engaged in the topics you are discussing.

## Manage your time:

Keep track of time. Keep in mind participants' attention spans and schedules.

## Pick an appropriate number of participants:

In order to ensure that the group is a safe and equal space, the number of participants should not be more than 15. Seven is ideal for everyone to have time to share and be heard. Smaller groups are also okay.

## Focus on the participants who are present:

If some participants do not show up, remind yourself to focus on the ones coming and not on the ones who are absent. Even if only one participant arrives, focus on him and remind yourself that a good conversation with him about his life and relationships might mean a lot to him and his family. He might also recommend the next meeting to his friends.

## Meet the participants' pace:

This may be the first time that participants hear of or think about some of the sensitive topics discussed. Start at a slow pace. This will help participants to become familiar with the topics and to build trust in the group.

## Understand sensitive topics:

Many of the discussions include sensitive topics. Feel free to include case studies and examples from outside the region, if helpful, to destigmatize the issue.

## Stay on track:

While all discussions are welcomed, be sure to have a rule that can 'bank' or 'park' discussions that lead you off the topic. Write 'Bank' or 'Parking Lot' on a sheet of paper and put it in a visible place in the room. Write down issues that veer off topic that the group can return to at a later time. If there is a feeling that a topic may be triggering other participants or creating undue harm, you can use this opportunity to 'bank' or 'park' that discussion as well.

## Model equitable relationships:

If co-facilitating in a pair, be sure that you and your co-facilitator are modeling an equitable relationship. For instance, give each other equal shares of the sessions to lead, and make sure that one facilitator is not leading all of the discussions while the other only takes notes.

## How and where to hold groups

The duration of a group education program can range from a single discussion group to ongoing weekly sessions. The practice of conducting several sessions, with a brief rest period of a few days to a week between each session, seems to be the most effective. This hiatus allows participants time to reflect on and apply the topics discussed in real life scenarios, and then return to the group and continue the dialogue.

One study has shown that group education sessions lasting two or two-and-a-half hours per week, for a period of 10 to 16 weeks, is the most effective "dose" with respect to sustained attitude and behavior change. 14  Other studies have shown an impact in terms of changing attitudes in just 2-6 sessions. We believe that a greater number of sessions allows for more effective acceptance of the issues, and provides more time during the week and between sessions to reflect on the issues and discuss them with partners, all of which increases the likelihood of producing favorable results. This curriculum consists of 13 sessions each ranging from one to two hours. There are also several supplementary sessions to include if time permits.

Groups of 5 to 15 participants are recommended. If classes are inclusive of couples, a minimum of 4 couples and a maximum of 10 should be invited to participate. The creation of the groups will depend on the context in which the activities are implemented and on the particular characteristics of the participants. Working with large groups is not recommended, because the size can make it very difficult to conduct the sessions and to achieve learning objectives in a confidential, intimate and mutually supportive atmosphere.

This curriculum was developed for Lebanese and Syrian families in Lebanon with children between the ages of 0 and 3, but the composition of each group may vary. The facilitator should know the demographics of the group beforehand in order to be aware and thoughtful about the different experiences and challenges pertaining to your participants' experiences as parents and families. In particular, be aware of your participants' literacy level and adapt the exercises accordingly.

## Recruitment Strategies

Programs that attempt to transform gender norms require a focus on men as well as women. The process of transformation should be one where men are equally engaged.

1. Using a 'Gender without the G word' approach facilitates the recruitment of men and decreases the resistance that we might face while working with men on topics related to masculinities and gender. The strength of this strategy is that it does not focus on gender in an obvious manner, but rather conveys the key messages in an implicit manner. This strategy is usually focused on stress and anger management, yet can be on any topic where there are gender-considerations. In the case of this program, recruitment messaging can be framed around family and parenting. To find out more about this strategy, please refer to the manual 'Practical Guidelines on Engaging Men against Gender-Based Violence for the Promotion of Gender Equality' 15  developed by ABAAD and the Danish Refugee Council (DRC).

Working through the Women and Girls Safe Spaces (WGSS) program operating in the Social Development Centers across Lebanon:

- ABAAD always conducts sensitization sessions for community members during which men can be referred to the different existing services provided by the Centers.
- Through the women that are already participating in WGSS programs: husbands may already be seeing positive changes in their wives through their participation in women-only programs, which may encourage the husbands to attend different programs addressed to them.
2. Utilizing programs, centers and locations that provide existing services for men and women:
- Men's Centers provide psychosocial support

services for men with abusive behaviors as well as for couples seeking support.

- Through training for community members on masculinities and gender concepts, we aim to have community awareness interventions addressed to men that in many cases encourage them to ask about ABAAD services and benefit from them.
- National or community campaigns on gender, GBV, fatherhood and child protection could encourage men to know more about the organization's services and to take part of the programs addressed to them. For example, every year during the International 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, ABAAD launches a series of informative advocacy campaigns aimed at the sensitization of the public opinion on existing laws, social rights and support systems.
- Official institutions (ministries, municipalities, clubs…) could create a great space and opportunity to recruit men. For example, MOSA through partnership with ABAAD will be officially implementing Program P-ECD on the national level through the different SDCs and ministry units.
3. Mobilizing and strengthening networks, partnerships, informal community groups and gatherings, cluster referral systems, youth associations, FBOs, support groups, educational institutions and daycares/parentteacher associations etc

Despite these recommendations for the recruitment of men and boys, the role of the implementing organization or facilitator is of outmost importance as they will have a better and more intimate understanding of the context, cultural norms, and participants. The implementer should choose the most appropriate strategy from those given above or they might choose an entirely different strategy based upon their knowledge of the community.

## Icebreakers and energizers

Icebreakers and energizers are intended to introduce more energy into the group when you have been discussing particularly sensitive issues for an extended amount of time. They are also meant to be fun and promote concentration. It is generally recommended to use energizers after coming back from breaks or in between activities. Ask others in your group to create their own energizers. Ensure that icebreakers are culturally sensitive. For example, do not lead an icebreaker that involves touching if touching between men and women is inappropriate.

## Ha, Ha

Begin by having all the players sit in a circle. Tell all of the players they have to remain as solemn and serious as they can throughout the game. Pick one player to start the game, saying 'Ha' once. The player standing next to him says the word 'Ha' twice. Following this pattern, the third player says 'Ha' three times. As the game progresses, eliminate any players who laugh or make noise when it is not their turn. The player who avoids laughing throughout the game wins.

## Get in Motion

Ask group members to stand. Ask them to shake their right arm, then their left arm, then their right leg and then their left leg. Now, tell participants that you will count to 10 while they shake each limb. They will shake their right arm 10 times, then their left arm 10 times, followed by their right leg 10 times, and their left leg 10 times - you can count out loud for each one (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)! As soon as participants have shaken each limb 10 times, go through the cycle again, but only count to 9. Proceed, counting to 8, then 7, then 6, then 5 and so on until participants only shake each limb once. To make the energizer more exciting, you can count faster and faster as you go.

## The Rainstorm

Ask the group to stand in a circle with their eyes closed. Say that a rainstorm is approaching. Ask everyone to rub their palms against their pant legs. Then ask them to lightly pat their thighs with their fingertips. Ask them to do it harder. Now, ask them to pat their hands against their thighs. Now start slapping your hands faster and faster against your thighs. After a while, go back to lighter slapping, then patting, etc., to reverse the whole order until it is quiet again and the storm has passed. [At first the wind was blowing the trees, then light rain started, then heavier rain, then a downpour, and then the whole thing faded away.]

## The Spaghetti

The group forms a tight circle. Everyone sticks their hands into the center. With one hand, everyone grabs the hand of another person. Then, using the other hand, they each grab a hand of someone different. The object of the game is to get untangled without letting go. By climbing, crawling, and wriggling around, participants can create one large open circle or, sometimes, two unconnected ones. If they are totally stuck, you can tell them they can choose to undo one link, and then reconnect once that person has turned around, and see if that works. This energizer is fun and creates a nice physical bond between participants. It also subtly communicates ideas of working together to accomplish a task.

## The Shrinking Iceberg

Put a blanket or several sheets of newspaper on the floor. Ask the group to stand on it. Then explain that this is an iceberg that is melting away, reducing its size by half every month. Their object is to see how long they can all stay on it. You ask

them to get off it and fold the blanket in half or remove half the paper. Each time, reduce the area by half and see how they can find ways to support each other to allow everyone to stay on.

## Exercising

More basic than the others. Ask someone to lead the group in some simple stretching.

## Annex I: Considerations when working with displaced and other special populations

Since the eruption of civil war in Syria in 2011, more than five million refugees have fled the country. One million Syrian refugees are in Lebanon, making Lebanon the country with the highest per capita proportion of refugees in the world.

As anti-refugee sentiment has grown in Lebanon, the government has enacted policies to discourage refugees from entering and from remaining in Lebanon. In January 2015, the Lebanese government introduced visa restrictions that require entrants to fulfil certain criteria that are nearly impossible to meet. Seeking refuge from the Syrian civil war is not among the valid reasons for entry, other than exceptional circumstances approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs. Additionally, Lebanon ordered the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to stop registering new cases - effectively cutting off aid to new arrivals - and has prohibited international organizations from establishing formal refugee camps. Syrians therefore live in a variety of settings, including apartments, informal camps, abandoned buildings, and repurposed storefronts. They are often forced to relocate among these options, and often several times, making it difficult to deliver aid systematically.

It is under these circumstances that Syrian refugees in Lebanon are mothers, fathers, and children. In 2016, UNICEF estimated that 306,000 Syrian children had been born as refugees since the start of the war in 2011 - a number that continues to grow - and half of all refugees are children. These children's lives are shaped by the violence that they and their parents have experienced. Children experience their own psychological stress and trauma as a result of the crisis and are also affected by the psychological trauma of their parents. Given that the first three years of life contain the most rapid period of brain development, it is important to provide a safe, nurturing environment for children in these early years and to equip parents and caretakers with the necessary knowledge and skills to lay the foundation for their children's lifelong learning, abilities, and outcomes.

Men and women's relationships with each other and with their children may be shifting due to their experiences in Syria and in Lebanon. It is the intent of this curriculum to fully transform gender norms in order to promote men's involvement as equitable, nonviolent caregivers to achieve family well-being, gender equality, and better health for mothers, fathers, and children.

Additional considerations should be recognized if working with other special populations. Seating arrangements, communication methods, visual and audio aids, group work, role plays, and all other activities must be structured in ways that are inclusive of participants with disabilities. In general, ensure that everyone is included in the learning process by anticipating and eliminating potential barriers.

- Put chairs (if they are available) in a round circle (no table in the middle) so that everyone can see each other. If chairs are not available, have everyone sit on the floor in a circle. This layout helps set the tone that this is an equal and nonauthoritarian setting.
- Write on the flip chart paper in colorful markers: WELCOME!
- On a separate flip chart paper write the following headings: (1) Name, (2) Partner's name, (3) Child(ren)'s name(s) and age(s) (4) Something you love to do together and (5) Something you would like to do more

If possible (not essential): Prepare a table near the entrance with something to drink (water/ tea or coffee and if possible some simple cookies. If this is not possible, find other ways to create an atmosphere where participants can feel welcome, relax and mingle informally with you and with each other as they arrive.

## Create the Safe Space

Remember to review the 'Tips for Successful Facilitation' before you start. In addition, the following guidelines are recommended for the first activity:

- Use a 'talking tool' and pass it around in your discussions to make it clear who has the floor;
- Tell the participants:
- When you share, use 'I' statements to ensure you are only speaking for yourself

rather than for others;

- Listen attentively. You can do this by leaning forward and looking into the eyes of the person sharing;
- Avoid asking questions or making comments when one person is sharing. By listening attentively, you are providing space for the person to feel really listened to and supported in deepening his/ her reflections.  Listening to others can allow you to think of things in a new light. Sharing one's new insight can be useful for everyone. To listen is a gift that can help the person sharing explore ideas and concepts that are new to them;
- Decide on a time limit for sharing (e.g., 2 min.) Use a timer, if needed.

In general, just be yourself. You are not a 'parent expert.' You do not need to have all the answers. The role of the facilitator is to create an open and respectful environment in which men can feel comfortable sharing and learning from each other.

## Special considerations for working with displaced populations:

The massive influx of Syrian refugees into Lebanon has led to increased examination on the impact of the conflict on men's and women's roles, as well as its impact on women's rights. Research shows that as a result of the conflict, men and women's relationships with each other and their children, as well as their gender identities and roles, may shift and become challenged as they become unable to fulfill society's expectations. One qualitative

study cited one Syrian man as saying, 'A man who cannot fulfill his role as a provider loses his value to society,' and a Syrian woman as saying, 'Even children stop answering to their fathers. They no longer consider them authority figures. Men cannot control their families.' 16

Here are a few recommendations to keep in mind as you start this first session:

- Be aware of the assumptions you may have about the groups with which you engage. This means taking time to read the latest literature about refugee experiences, and speaking with practitioners and experts. In the process, work with others to examine your own prejudices and challenge yourself to be open, empathetic, and understanding of the unique challenges that refugees are facing in their everyday lives.
- In practice, this may imply having to modify certain sessions in order to meet men and their partners where they are. If possible do so prior to the session, ascertain literacy levels of each group in order to modify activities as appropriate.
- One of the principal goals of this program is for men to deconstruct harmful versions of masculinity that contribute to men's use of violence against others, their absence from caregiving and domestic chores, and other issues. Through this same lens, facilitators must also recognize the trauma that men, themselves, have also experienced as a result of the ongoing conflict - how conflict has torn at the fabric of their identities. At its most basic level, this means actively listening, and creating a safe space where men and their partners can feel supported to share their challenges as it relates to the objectives of your session.
- At the same time, this is not meant to be a group counseling or therapy session. To that end, be sure to have on hand appropriate

referrals to services where men can go to cope with their traumatic experiences and perceived loss of manhood in constructive and non-violent ways. According to recent research on men and masculinities conducted in Lebanon, Syrian men are more likely to report depressive symptoms. Whether or not men ask for this type of assistance, be sure to include this as a resource either at the beginning of this session or during a later session. ABAAD Men's Counseling Center offers free services to men for this purpose. Women can benefit from ABAAD's model Centers for Holistic Care for women and Girls (IMKAN). With the overall aim to protect vulnerable women and girls from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, including GBV, the Model Centers provide holistic care (case management, legal consultations and court representation, psychotherapy, psychiatric evaluation and follow up, as well as CMR services). It also offers, when needed, referral to ABAAD's emergency safe housing (Al Dar), as well soft skills/economic empowerment as needed for women and girl survivors of GBV and their children.

## Session 1: Welcome Session

## Purpose:

-  To welcome participants to the group and allow everyone to get to know each other
-  To establish a safe group environment where everyone feels listened to and respected
-  To reflect on the people who have relationships with our children and their impact

For Couples

## Key Activities and Time: 1 hour

1. Welcome - 10 minutes
2. Group Agreement - 10 minutes
3. Who Supports Our Child? - 35 minutes
4. Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- Flip chart paper and markers
- Pieces of paper and pens
- If possible (not essential) cups and something to drink (water/tea or coffee) and some simple cookies
- A 'talking tool' - preferably a soft object, a ball, a small soft animal or something else that you can hold in one hand. In some countries, they use a soft animal and call it 'the little friend.'
- What would be a good 'talking tool' and name in your context?

## Planning Notes:

This is the first session you will conduct with your group. It is important to set a warm and inviting tone so that everyone feels at ease to express themselves during today's session. To save time, prepare the room beforehand. It is preferable that participants sit in a circle. If the group takes place in a room with chairs and tables, push desks or other tables against the wall (or put outside the room) and place a circle of chairs in the center of the room. If there are no chairs, have participants sit on the floor in a circle.

If possible, bring men and their partners together for the welcome and the group agreement sections of this session. By including the women in these important introductory activities, the group will have their valuable input and they will be acclimated to the group before they join in later sessions.

## Procedure:

## Registration (15 minutes)

## Welcome (10 minutes)

1. Meet each participant at the door and greet him in a warm and culturally respectful manner. For example, this could be by looking him in the eyes and shaking his hand. This shows respect and it also gives the facilitator a feeling of the participant's mood on that particular day.
2. Introduce yourself and ask their name. If possible, offer them something to drink/eat.
3. Let participants introduce themselves to each other and take your time to mingle with them informally while you are waiting for all of the participants to arrive. Talk about the weather or anything else that can create a normal relaxed social atmosphere.
4. If participants already know each other, make a note of this, as there may be particular dynamics around creating the safe space. For

example, if implementing in small community or settlement you may have a father and son in the same group.

## What would you as the facilitator feel comfortable to ask? What is normal in your context to ask about when meeting others for the first time in an informal setting?

If it feels appropriate, you can ask questions such as: How did you hear about this meeting? What made you want to come? Do any of you already know each other?

Notes:

5. Once it is time to start, welcome everyone to take a seat in the circle (some or all may already be seated).

## Suggested statement when seated together in the circle:

'Welcome to the group and thank you for coming! You were invited to this group because [fill in reason here]. In this session, we will discuss how men and women can work together as supportive and respectful partners and parents together and promote a more peaceful household.'

6. Set the tone of the group by discussing why this group is important to you. Show that the space is safe by sharing something personal and important. It can, for example, be a challenge that you have had as a father, e.g., you found yourself dividing household roles unequally with your partner that you would like to change. Share why you would like to overcome the challenge.

## Example:

For me, this group is important because I found that I was not well prepared for what it means to live and cooperate well with a partner in a relationship. I was trained to be a real man, always strong. Instead of communicating in an open and honest way, I tend to turn silent. When we married, my partner and I had the intention to support each other, but when we became parents, I found myself frustrated and under pressure all the time to provide material things for my children. It made me feel empty and sad. Because of this, I sometimes work even harder in order to try to fill that emptiness with work - and the negative spiral is dragging me and my family down.

## What personal story would you feel comfortable sharing?

Notes:

7. Next, tell the group that your role as the facilitator is to support the group and encourage everyone to talk and share, and to ensure that it is safe to do so.
8. Ask participants if they would like to say anything about why they came to this group. Take no more than a couple volunteers.
9. Explain that we will use different exercises and methods for active participation.
10. Introduce the 'talking tool' [use the chosen name for it] (optional).

## Suggested statement:

This is a talking tool. It is one of the tools that we will use to help us share and to listen to each other. When you hold it, you have the word and we all listen to you. We will pass it around in the circle so that everybody can talk. I will also keep track of time so everybody has equal time.

When you receive the tool, you are invited to talk, but it is also OK to pass it on to the next person if you prefer not to share anything right then. You will get it back again later.

11. Open the flip chart to the list of topics you wrote before the start of the session.
12. Say, 'Even though many of us have already met each other, it is good to introduce ourselves again.'
13. Each participant will share: 1) Their name, (2) Partner's name, (3) Child(ren)'s name(s) and age(s), (4) Something you love to do together as a family and (5) Something you would like to do more of as a family.
14. As the facilitator, you should start.
15. Tell participants that you will use a timer to ensure that everyone has at least 2 minutes to share.
16. After you have finished sharing, pass the 'Talking tool' to the next person.
17. Once it has gone around the entire circle say, 'Thank you for sharing!'
18. If the sharing in the first round was rich and the group process feels safe: Ask them to turn to their neighbor and reflect, in pairs, for 3 minutes on what it was like to do this round of introduction. Then ask them to turn back to the group and share some of the stated reflection

## Key Message:

Creating a safe space will provide a means to identify challenges and solutions that you each face as fathers. It feels good to share personal reflections because it allows you to see that you are not alone in your struggles.

## Group Agreement (10 minutes)

19. Explain to the group that in this activity, the group will make a group agreement that will promote a safe space where they can find honesty, trust, and support.
20. Ask the group, 'What agreements would help you to feel safe and comfortable to discuss and share in this group?'

Note to the facilitator: You should write down the list of agreements on a flip chart. Remember that these need to be visible in every session. In the box below is a list of several recommended agreements. If these are not mentioned first by the group members, recommend that they be included.

## Important Group Agreements for a Successful Group

## Privacy and Confidentiality:

- Personal experiences must be kept private. No one should discuss the private information shared in the group with others in the community, if someone does not want it to be shared.

## Equality:

- All members of the group are equal, irrespective of age, gender or background. All members have a voice and the right to speak, share and contribute.

## Respect and Empathy:

- Speak one at a time. Allow each person the time to speak. Everyone's viewpoint is important. We need to make sure that everyone is heard. Listen and show interest in what others have to say.
- Practice empathy - Imagine yourself in the other person's position and try to understand how they feel. Respect the opinions of others and try not to judge others for their experiences or opinions.
- Every member should actively participate and contribute to the group. Use only 'I believe, I think, or I have experienced' statements. Do not assume that your viewpoint is shared with everyone else in the group.
21. After a list of agreements is created, ask: 'Is there anything missing which you would like to add?'
22. Make any additions to the flip chart list that are suggested.
23. After the list is complete, ask each group member: 'Does everyone agree to this list and commit to upholding these agreements during our sessions?'

Note to the Facilitator: If someone does not want to commit, ask him or her why. Ask the group: 'Are there alternative agreements that you would feel more comfortable with?' Suggest that the agreement be changed or removed, depending on the desires of the group.

24. After everyone has agreed to the group agreement, explain that these agreements will remain in place for the duration of the group sessions and need to be followed in order for everyone to feel comfortable, safe and respected.

## Key Message:

Establishing a group agreement will help this meeting to be a space where men can find honesty, trust and support.

## Who Supports Our Child? (35 minutes)

25. Explain that in these groups, it is important to think about all the people who influence us and the way we care for our children. Ask them, 'Besides us as mothers and fathers, who else helps raise our children?'
26. Draw nested circles on flipchart paper to worksheet at the end of this activity.

resemble the 'My Child's Support Circles' If you have paper, pass out blank sheets and pens so that participants can draw the circles themselves.

27. Tell the participants to write their child(ren)'s name or draw their figures in the middle of the center circle.
28. In the circles closest to the center, they should draw (or write) the names of the people who have the most interaction and/ or closest relationships with their child(ren). For example: mother, father, grandparents, anyone who lives in the household.
29. In the outer circles, they should draw or write the names of the people who have less interaction with the child(ren). For example: other family members, teachers, religious leaders, other community members.
30. Give the participants 10 minutes to draw or write about their child's circles. After 10 minutes, ask if any of the participants would like to share their child's network with the group.
31. After some individuals have shared, open the discussion using the questions below:
- Was it easy or difficult to identify the people who interact with your child(ren)? Were there any surprises?

38

- In what ways do these individuals influence your child(ren)?
- Are there any individuals in your child(ren)'s circles who support you in your parenting?
- Are there any individuals in your child's circles who are less supportive or contradict the messages you give your child(ren)? How do they do so? If possible, how do you resolve any challenges between you?

## Key Message:

There are many people other than ourselves as parents who influence our children. As we learn new parenting techniques in the coming weeks, we need to keep these individuals in mind.

## Close (5 minutes)

## My Child's Network

<!-- image -->

- Using the Key Messages, thank all participants for sharing their questions, concerns and experiences.
- Express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session, and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
- Explain that you will use all questions posed in these activities to further inform and shape the coming sessions.
- Remind the group about confidentiality, and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.

At the end of each session, explain that the participants will be assigned a task that will be reviewed during the next session. For this session, ask participants to reflect on the group agreement and come to the next session prepared to respect the items on the list.

## Session 2: Building Our Group

## Purpose:

-  To continue to allow participants to get to know each other and build trust
-  To receive feedback on the needs, expectations and motivations of participants

For Men only

## Key Activities and Time: 1 hour

1. Check-in - 5 minutes
2. Trusting Each Other - 20 minutes
3. My Needs and Concerns as a Father - 30 minutes
4. Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- Optional: flip chart and markers

## Planning Notes:

## Procedure:

## Check-in (5 minutes)

1. Welcome and thank all of the participants for coming to the session.
2. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:
- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

## Trusting Each Other (20 minutes) 17

1. Explain to the group that in this activity they

will do an exercise to help them build trust and to reflect on their responsibilities towards each other.

2. Divide participants into pairs. Explain that in each pair, one person will be the 'guide' and the other person will be the 'follower.' The 'guide' will lead the 'follower' around the room. Explain the steps below:
- The 'follower' will keep his eyes closed.
- The 'guide' should ask the 'follower' how he likes to be guided and supported.
- The 'guide' should ensure that the other person feels safe (for example, no jokes, no clashes with others).
- The 'follower' should indicate what he needs in order to feel supported and guided, and what will help him to trust his 'guide.'

Note to the Facilitator: It may be necessary to demonstrate this activity before the participants do it. Ask a volunteer to help by being your 'follower' and spend a few seconds showing the group an example of 'guiding' him. For example, direct your volunteer 'follower' to close their eyes and then jump up and down on one foot.

3. Remind the participants of the ground rules and the importance of listening to and respecting the needs of the others. Each guide has a responsibility to take care of their follower and to respond to their needs.
4. Share with the group some suggestions for guided support (it may be helpful for you to demonstrate these behaviors with a volunteer).

Program ABB -

- Walking hand in hand.
- Putting your arms around the shoulders of the follower.
- Standing behind the follower.
5. After providing the instructions, ask the 'guides' to begin leading their 'followers' around the room. Allow 2-3 minutes for the guides to lead.
6. After 2-3 minutes, ask everyone to stop and tell the 'followers' to open their eyes. Explain to the group that the pairs will now switch roles.
- The 'guides' are now the 'followers.'
- The 'followers' are now the 'guides.'
7. Give the pairs 2-3 minutes in their new roles.
8. After 2-3 minutes, ask everyone to stop and tell the 'followers' to open their eyes. Ask everyone to come back to the circle and start
- a discussion using the questions below:
- When you were 'followers':
- How did it feel to be led by the other person?
- Was it easy to trust the person guiding you?
- What are some things that made you feel safe and trust your guide?
- When you were 'guides':
- How did it feel to lead the other person?
- Did you feel a sense of responsibility to the other person?
- How did you take responsibility?
- Which role was easiest? Which role was hardest?
- How did it feel to work together in this activity?

## My Needs and Concerns as a Father (30 minutes)

9. Divide the participants into groups of 3 or 4 people and ask them: 'What would you like to reflect on, learn, share or understand in these sessions together?' Tell them they have five to ten minutes in their groups for this discussion.

Note to the Facilitator: Depending on the demographics of the group, the participants' needs and fears may vary. For instance, Syrian refugee fathers may worry about how discrimination and legal status in Lebanon affects their ability to be a good father, while Lebanese fathers have other, equally valid concerns. Be sure you know the demographics of your group ahead of time so you can be prepared for the different concerns they may have.

10. After the five to ten minutes are up, ask for a volunteer from each group to report back one to two questions or comments from the group.

Note to the Facilitator: If participants only mention sons when discussing their children, ask them why this is so. Discussions of gender and treating sons and daughters equally will come in later sessions, but it is important to ensure that men start thinking that their caregiving role is of equal importance for both their sons and their daughters.

11. Record the comments and questions on a chalkboard or flip chart paper.
12. Once all groups have had a chance to report back, read the first question and answer it, modeling the behavior for the group (using 'I' statements, validating that it is a good question to ask).
13. For the rest of the questions, invite volunteers to answer from their own experience and perspective by asking, 'Who would like to share their experience on how they were able to resolve this issue?' or 'What do people think about this comment?'
14. After the group members have finished answering the question, you can summarize

and highlight the key ideas and those that best exemplify ideals of gender equality and shared responsibility.

15. The most important part of this activity is that the questions move the group to share their personal experiences. If time permits, give equal attention to all shared experiences, in an attempt to answer all questions.

## Group Discussion:

- How did it feel to hear about the experiences of your peers? Did you learn anything new?
- Was there any fear or concern that surprised you?
- Why don't men talk very much about their concerns about fatherhood?
- Are there any more questions?
16. Using a flip chart paper, present the remaining sessions and their key topics. It is better if this is prepared before the session.

## Close (5 minutes)

- Using the Key Messages, thank all participants for sharing their questions, concerns and experiences.
- Express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session, and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
- Explain that you will use all questions posed in these activities to further inform and shape the coming sessions.
- Remind the group about confidentiality, and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
- Finally, mention that all sessions will include critical reflection on gender socialization, i.e., how boys and girls are raised and educated.

## Key Message:

It is important for us as a group to trust each other and feel comfortable sharing in this space. We have started to learn key skills, such as communicating our needs and listening to each other, that we can begin practicing in this group and with our partners and families.

Sharing experiences with other parents provides a valuable educational opportunity for men participating in these sessions. They become more aware of and responsive to each other's concerns, and benefit emotionally from the supportive environment.

## Homework

The two assignments this week are:

Assignment #1

Ask your partner what is expected of you as a father. Listen to her impressions. This means having an open and accepting attitude rather than reacting defensively. Share with her a concern or fear that you have shared during the first session. Come to the next session prepared to discuss your experiences while having this conversation.

## Assignment #2 (Optional, especially if opting to do the 'letter version' of the Legacy of My Father in the next session)

Bring an object or photo that you associate with your father or main male role model to the next session. This could be a tool, a book, a set of car keys, a strap used for punishment, etc. If you cannot bring in an object, think of an item that you see in your daily life that reminds you of your father. Come prepared to the next session ready to tell a story about the object and about your father. Some items, such as guns, knives, or other weapons, may be the item that you would like to speak about in association with your father, but they are not appropriate to bring in to this group setting. Please draw them or think of them in your mind instead.

## Background Information Before Starting Session 3

This session can have a serious emotional impact on participants and facilitators because violent experiences or other traumatic life events, such as abandonment, family death, and other painful memories may be recollected. Therefore, it is important to give the participants emotional support during this process. Generally, this can be achieved by respectfully listening to the participants, without judging or pressuring them.

- In Lebanon, this session may be especially emotional due to participants' own experiences of war and/or their fathers' experiences of war. It can also be emotional because of the effects these experiences may have had on

their childhoods as well as their relationships with their fathers, who in many cases, may have participated in the Lebanese Civil War.

- Syrian men may also reflect on the traumatic impact the current crisis has on their own children and how the conflict affects their current relationships with their children.

Overall, create an atmosphere where participants are validated for sharing personally emotional and intimate details. The confidentiality commitment should also be reiterated, so that the participants are reminded not to comment on what was said during the session once they leave. For those who shared

traumatic experiences, acknowledge the fact that they were able to press on and continue with their lives despite facing such adversity.

If a participant begins to break down and cry in front of the group, normalize the experience by giving them room to express that emotion. Consider saying, 'Thank you for being brave and trusting us with that story. I'm sure many of the people in this room have had similar experiences like yours.' Others in the group may also feel the need to support this person, and encourage them to do so if it feels appropriate. Often, these moments are what binds a group together. Additionally, explain that you are available and willing to have a separate conversation in private with any participant who requests it, and offer more personalized support by referring those who may need it to professional counseling or therapy. Other participants may react in different ways, including with violence. The priority of the facilitator is to ensure the safety of the participants. It may be necessary to remove a participant and refer them to services that can help them process their experiences in a safe environment. As stated in the background for Session 1, be sure to have referrals to counseling on hand to give to your group members.

Use your own discretion, but should a participant begin to take over a group by dominating discussion to the detriment of others' participation, find an opening and kindly say, 'It sounds like you have a lot of valuable experiences to share with the group. That is great! Do others have similar or different stories they would also like to share?' This technique can be used in any session.

## Session 3: Cycles of Caregiving

## Purpose:

-  To reflect upon the influence that fathers or other male authority figures have had on the participants while they were growing up.
-  To discuss how participants can take the positive aspects of their fathers' influence as well as address the negative impact so as to avoid repeating harmful patterns.

For Men only

## Key Activities and Time: 1.5 hours

1. Check-in and Homework Reflection - 10 minutes
2. Mindful (or Diaphragmatic) Breathing - 5 minutes
3. My Father's Legacy - 1 hour and 10 minutes
4. Circle of Appreciation/Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- Flip chart paper and markers

## Planning Notes:

- Think about the literacy level of your participants. If most can read or write, think about the alternatives to doing 'Legacy of My Father' by writing a letter. This can be a more powerful method than using an object. See the 'Alternatives' box further down in the Procedure.
- Prepare a piece of flip chart paper with the following statements:
- 'One thing about my father that I want

to take into my relationship with my children is…'

- 'Something about my father I do not want to repeat with my children is…'

## Procedure:

## Check-in and Homework Reflection (10 minutes)

1. Welcome and thank all of the participants for coming to the session.
2. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:
- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

## Mindful (Diaphragmatic) Breathing (5 minutes)

3. Introduce 'My Father's Legacy' by saying that this can be an emotionally intense session. They will be asked to recall the memories of their father, which can often bring back painful, as well as happy, experiences. For this reason, to prepare for this activity, they will do a breathing exercise.
4. Ask everyone to get in a comfortable position either standing, sitting in a chair, on the floor, or lying down.
5. Ask the group to close their eyes and focus their attention on their breath, particularly on inhaling and exhaling. They should observe how the breath enters and leaves the body. Ask the group to notice what happens to their stomachs as they are breathing - you want the stomach to expand as you inhale more air, and contract as you exhale it.
6. Tell them to breathe in slowly through their nose for 3 seconds, hold for 1 second, and

breathe out through their mouth for 4 seconds. Do this several times until they feel relaxed.

7. Explain to the group that deep breathing helps to calm, relax, and focus. If they are ever feeling strong emotions - fear, anxiety, nervousness, anger - taking a few deep breaths, and focusing on one's breathing, can help. This type of deep breathing increases the amount of oxygen that enters the bloodstream and improves the functions of nerves that control the heart rate, which can reduce anger, anxiety, and stress.
8. Tell the group that no participant is forced to participate - they may leave the room if they feel the need. However, this is an important activity that will encourage reflection on how men can be more involved fathers. Remind the group of the group agreement that you created together in Session 1. Ensure the agreement is in a visible place in the room.

## My Father's Legacy (1 hour and 10 minutes)

9. Ask each participant to bring out the object that they associate with their father (Assignment #2 from Session 1). For those who did not or could not bring an object, give them a few minutes to think about what that object might be. This object may be a tool, a book, a set of car keys, a strap used for punishment, etc. If you are working with literate groups, consider employing the alternative method described in the box below. If they did not have a father, ask them to think about any male caregiver in their life.

## Alternative Methods to 'My Father's Legacy' for Literate Populations

## (1) A Letter to My Father

Depending on the literacy level of your participants and your comfort level as a facilitator, letter writing may be an alternative (and sometimes more powerful) way to conduct this activity.

Instruct participants to write a letter to their father. They should feel free to share things in this letter that they would otherwise not feel comfortable to share with them. Their father will not actually see this letter nor will anyone among the participants. What would they say to this person about what their relationship meant to them? What are the things about their relationship that they treasure? What do/did they want more of?

Give them 10-15 minutes for this.

## A Video to My Father

Using a smart phone to record a video is another option for this activity and can be particularly useful for participants with lower literacy levels.

Instruct participants to record a video to their father using their smart phone. They should feel free to share things in this video that they would otherwise not feel comfortable to share with their father. Their father will not actually see this video nor will anyone among the participants. What would they say to this person about what their relationship meant to them? What are the things about their relationship that they treasure? What do/did they want more of?

Give them 10-15 minutes for this.

10. Begin the sharing of your object and what it represents about your relationship with their father/male caregiver.
11. Next ask each participant to share a story about the object and how it relates to their father, or main male caregiver from their early lives. Alternatively, they can go around the circle to share details about the letter they wrote to their father. If they did not have either a father or male caregiver in their life, ask them to think about what impact this might have had on them.
12. As each person reads his story, thank him for having the emotional strength to share with the group.
13. Once everyone has finished sharing, thank them once again for the trust participants have to share with the groups.

## Notes for Facilitator Sharing:

14. Reveal the piece of flip chart paper that you have prepared with the following statements:
- 'One thing about my father that I want to take into my relationship with my children is…'
- 'Something about my father I do not want to repeat with my children is…'
15. Read statements out loud. Then, ask participants to turn to the person sitting next to them and share their thoughts about these questions working in pairs.
16. Lead the discussion:
- What are the positive things about your relationship with your father that you would like to put into practice or teach to your children?
- Which things would you rather leave behind?
- In a lot of households, we hear things like 'men should not cry,' 'men should raise sons to be tough.' How do you think this impacted our fathers? How do you think it impacted the way they cared for us?
- How do you think these beliefs affected our mothers?
- How can you 'leave behind' harmful practices to be more involved fathers or male caregivers?
- What do you look forward to in becoming a father, or what do you currently enjoy about being a father?

## Circle of Appreciation/Close (5 minutes)

17. Ask everyone to stand up in a circle.
18. Encourage everyone to stand so that they are 'shoulder-to-shoulder.'
19. Tell participants: 'No one is in front or behind another person. We are all together, equal. It is our practice to end our group meetings with a 'check-out' statement when each person

can briefly say what was important to you in this session. Who would like to start?'

20. After everyone has spoken, make the following closing comments.
- Look around this circle silently at the others who have shared this time with you.
- Take a deep breath in appreciation of the honesty and compassion that we have shared together.
- Now we have the opportunity to take what we have learned and practiced together and share them with our family, friends and colleagues. The changes we make inside ourselves are like a stone in a pond, creating ripples that affect everyone around us.

## Key Message:

It is important that we talk about our relationships with our fathers, to heal and learn from our experiences, and to apply this new awareness to men's roles as fathers. Reflecting on these points will allow men to identify these positive aspects of their life stories that are desirable to replicate for their own children, as well as these negative aspects that should not be repeated.

## Homework and Close:

Ask participants to share with someone that they trust how they plan to: 1) emulate the positive actions of their fathers, and 2) how they want to learn from and transform the negative experiences in order not to repeat them.

If a participant expresses the desire to discuss their reflections from the session with his own father, say that it is a personal decision. Add that if they feel the need to, they should do so, especially if they have resentful feelings toward their father.

## Background Information Before Starting Session 4

This session will provoke a lot of debate among your participants as they explore what it means to be a man and a woman. This may possibly be the first time they have explored this topic. You may encounter resistance to the idea that they should challenge some of these 'traditional' ideas and roles. Some participants may consider certain characteristics or roles as biologically determined, rather than socially constructed. It is important to validate participants' opinions, while respectfully emphasizing that most ideas about manhood and womanhood are learned from the time we are born and that they, therefore, can be un-learned. This does not mean all aspects of manhood are bad! For example, the norm that a man should love and respect his children is a positive norm. One argument that may also arise as part of this discussion is the misunderstanding that sexual orientation is learned. For example, men may resist hugging or kissing their sons for fear of 'making them gay.' In these instances, bring the conversation back to the 'Man Box' and how expression of emotions and giving as well as receiving affection from others has been highly discouraged. Ask them what the impacts are from these highly restrictive norms. For example, men in the Arab region report high rates of depressive symptoms, suicide ideation, and stress.

If a participant says that he thinks women are naturally better caregivers, gently question why they believe that. Ask other participants if they agree or disagree and why in order to generate a discussion.

As a facilitator, it is important to understand the difference between 'sex' and 'gender'. This is because many people defend inequality between men and women as being biologically determined, rather than created by society.

- Biological sex refers to the physical characteristics you are born with. It includes

a person's anatomy, and physical attributes (e.g., external sex organs, sex chromosomes and internal reproductive structures).

- Gender refers to the way society defines the roles, behaviors, activities and attributes of men, women, boys, and girls. These definitions are not fixed, but change over time and are different from society to society. We learn to be our gender by interacting with the world around us - our friends, family, community, media, etc. Sometimes these ideas of how to be a man or a woman are thought to be based on our biology rather than something that we learn (i.e., the common myth that violence is a part of men's biology).

## Guiding Ideas on Gender

- From a young age, both men and women are socialized to follow strict definitions of manhood and womanhood.
- While most Lebanese and Syrian men in Lebanon are supportive of gender equality, some (32% of Syrian men and 22% of Lebanese men in one study) are skeptical and believe that 'more rights for women mean that men lose out'.
- It is important to challenge this way of thinking by highlighting the ways men can also benefit from gender equality (even if the benefits from gender equality for men do not outweigh the disadvantages that gender inequality puts on women and girls).
- Negative impacts of gender inequality include:
- Difficulty coping with the demands of idealized manhood (e.g., feeling ashamed with the inability to earn enough income, that men should not show emotional vulnerability)

48

- Poor physical and mental health as a result of masculine norms that discourage help-seeking behavior
- By reflecting on these harmful norms, men can come to see the benefits of challenging traditional definitions of manhood. For example, some research shows that caregiving enables men to express their emotions and helps them to expand their own definitions of what it means to be a father (i.e., beyond the notion that fatherhood is only based on a man's ability to earn an income, build a house, or give orders).
- We will continue to explore these ideas through session 5 as well, so it is okay if

there are still lingering questions at the end of this session.

## Session 4: Men and Masculinities

## Purpose:

- To understand the patriarchal gender binary and the socialization that creates this binary
- To understand how different forms of violence (from physical to institutional) are used to sustain/ reinforce this binary
- To recognize the challenges men and women face while trying to fulfill societal expectations about gender roles
- To understand the costs of rigid gender roles and convey that it is possible to change
- To understand a more gender equal sharing and division of child-rearing tasks as parents, irrespective of gender and with the children's best interests in mind

For Couples

## Key Activities and Time: 1.5 hours

1. Check-in - 5 minutes
2. Man Box, Woman Box, Human Box - 1 hour 20 minutes
3. Homework and Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- Flip chart paper and markers
- Tape

## Planning Notes:

- Review the Background Information.

## Procedure:

## Check-in (5 minutes)

1. Welcome and thank all of the participants for coming to the session.
2. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of

two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:

- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

## Man Box, Woman Box, Human Box (1 hour and 20 minutes)

3. Divide the participants into two groups: men in one group and women in the other group.
4. Give each group a flip chart paper, a marker, and the following instructions. Give them 20 minutes to complete the following activity.
- a. Men's group: Draw a big square on the flip chart for your group. The box should be almost as big as the paper on the flip chart, though make it a bit smaller as to be able to write items outside the square. Ask the group to brainstorm a list of what society expects from a person when they tell them to 'act like a man.' Place this list inside this square or 'BOX' on the flip chart paper.
- i. The group is also asked to place characteristics that their societies label as 'Not acting like a man' on the flip chart outside the box.
- ii. When the groups have completed filling the area in and the area around their boxes, ask the participants to take 2-3 extra minutes and circle the items on the flip chart that directly relate to men's roles as Fathers.
- b. Women's group: Draw a big square on the flip chart for your group. The box should be almost as big as the paper on the flip chart, though make it a bit smaller as to be able to write items outside the square. Ask the group to brainstorm a list of what society expects from a person when they tell them to 'act like a woman.' Place this list inside this square or 'BOX' on the flip chart.
- i. The group is also asked to place characteristics that their societies label as 'Not acting like a woman' on the flip chart paper outside the box.
- ii. When the groups have completed filling the area in and the area around their boxes, ask the participants to take 2-3 extra minutes and circle the items on the flip chart that directly relate to women's roles as Mothers.
- c. Ask a representative from each group to present the output of their group to the rest of the participants. Each group should take about 5-10 minutes for their presentation.

Note to the Facilitator: If the women's group does not want to present their Woman Box (because of shyness, conservative values, or other issues), the facilitator can present in their place. If this session is being held with men only, follow the activity as instructed, having one group of men be the 'men's group' and the other group of men be the 'women's group'. This adaptation can be especially impactful for men who have to think from a woman's perspective.

5. Lead a discussion with the entire group:
- Where do these messages come from? Who is the messenger? Do the messages differ if they come from a man or a woman (mother, father, teacher, sibling, peers)?
- What are the differences between the two boxes? Are they opposites of one another? How so?
- What are the advantages for men who stay in the Man Box and for women who stay in the Woman Box?
- For example, men who stay in the Man Box may be well-respected by other men. Women who stay in the Woman Box may find it easier socially if they get married.
- What are the disadvantages to staying in the Man Box or Woman Box?
- For example, men may feel constant

pressure to provide or feel depressed that they cannot comply with all aspects of the Man Box. Women may be unable to get work outside the home even though they would like to.

- Are there any advantages of stepping out of the box? What are they?
- For example, more open communication between partners, and/or more peaceful households because each person is part of the decision-making process.
6. Make another box on a new piece of paper from the flip chart. This should be done with all of the participants. Label this box the 'Human Box.'
7. Explain that there are many positive characteristics inside the Man Box. In fact, much of the 'empowerment' work done with women is to create the conditions that give them the skills, voice and agency over the decisions that affect their lives - capabilities that are traditionally seen as 'masculine' in patriarchal societies. Examples of this might be: being a leader; having a career; becoming involved in politics; being an active member of decision-making; etc.
8. Ask the participants to point out the positive qualities of the Man Box. Write them inside the box labeled 'Human Box.'
9. Explain that there are also many positive characteristics inside the Woman Box. Examples might include: spending time with children; expressing emotions; being affectionate and loving; playing an active role in domestic chores; etc.
10. Ask the participants to point out the positive qualities in the Woman Box. Write them inside the box labeled 'Human Box.'
11. Remind the participants of the items that were circled that the participants felt directly related to the roles that fathers and mothers had. Point out how many of these items are now in the 'Human Box.'

## Key Messages:

A person, regardless of their gender or sex, can be any combination of characteristics inside the Human Box. Such decisions should be based on their personal choices as individuals and human beings, not forced upon them based on their gender.

When we aspire to the ideals of the Human Box, we are changing the question from 'how should a man/woman act?' to 'how would a human being act?'

Similarly, we can also change the discourse from 'what are the things that a mother/ father should do?' to 'what are the things that a parent should do?'

## Homework and Close (5 minutes)

Homework: The homework for tonight is for each participant to decide on one task that they will do that is outside of their respective gender boxes. Come ready to the next session to discuss how it was to perform this task. For many women, this may mean not doing a task that they usually do. Ask them to examine why this might be.

- Remind the participants that although being outside of the box will lead to some of the positive things we discussed - it is not going to happen all at once.
- Staying in the box can be harmful, and we should continue to think of ways to break out of this box to be more true to ourselves.
- Thank everyone for coming. Remind everyone about the time and day for the next session.

## Background Information Before Starting Session 5

The ways in which boys and girls learn the societal and cultural rules and norms about how boys, girls, men, and women ought to behave play a tremendous role in shaping their identities, and in influencing dozens of gender-related outcomes later on in life.

'Gender socialization' 18 can be defined as the process through which children learn about the social expectations, attitudes, and behaviors associated with one's gender. Children of all genders begin to acquire a sense of themselves and their place in the world through interacting with caregivers and observing their environment, at very early ages. This process is a crucial component of early childhood development.

Parents and other caregivers, siblings, peers, religious leaders, and teachers all influence children's gender socialization. Research has shown that by the age of three, children know their own gender, and already act according to the behaviors and expectations that they have learned are associated with that gender, typically by imitating the behavior of same-sex family members 19,20 . Schools also greatly affect children's gender socialization. Teachers and peers directly influence gender differentiation by providing boys and girls with different learning opportunities and expectations. Peers particularly encourage and discourage behaviors and interests based on gender stereotypes they have learned and internalized from adults, especially their parents. 21  Religious interpretation and resulting practices also tend to influence ideas around appropriate roles for men and women in society, very often placing women in caregiving roles in the home and men into income-earning and other roles in the public sphere. This confluence of family, school, media and entertainment, peer group, and religious influences a child's - or anyone's understanding of their gender.

Research from around the world finds that if children see their parents and other adults share care work more equally, they tend to do the same as adults. 22  Research in the MENA region demonstrates that witnessing gender norm-defying behaviors, that is, ways of acting by men and women that break traditional ideas, within one's childhood home can have lasting effects in the direction of greater gender equality. In Lebanon, men with fathers who were involved in traditionally feminine household work, and/ or men with life circumstances that forced them to take on new household roles, tended to show more gender-equitable attitudes and behaviors themselves. Research also showed that women with more equitable attitudes could often point to a father who encouraged them to take on non-traditional professions, or who permitted them to choose their own husbands. These findings point to a meaningful ripple effect in the next generation when parents - including fathers - shape more gender-equal homes for their children. Children internalize gender norms about care work from the earliest ages.

## Session 5: Caregiving: The Roles of Mothers and Fathers

## Purpose:

-  To examine individual attitudes about gender differences, roles, double standards, and inequalities.
-  To question how individual attitudes about gender affect behaviors.
-  To reflect upon the time men dedicate to caring for and attending to their children, compare it to the time spent by women, and encourage a fairer distribution of such activities.

For Men only

## Key Activities and Time: 1.5 hours

1. Check-in - 10 minutes
2. Marcio's Story - 45 minutes
3. Gender Boxes Role Play - 30 minutes
4. Homework and Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- Necessary technology to show a film clip (projector, laptop, HDMI cable, internet connection, sound system/speakers)
- Flip chart paper and markers
- Enough copies of the 'Daily Routine' Handouts for all participants (each participant should receive two - one for men and one for women)

## Planning Notes:

- Prepare the laptop and projector ahead of time to show the 'Marcio's Story' video and test it to ensure that the video and sound work.
- Print enough copies of the 'Daily Routine' Handout for homework.

## Procedure:

## Check-in (10 minutes)

1. Welcome everyone back to the group!
2. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:
- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

## Marcio's Story (45 minutes)

3. Have participants assist you in arranging the projector for the next activity.
4. Have everyone choose a comfortable place to sit where they can view the screen comfortably (they do not have to be in a circle).
5. Explain that they will view a short film from Brazil called 'Marcio's Story.'23
6. Ask the participants to pay close attention to

the actions of each of the characters - the father, mother and child - in the film. Request that they focus on the roles, activities and functions that these characters play or act in the film. Tell the participants that while the people make look different and speak a different language, their story is important and can be useful for us here in Lebanon.

7. Play 'Marcio's Story.'
8. As the film plays, the facilitator should read the subtitles out loud if there are low literacy levels in the group.
9. After the video, ask participants to get back into their circle formation.

## Group Discussion Questions

- What did you think about the film?
- How did Marcio's father's absence affect him as an adult?
- What are the differences between Marcio and his father in how they raise their children?
- What supports did Marcio have to support him in raising a family?
- What impact will Marcio's caregiving have on his son, do you think? On his partner?
- Are there similarities between the family in the film and the families in your community? If so, what are they?
- How feasible is it for a man to be an involved father like Marcio in your community?
- What challenges do men and boys face when taking on a greater share of the childcare tasks? What does the Man Box | Woman Box have to do with it?
- If you could, what changes would you make to share caregiving responsibilities more equally with your family members? Facilitator: Write these ideas down on the flip chart paper.

## Gender Boxes Role Play (30 minutes)

10. Remind participants that in the last session they defined the Man, Woman, and Human Box. They also discussed the advantages of breaking out of the Man and Woman boxes.
11. Ask the participants for examples of household problems in relation to their roles as parents that usually occur in the context in which they live. For example, participants may say 'financial difficulties' (example: not having sufficient money to pay for childcare expenses) or 'caring for children' (example: who attends to the baby's needs throughout the day and night).
12. Explain that they will now do a role-play based on one of the issues identified and that they should, together as a group, which one they will perform. It is very important that the participants agree on an issue that is relevant for them in the context in which they live.

Note to the Facilitator: If participants cannot identify an issue the Facilitator can provide one. One possible scenario can be: A man makes $10/day and his family is about to be evicted because they cannot pay the rent. He comes home frustrated after meeting with the landlord. His wife greets him and begins asking for money to meet their daily needs (e.g., food, school fees, clothes, etc.).

13. Divide the participants randomly into two groups:
- a. Instruct Group #1 to act out a scenario using the identified issue as it would appear in a setting of a family. This role-play should follow the roles and characteristics of traditional manhood and womanhood as identified in the Man Box and Woman Box exercise from the previous session.
- b. Instruct Group #2 to act out a scenario using the identified issue as it would appear in a setting of a family that follows the roles identified in the Human Box. These items were previously identified as relevant for any individual, irrespective of gender.

54

14. Ask participants if they have any questions. Then give the groups 10-15 minutes to create and practice their role play. Then ask each group to act out their role play in front of the rest of the participants. Each role play should last approximately 5 minutes.
15. Lead a group discussion:
- For those in the first group, how did you feel during the role play?
- For those in the second group, how did you feel during the role play?
- What was the difference between how the problem was handled in the first group and the second group?
- Did we see violence in the first group? Did we see violence in the second group? (Remember here to highlight ALL forms of violence.)
- What is the impact on the children in the household as it relates to the Group #1 scenario? Group #2 scenario?
16. Close the discussion by thanking participants for their input. Then, say that the Human Box does not solve all their problems. However, given how unstable our situations can be especially in refugee settings - we need to be more flexible and work together and the characteristics of the Human Box help us to be more resilient in the face of life's challenges.

## Key Messages:

Our culture often pressures men and women into certain roles as mothers and fathers. We expect fathers to be the main economic providers, and the main authority figures as well as protectors. For mothers, we expect them to be the primary caregivers and sources of affection. It is important to critically examine these roles and decide for ourselves the type of fathers we want to be.

rMothers and fathers are both able to perform the same functions such as giving love, provide for the needs of the children, protect them from harm, educate them, etc. The approach and style of each parent is different; nevertheless, these differences do not have to be determined by our gender.

Men have not been 'trained' since childhood to take care of the home as women have, but they can learn.

Partnership also means sharing domestic tasks. If both parents work outside the home, they will need to share these domestic tasks more fairly.

## Homework and Close (5 minutes)

Give each participant a 'Daily Routine' Handout located at the end of this session. These handouts are to encourage reflection on the time each parent dedicates to care and household work. The purpose of this is to highlight the disparities and promote a more fair distribution.

To use these handouts, go home and observe how you spend your day. Note each activity in the handout. Ask your partner to fill in their activities. Be sure to include preparation time for the daily routines as well as the actual activity (e.g., scheduling a doctor's appointment for a child, then taking the child to the doctor's appointment.)

Come back ready to share your observations in the next session. If possible, bring both the Men and Women's handouts to the next session.

Confirm the next session's meeting.

## Background Information Before Starting Session 6

This session will focus on asking participants to reflect on the different domestic and caregiving chores carried out in the home. During the discussion, take time to provide some of the information on the state of men and how it relates to unpaid care work provided below.

## Research on Unpaid Care Work

According to research in Lebanon, men report that they spend much less time on unpaid care work than women do. What does 'unpaid care work' mean? It means domestic work like meal preparation, cleaning, and washing clothes, as well as direct care of persons including children, older persons, persons with disabilities, and able-bodied adults, with no financial compensation. 24  It can also mean supporting family businesses and farms, particularly harvesting work in rural areas. 25

Many men say that it is difficult for them to spend time with their children because they work full time. However, all fathers should dedicate time to childcare, doing an activity such as preparing food, reading a bedtime story, giving the child a bath, singing, or helping with homework. This helps fathers to develop a closer relationship with their child(ren). Also, care work does not stop at caring for children. Men should discuss with their partner how they can share the burden of domestic chores such as cleaning, washing clothes, or sweeping.

According to recent research conducted in Lebanon, women report frequently having to assume the main responsibility of washing clothes, cleaning the kitchen or sitting rooms, and cleaning the bathroom or toilet almost unanimously, while only 26 per cent of evermarried men reported having recently carried out these tasks. 26  Syrian men surveyed were more often involved in the traditionally feminine tasks of cleaning the kitchen or cleaning the bathroom than were Lebanese men, which may have to do with changes in household dynamics brought about by displacement and migration and the higher rate of unemployment among Syrian men. Such shifts in roles can create new and stressful dynamics at the household level that cause both men and women to re-examine their roles and identities as men and women.

## Why Engage Men in Care Work?

According to the State of the World's Fathers report, unpaid care work limits women's and girls' opportunities for education, employment, and participation in political and social life. It reduces their earning power, and keeps them dependent on the men in their family. 27  When men take on a more equal role in the home, women are able to work to earn an income, study, and relax. Men also benefit. When men become more involved, they better understand the joys and stresses of caring for their children. Men can become positive role models for their sons and daughters. Research shows that involved fatherhood improves men's own health and well-being.

## Session 6: Caregiving: Power and Household Division of Chores

## Purpose:

-  To analyze the relationship and communication styles fathers have with the mothers of their children in order to identify weaknesses and strengths.
-  To discuss the devaluation of daily housework in society.
-  To increase men's awareness about the existence of power in relationships, reflect on how we communicate and demonstrate power in relationships, and examine the impact of power on individuals and relationships.

## Key Activities and Time: 1.5 hours

1. Check-in - 5 minutes
2. Homework Reflection - 40 minutes
3. Persons and Things - 40 minutes
4. Homework and Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- Filled in homework sheets from previous session

## Planning Notes:

- None

## Procedure:

## Check-In (5 minutes)

1. Thank all of the participants for coming to the session.
2. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:
- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

## Homework Reflection (40 minutes)

3. Remind everyone of the homework assignment from the last session in which they and their partners had to fill out their daily routines in the given handouts.
4. Ask for a few volunteers to share their handouts and to describe the differences between theirs and their partners' daily routines.
5. Ask the following questions:
- What did you realize while doing this exercise about how men and women use their time differently?
- How do you feel about the differences in the ways in which time is spent between men and women? Do you feel these differences are fair? Why or why not?
- How does your partner feel about the current distribution of household tasks? Is she satisfied or unsatisfied? Why?
- Why do we tend to think of activities like cooking or cleaning, and time spent caring for children as not being 'real' work? And why is paid work seen as having more value?
- What would you do to change how you currently distribute your time?
- What can men gain from being more involved around the house? Why would children benefit? Why would women benefit?

## Suggested statement to the group at the end of the activity:

Household tasks should be everyone's responsibility. Even though it is not always possible to share these tasks equally amongst all household members, everyone should take on their 'fair share'. This does not mean that men and women should switch roles, or that men need to take on all of the household tasks. Each family should discuss the activities that need to be done and agree on a fair distribution that is right for their family.

6. Thank everyone for sharing his or her experiences and for doing the homework assignment.

## Persons and Things (40 minutes)

7. Explain that in some households, there is no discussion on how roles should be divided.

Some people are just expected to carry out these tasks without thought to how they might feel about this division.

8. Divide the participants into two groups on each side of an imaginary line. Each side should have the same number of participants.
9. Tell the participants that the name of this activity is, 'Persons and Things'. Choose, at random, one group to be the 'THINGS' and one group to be the 'PERSONS'.
10. Read the following directions to the group:
- THINGS: You cannot think, feel or make decisions. You have to do what the 'persons' tell you. If you want to move or do something, you have to ask the person for permission.
- PERSONS: You can think, feel and make decisions. You can also tell the 'things' what to do.

*Note: it may be helpful to have two volunteers to first act out for the group how a 'person' might treat a 'thing.'

11. Ask each 'person' to take one of the 'things' and do what they want with them.

Note to the Facilitator: Be aware of the racial and other intersecting forms of discrimination (refugee status, economic class, religion, etc.) in your group and how to maintain respect during this role-play.

12. The persons can order the things to do any kind of activity. (Alternatively: the 'persons' can direct the 'things' with hand gestures or words, using their hand to show they must move ahead or back, or jump up and down, or move to one side, or turn around.)
13. Give the groups five minutes for the 'things' to carry out the designated roles.
14. Finally, ask the participants to sit down in a circle and use the discussion questions  below to help them think about the activity.

## Group Discussion

- For the 'things': How did your 'persons' treat you? What did you feel? Why?
- Would you have liked to be treated differently?
- For the 'persons': How did you treat your 'things?' How did it feel to treat someone as an object?
- In your daily life, do any persons treat you like 'things?' Who? Why?

Facilitator Tip: Make a linkage between immigrant / refugee experiences and feelings of oppression by authority figures; by children who may feel that they know more than their parents.

- In your daily life, do you treat anybody like they are 'things?' Who? Why?
- Why do people treat each other like this?
- What are the consequences of a relationship in which one person might treat another person like a 'thing?'
- How does society or culture perpetuate or support these kinds of relationships in which some people have power over other people, and in which a group of people has power over another group?
- How can this activity help you think about and perhaps make changes in your own relationships?

## Key Messages:

People can experience different kinds of oppression (being treated as 'Things'). This oppression can come in the form of discrimination based on refugee status or ethnicity, for example.

Men, for example, can feel like less than Persons and more like Things by the way their bosses treat them.

It is important to remember the connection between how you might feel oppressed or treated like 'objects' in some of your relationships and how you, in turn, might treat others, including women, like 'objects.'

The unequal power imbalances between men and women in intimate relationships can have serious repercussions for the risks / exposure to violence and the overall wellbeing of the family.

Thinking about these connections can help motivate us to construct more equitable relationships in our homes and communities.

## Homework and Close (5 minutes)

The homework for participants is to continue to reflect on the ways in which household relationships can cause men to treat others as 'Things' rather than 'Persons'. They should make an action plan on how they can carry out one thing to avoid treating their partner and/or child as things.

Do a 'one word' check out that summarizes how they felt about today's session. Thank everyone for coming and confirm the date, time, and location of the next session.

## Background Information Before Starting Session 7

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) was adopted in 1979 by the General Assembly of the United Nations, including Lebanon, albeit with some reservations. Article 7 of Lebanon's Constitution also prohibits discrimination and affirms that all citizens are equal before the law.

Despite these laws, men's use of violence against women is widespread, both at home and in public spaces, and in all forms: physical, sexual, emotional, and economic. While many men describe spousal violence as being a thing of the past, pointing to women's improved status as proof that violence is less common and less acceptable, research shows otherwise. The World Health Organization (WHO) has found a global lifetime prevalence of intimate partner violence at 30 per cent; Equimundo's International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) found that in Lebanon, approximately 23 per cent of ever-married men reported ever having used emotional violence (e.g., insults, humiliation, intimidation, threats) against a female partner, with 27 per cent of women affirming they had experienced this violence. Tolerance of men's use of intimate partner violence is common, though not as high as other countries in the region: 26 per cent of men and 14 per cent of women said they believe that wives should tolerate violence to keep the family together. Additionally, nearly 60 per cent of women reported having ever experienced some form of sexual harassment in the street; one-third of men reported having ever carried out this harassment. 28

This violence against women occurs in a broader context of political instability, the legacy of the 15-year civil war that ended in 1990, and the neighboring Syrian conflict, which has led to the influx of refugees. Lebanon has the highest number of refugees per capita in the world - approximately one in four people currently in Lebanon is a refugee, 29  and 71 per cent of Syrian households in Lebanon live below the poverty line. 30

Whether or not men ask for services, be sure to include resources at the beginning of this

session for men to receive support. ABAAD Men's Counseling Center offers free services to men for this purpose and can be reached through a hotline at +961 71 28 38 20.

## Resource Sheet: Defining Gender Violence 31

Gender-based violence: Violence involving men and women, in which the woman is usually the victim. This violence is derived from unequal power relationships between men and women. Gender based violence is directed specifically against a woman because she is a woman, and often affects women disproportionately. It includes, but is not limited to, physical, sexual and psychological harm (including intimidation, suffering, coercion, and/or deprivation of liberty within the family, or within the general community). It also includes violence that is perpetrated or condoned by the state.

Violence against women: Any public or private act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty.

Sexual Harassment: Indecent proposals, obscene words, and pressure to have sexual relations, that are unwelcomed by the other party.

## Session 7: On Violence

## Purpose:

-  To define violence and to identify the different types of violence that occurs in families and in communities.
-  To practice non-violent ways to react when we become angry.

For Men only

(Child) sexual abuse: Any type of intimate (sexual) physical contact between an adult and a child.

Rape: The use of physical force or threat in order to obtain penetrative sexual relations (oral, vaginal or anal).

Emotional Violence: Often the most difficult form of violence to identify. It may include humiliating, threatening, insulting, pressuring, and expressions of jealousy or possessiveness such as the controlling of decisions and activities. It can also include restricting someone's movements. This form of violence can be verbal or non-verbal. The consequences for both men and women may be low selfesteem, distrust, and emotional insecurity.

Sexual exploitation: Taking advantage of or involving children or adolescents in the sexual satisfaction of adults, including activities such as child prostitution and pornography.

Sexual violence: Pressuring or forcing someone to perform sexual acts (from kissing to sex) against their will or making sexual comments that make someone feel humiliated or uncomfortable. It does not matter if the person has previously consented to sexual behavior - consent must be given at the time.

Physical violence: Using physical force such as hitting, slapping, kicking, burning, or pushing.

## Key Activities and Time: 1.5 Hours

1. Check-in and Homework Reflection - 10 minutes
2. What is Violence? - 30 minutes
3. Cycle of Violence - 45 minutes
4. Homework &amp; Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- Flip chart paper and markers
- Pieces of paper or sticky post-it notes
- Pens
- Brochures: (1) Where men and families can seek counseling services for mental health concerns; (2) Where women can seek services for domestic violence

## Planning Notes:

1. In preparation for 'What is Violence?', write down the definitions of violence (written in the body of this activity) on the flip chart paper. Cover these definitions with another piece of paper so the participants do not see them until you show them later.
2. Before the Cycle of Violence activity begins, the facilitator should set up five (5) flip charts on the wall. On each flip chart write one of the following phrases:
- a. Violence used against me
- b. Violence that I use
- c. Violence that I have witnessed
- d. How I feel when I use violence
- e. How I feel when violence is used against me
3. From early pilot tests of this session, it was observed that it was much easier for men to talk about the violence they had suffered, particularly forms of violence that took place outside their homes. It was even noticed that they felt a certain relief in being able to relate these experiences they had survived. Commenting on or talking about violence

committed against them inside their homes was a more delicate matter. Some young men commented on domestic violence; however, they did not want to go into details. It is important to be careful not to insist.

For men, talking about violence they themselves had committed was even more difficult. They tended to justify themselves, blaming the other person for being the aggressor.

Warning: This activity can often extend into two sessions. Should you feel that the participants do not wish to expose personal details, do not force them. Instead, ask them how another person would feel in the situation. Being a survivor of interpersonal violence is strongly associated with committing acts of violence later. Helping men grasp the connection and think about the pain that violence has caused them is a potential way of interrupting the victim-aggressor cycle of violence.

As noted in the Materials, it is important to have resources on hand to refer those who may need additional counseling or therapy.

4. When talking about violence against children, it can become even more taboo because many parents do not recognize 'small' kinds of violence such as slapping lightly on the wrist as violence. Even small kinds of violence teach children that violence is the only way to resolve conflict or disagreement. These difficult moments are often the best times to teach our children better ways and focus on our longterm goals for our children.

## Procedure:

## Check-in and Homework Reflection (10 minutes)

1. Welcome and thank all of the participants for coming to the session.
2. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:

- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

## What Is Violence? (30 minutes)

3. Explain that the purpose of this activity is to discuss what violence is and the different types of violence that exist.
4. Ask the group: 'What is violence?' Allow them to share their opinions. Write down the responses from the participants on a flip chart paper.

Note to Facilitator: If participants identify general types of violence such as 'physical,' ask them for specific examples of this.

## After everyone has shared, explain to the group:

'At its simplest level, violence is the way for one individual to have control or power over another. Violence is not a random act. It happens in specific circumstances and settings. Violence happens more frequently in some settings than others, such as during periods of conflict, but it is also very present in our homes and communities. Violence often occurs within the family and is often perpetrated by men against women and by parents against children, although these are not the only types of violence.'

5. Tell the group that acts of violence can be divided into several broad categories. Unveil the definitions of violence to the group:
- Physical violence: Using physical force such as hitting, slapping, kicking, burning or pushing.
- Emotional or Psychological violence: Often the most difficult form of violence to identify.

It may include humiliating, threatening, insulting, pressuring, and expressions of jealousy or possessiveness such as the controlling of decisions and activities. It can also include restricting someone's movements. This form of violence can be verbal or non-verbal.

- Sexual violence: Pressuring or forcing someone to perform sexual acts (from kissing to sex) against their will or making sexual comments that make someone feel humiliated or uncomfortable. It does not matter if the person has previously consented to sexual behavior - consent must be given at the time.
- Economic violence: When someone else exercises complete control over a person's money and other economic resources. This type of violence is a way of exerting power and can be used to control someone's movements, for example, keeping them from meeting friends, etc.
6. Going down the brainstormed list, ask participants what kind of violence is listed until all kinds of violence have been categorized.

## Discussion Questions:

- What are the most common types of violence that occur against children?
- Note to Facilitator: Probe for common types of violence committed against children in schools, at home, on the street, during conflict. As stated in the Preparation notes, some men may be resistant to the idea that forms of corporal punishment such as yelling or slapping a child ('hitting that does not leave a mark') is violence. Think about how to respond to this.
- What are the most common types of violence in romantic relationships?
- Is any kind of violence worse than another?
- What is the most common type of violence used against men?

64

- What is the relationship between power and violence? (Encourage the participants to think of the different types of power (economic, physical, etc.) that a person can have over another and link to violence).
- Note to the Facilitator: It is important that participants understand that both men and women use violence; however, it is important that the conversation not be side-tracked by discussion of women's violence against men. As the facilitator, you can explain to the group that while there are cases of women perpetrating violence against men, the overwhelming majority of violence is perpetrated by men against women. If the conversation becomes stuck on this issue, try and move the discussion along by asking another question.

## Cycle of Violence (45 minutes)

Note to the Facilitator: As noted in the preparation notes, before the activity begins, the facilitator should set up five (5) flip chart papers on the wall. On each paper, write one of the following phrases:

- a. Violence used against me
- b. Violence that I use
- c. Violence that I have witnessed
- d. How I feel when I use violence
- e. How I feel when violence is used against me

Note to the Facilitator: Check the literacy level of your group. If there is low literacy, have participants draw examples of violence on their pieces of paper or post-its. Alternatively, you can pair participants together to discuss the topics then ask for feedback in the larger group discussion. The facilitator can then write up the responses on the corresponding flip charts.

7. Explain to the participants that the purpose of this activity is to talk about the violence they experience in their lives and their communities, including the violence they use and the

violence used against them. The group will then discuss their feelings in relation to these types of violence. If necessary, review the flip chart from the previous activity that shows the different types of violence.

8. Give each participant 5 pieces of paper or post-it notes. Explain that there are 5 flip chart papers, and each flip chart represents one of the following titles:
- Violence used against me
- Violence that I use
- Violence that I have witnessed
- How I feel when I use violence
- How I feel when violence is used against me
9. Review the five categories and ask the participants to reflect on them and then write a short reply for each on a separate piece of paper. Each person should write at least one reply for each flip chart (or category). Allow about 10 minutes for this task. Explain to them that they should not write much, just a few words or a phrase. (They should not write their names).
10. After ten minutes, explain that they should put the phrase on the corresponding flip chart.
11. Tell participants that they will go on a 'gallery walk' to see what they and others have shared. However, stress that this is a SILENT activity, so there should be no discussion or laughter.
12. Ask participants to go on a 'gallery walk' and read the responses.
13. Proceed to the Discussion Questions.

## Discussion Questions:

- How did you feel as you read the responses on the flip chart papers? Which flip chart impacted you most? Why?
- What was it like to think about the violence that you yourself experienced? What was it like to think about the violence that you used against other people?

- How can you tell if you are really committing violence against someone?
- Is there any connection between the violence you use and the violence that is used against you?
- Some researchers say that violence is like a cycle, that is to say, someone who is a victim of violence or witnesses violence is more likely to commit acts of violence later on in life. If this is true, how can we, as men, interrupt this cycle of violence?
- In general, when men are violent or when they suffer violence, do they talk about it? Do they report it? Do they talk about how they feel? If they do not, why not?
- What role do men have in preventing violence against women? Explain.
- What role do men have in preventing violence against children? Explain.
- What have you learned in this activity to help overcome violence? Have you learned anything that can be applied in your own life and relationships?

## Close with the following statement:

Too many people have experienced or witnessed violence at some point in their lives, often at the hands of men. It is commonly assumed that violence is a 'natural' or 'normal' part of being a man. However, violence is a learned behavior - boys and men are often raised to think that violence is an acceptable means of maintaining control, particularly over women and children, resolving conflicts, or expressing anger. Just as violence is learned, it can be unlearned and prevented. With this in mind, it is the responsibility of all individuals, women and men, to strive to raise boys and men, as well as girls and women, to understand how violence, be it men's violence against women or a parent's use of violence against a child, prevents individuals from building positive and loving relationships.

## Circle of Appreciation/Close (5 minutes)

14. Ask everyone to stand up in a circle.
15. Encourage everyone to stand so that they are 'shoulder-to-shoulder.'
16. Tell participants: 'No one is in front or behind another person. We are all together - equal. It is our practice to end our group meetings with a 'check out' in which each person can briefly say what was important to them during the session. Who would like to start?'
17. After everyone has spoken, make the following closing comments.
- Look around this circle silently at the others who have shared this time with you.
- Take a deep breath in appreciation of the honesty and compassion that we have shared together.
- Now we have the opportunity to take what we have learned and practiced together and share them with our family, friends and colleagues. The changes we make inside ourselves are like a stone in a pond, creating ripples that affect everyone around us.

## Key Messages:

At its most basic level, violence is a way to control or have power over another person. People often only think about violence as physical aggression, but there are other forms of violence as well. Most often, this violence is targeted towards individuals or groups that more vulnerable or marginalized in our communities.

Violence is a violation of a person's human rights, whether it is enacted against women, men or children.

Violence on an individual level is a behavior, which is learned and can be unlearned. It is social responsibility of each individual to work on eliminating violence (at least those forms of violence that can be prevented by individuals) in the community, starting - with oneself.

## Homework and Close (5 minutes)

Pass out the brochures on where men and families can seek counseling services. Also pass out brochures with information on seeking services for domestic violence.

As homework, invite men to have a conversation with either their partners and/or with their sons or daughters. During this conversation, they may share how they felt while remembering an act of verbal, psychological or physical violence that was done against them. This would be an excellent opportunity to make a promise within the family that disagreements will always be resolved without using violence and with respect for the other person's right to disagree.

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences. Recognize the participants' efforts, what they have learned about their experiences, and how this learning will allow them to approach stressful situations without violence and to instead use dialogue to resolve problems with their families.

Do a 'one word' check out that summarizes how they felt about today. Thank everyone for coming and confirm the date, time, and location of the next session.

## Background Information Before Beginning Session 8

You have now completed half of your sessions with your Fathers Group. Congratulations! You have explored issues of power and gender dynamics in the household and how such unequal relationships contribute to lack of harmony in the home and in men's relationships with others. In particular, men reflected on how stereotypes about what it means to be a man create emotional distance between themselves and others, perpetuate the use of men's violence against others, and creates unrealistic expectations that many men are unable to fulfill. The group will now build on these reflections to talk about how men and women can contribute to healthy early childhood development including how to create more gender equitable environments that allow both sons and daughters to thrive.

In 1991, Lebanon signed onto and ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child which guarantees children a life without violence of any form, including physical punishment. It also recognizes children's right to respect and dignity. Childhood is defined as the period between conception and eight years of age. This is the period in which children 'learn by doing' meaning they explore the world around them by using physical objects that they can manipulate. In this chapter we will mostly focus on the first 1,000 days (or first three years) of life. This is because the most rapid period of brain development takes place during the first two to three years of life, laying the foundation for future learning and social function, among other things. All children are born with the intellectual and social capacities to thrive; however, there are serious consequences if these are not recognized and nurtured by those closest to them. Children are the future of the country. Through them, older generations pass on traditions, knowledge and values including the importance of equality, respect, love, taking care of one another, and the

importance of hard work. By ensuring a happy, safe environment for children we contribute to ensuring that such values live on.

However, parents living in unstable contexts face many barriers to supporting early childhood development. UNHCR estimates that 20 people are forcibly displaced every minute as a result of conflict or persecution. In such contexts, children living in areas of conflict and post-conflict face acute disadvantages. In addition to physical harm, children also experience psychological stress and trauma as a result of conflict and crisis situations. There are also consequences for children's socioemotional learning and development. Loss of or separation from family members can lead to issues of low self-esteem, feelings of insecurity, and anxiety, among other issues. They also face challenges academically when it is time to enter school. For example, in Lebanon, Syrian refugee students struggle to succeed in local classes which are mainly taught in French or English, as opposed to classes in Syria which are traditionally taught in Arabic. According to experts, early childhood development (ECD) programs can be a lifeline for the youngest children, helping to keep them safe and give them hope for the future. Supportive adult relationships and quality ECD programs can mitigate, prevent, and even reverse the damaging effects of this stress response.

## Fatherhood and Gender Socialization of Children

When fathers engage in housework and child care and spend time with their sons and daughters, these contribute to boys' acceptance of gender equality and to girls' sense of autonomy. 32  Engaged fatherhood can also help protect children from violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect, and it can help ensure their access to health and education. When daughters and sons see their fathers in respectful, non-violent, equitable relationships with their mothers and other women, they then internalize the idea that men and women are equal and that intimate partners treat each other with respect and care. These children often grow up to pass on these notions of respect and equality to their own children. 33 If there is time, look at the Supplementary Activities section to integrate a session that discusses the influence of the toys we give to children and how those shape - and limit their ideas of what it means to be a man or a woman, and what they can achieve. For all the sessions in this chapter, ask participants to think about the following: how the way we raise boys and girls differ and challenge them to think of ways to create a more equitable environment for both sons and daughters.

According to research, the overwhelming conclusion is that fathers are a necessary element as caregivers for their children. They found that fathers are an essential part in helping to raise sons and daughters who are more likely to become involved, gender equitable and connected caregivers themselves.

## Establishing Long-Term Parenting Goals

To begin this chapter on early childhood development, you will work with parents to establish long-term parenting goals. The purpose of these goals is to get parents thinking beyond what they need and want now, and allow their caregiving to be guided by their own vision of what they hope their children will become. These goals will serve as an important foundation for future sessions on early childhood development. As you facilitate this session, tell parents that short-term frustrations block the achievement of their long-term goals. By yelling and hitting, they are teaching their children how to deal with such difficult emotions and they may someday repeat what they learn from us.

## Session 8: My Child in Twenty Years

## Purpose:

-  To make connections between the long-term goals fathers and mothers have for their children and how harsh discipline affects those goals

For Couples

## Key Activities and Time: 1.5 hours

1. Check-in - 5 minutes
2. My Child in 20 years - 45 minutes
3. Co-Listening Exercise - 30 minutes
4. Homework and Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- Copies of 'My Parenting Goals' Handout for each couple
- Copies of 'Relationship Quality Inspection' Handout for all participants
- Pens or markers and paper

## Procedure

## Check-in (5 minutes)

1. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of

two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:

- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

## My Child in 20 years (45 minutes)

2. Put the following script into your own words:

'For new mothers, fathers, and other family members, having a young baby is joyful, exhilarating, exhausting, and an enormous challenge. Parents feel that they have an extraordinary responsibility to ensure the health and happiness of their children. But few, if any of us, ever receive instructions on how to raise a child. We learn by instinct, from our mothers and fathers, and by remembering how

we were cared for when we were children. As we explored before, parents are at risk of repeating harmful behaviors that they themselves experienced in childhood if there is no thoughtful reflection about how this will impact our children's future. In these next few sessions, we will explore the best parenting techniques to support happy, healthy children.'

3. Ask participants what the difference is between a short-term goal and a long-term goal?
4. Say that, 'When we think about what we want for our children we often focus on the shortterm. We want them to stop crying, we want them to put on their shoes, we want them to clean their rooms, etc.'
5. Ask participants, 'What other short-term goals we have for our children (ages 0-3)?'
6. Tell participants that fathers and mothers live such stressful lives focusing on providing for the needs of the family, that they forget the long-term goals of who they want their children to become.
7. State that this exercise will focus on creating long-term goals for their children. Ask participants to close their eyes and ask them to imagine their child in 20 years. Say, 'Imagine what he or she will look like at that age. What kind of person do you hope your child will be? What kind of relationship do you want with your child(ren)?'

Note to the Facilitator: Participants, particularly those coming from conflict settings, may have a difficult time imagining what tomorrow will bring, let alone what their children's lives will look like in 20 years. If this is the case, take extra time to explain, answer questions, and discuss what types of goals they want.

8. Pass out the 'My Parenting Goals' handout (1 copy per couple) or tell them to open their notebook to this handout. Explain that each couple will discuss what goals they want to achieve by the time their children are grown up. This might include goals such as, 'I hope my child will be thoughtful and courteous towards others.' Emphasize that these goals

should be about what kind of person they want their child(ren) to become, rather than about their future occupation (e.g., 'I want them to become a pilot') or material possessions (e.g., 'I want them to own a car').

9. Ask couples to leave the circle and find a quiet spot where they can discuss their goals. Give them 5-10 minutes to fill out the handout.
10. Ask for a few volunteers to share their goals.
11. Explain that long-term goals take a long time to achieve, but they are at the heart of parenting.
12. Ask participants:
- When you yell, what are you teaching your son/daughter about respect?
- When you hit your son/daughter, what are you telling her about how to solve problems?
- How does yelling and hitting impact your long-term goals?
13. State that children learn to cope with stress by watching how adults do it. If fathers yell when they are stressed, boys will learn that this is how they should deal with stress. Girls will learn that this is how men deal with stress (and how they must deal with it as well). State that, 'Every time you react this way, you lose an opportunity to show your child a better way of reacting'.

## Co-Listening Exercise (30 minutes)

14. Explain that now couples will have the chance to discuss how to put these long-term goals into practice.
15. Ask partners to sit face-to-face.
16. Explain the skill of 'co-listening': In pairs sitting face-to-face, the first participant must speak for five minutes, responding to questions (in Steps 18, 20 and 21) posed to them by their partner. The role of the partner asking questions is to be silent, listen and observe. During those five minutes, the listener must not speak or interrupt even if they would like to

70

ask clarifying questions or make comments.

17. Tell everyone that the first question is for women. They will speak for five minutes. The second question will be for men who will also speak for five minutes.
18. Ask the first question: What support do you need from your partner to help your child reach their long-term goals? Give women five minutes to speak and then ring a bell or gently let the group know that time is up.
19. After the five minutes are up, ask for a few volunteers to share some of the challenges they experienced.
20. Ask the second question: What support do you need from your partner to help your child reach their long-term goals? Give men five minutes to speak and then ring a bell or gently let the group know that time is up.
21. Ask the final question stating that, 'Now either partner can begin speaking: One thing that would make me feel more loved by my partner is…? Give each partner a few minutes to discuss.
22. Ask participants to come back to the circle and reflect on the exercise and what surprised them the most. In particular:
- Did you learn anything new about their partner that you did not know before?
- What can you do as partners to address the challenges your husband / wife talked about?
- What can you do to continue this practice of co-listening at home?

## Key Messages:

Our children look to us as their role models. When we hit, yell, and otherwise lose our temper, we are impacting the achievement of our long-term goals. Choose every disagreement or difficulty as an opportunity to model what you hope they will become as adults.

Listening to one another in a relationship is a critical part of a healthy partnership. In listening openly, we learn more about the other's perspective and see things from their side. This can lead to a more satisfying and collaborative relationship that also creates a healthy environment for children. Like so many other things, when children see that their parents are communicating well, they will emulate this as they grow up.

## Homework and Close (5 minutes)

This week's homework assignment is the following:

1. Fill out the Relationship Quality Inspection. Ask them to complete this handout with their partners, and return with the results in the next session. Each participant should receive two copies of the Relationship Quality Inspection, one for themselves and one for their partner.

Note to facilitator: This homework assignment assumes a moderate to high level of literacy among participants. If you are facilitating this activity with a group that has low literacy levels, think about how you can adapt this assignment. Feel free to brainstorm with the participants as well.

2. Spend at least 15 minutes playing with your child(ren) this week thinking about the longterm goals you established in today's session.

Do a 'one word' check out that summarizes how they felt about today.

Thank everyone for coming and confirm the date, time, and location of the next session.

## My Parenting Goals Handout - Session 8

Directions: Think about who you hope your child(ren) will someday become. List 3 characteristics you would like your child to have in 20 years.  Remember, this is not about status or occupation, this is about what kind of person you hope your child will become.

Example include: 'Always honest with his/ her parents' 'loving towards everyone who is important in his/her life,' 'trustworthy,' 'a hard worker.'

Goal #1:

To adapt this activity for participants with low literacy levels, instruct them to draw their goals for their children rather than write them.

Goal #2:

Goal #3:

## Relationship Quality Inspection Handout

This homework is for you to take home and do with your partner. You will not have to share the results with the group as it is only for your personal use. Be honest and use this as a tool to open up a more honest and loving conversation. If you do not have a partner, share the homework assignment with another couple you know, such as your parents, married siblings, or friends.

Directions: Give a rating on a scale of 1 to 3 (1=Agree; 2=Partially Agree; 3=Disagree) for each of the statements below. Each person should fill out answers on a separate sheet of paper. After you and your partner finish, add the total number of points for each column and compare your results with your partner.

| You   | Partner   |                                                                   |

## Background Information Before Starting Session 9

In this next session, men will learn to empathize with young children who are unable to express themselves (or even understand the emotions that they feel!) and take time to understand the different stages of child development. During this session, participants may have lots of questions about why babies cry and what to do when they are unable to comfort them. They might also have lots of questions about men and biology. Remember, you are not an expert so take care that you do not provide information that is incorrect. Below is some useful information about the biology of fathers to bring to your groups.

## The Biology of Fathers

The brain changes displayed by primarycaregiving fathers are similar to those found in primary-caregiving mothers. Multiple studies confirm that men who are in close physical contact with their infant children show changes in body chemistry similar to women's - hormonal changes that promote or facilitate adult-infant bonding. The bottom line is that, apart from breastfeeding, men can care for children in every way that women can. One study found that levels of 'nurturing hormones' are similar in men and women exposed to 'infant stimuli' before their babies are born (e.g., watching a video of a baby, listening to an audiotape of babies' cries, holding a doll wrapped in a blanket recently worn by a new born) and when interacting with their children afterwards. 34  Within 15 minutes of holding a baby, according to this study, men experience increases in the hormones that facilitate responsiveness to infants (vasopressin), closeness and care (prolactin), and affection and social bonds (oxytocin).

In short, men's bodies react when in close contact with children in many similar ways to women's bodies. Both men's and women's biochemistry changes to facilitate their bonding with young children. These changes are likely part of our evolution, according to evolutionary psychology; children with more caregivers - and caregivers who were more attuned - were more likely to survive and thrive than those without. 35  Human evolutionary history suggests, according to many authors, that all humans, regardless of sex or gender, survive and thrive if they are loved and cared for. In evolutionary terms, all evidence shows that men and women alike possess the traits that foster an innate human capacity to be connected, nurturing caregivers.

17 - 24 points: Our relationship has serious shortcomings that need attention.

25 - 30 points: Halt! Serious issues detected!

## Session 9: Building Empathy

## Purpose:

-  To promote empathy with your young child through understanding where they are in their development

For Men only

## Key Activities and Time: 1 hour

1. Check-in - 10 minutes
2. Why Is the Baby Crying? - 45 minutes
3. Homework and Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- YouTube Clip, من كثير تفهمها لا لغة الأطفال بكاء معه والتعامل لفهمه الطرق هذه إليك .. الأمهات https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=WNHBEVBGGaQ&amp;feature=youtu.be
- Enough copies of the handout 'Caring for Babies' for all participants
- Enough copies of handout 'Stages of Child Development' for all participants

## Planning Notes

This session will begin by showing a YouTube video with techniques for calming a baby. As this video is directed towards women, it is imperative that as facilitator, you introduce it with some information about the importance of men taking on caregiving responsibilities equally with their partners. After showing the video, continue with the discussion questions in this session.

## Procedure

## Check-in (10 minutes)

1. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of

two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:

- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
2. Remind the group that in the last session they were given a homework assignment. Ask for a few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- a. How did they feel doing the assignment?
- b. What were the reactions from others?

## Why Is the Baby Crying? (45 minutes)

3. Ask participants: What is the most stressful part of having a newborn baby in the house? What usually happens at night? Ask them what does the mother usually do when they are holding a crying baby? What do they do?
4. Play the YouTube video: هذه إليك .. الأمهات من كثير تفهمها لا لغة الأطفال بكاء معه والتعامل لفهمه الطرق https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=WNHBEVBGGaQ&amp;feature=youtu.be
5. As detailed in the notes, note how the clip is directed towards women.
6. Thank all participants and proceed to the group discussion.

## Group Discussion Questions

- What did you think was wrong with the baby?
- As you were watching the clip, what did you feel in your body and in your mind when the baby would not stop crying?
- Why do babies cry? What can we do to get them to stop crying?
- Note to the Facilitator: For this question, ask participants to break into small groups and brainstorm a list for 5-10 minutes. Write these down on the flip chart paper. Create as long of a list as you can (optional).
- How can reacting negatively (e.g., yelling at the child, giving the child to someone else to calm, shaking the baby, etc.) impact your long-term goals for your child?
- Have you gone through this situation in your own life? What did you do?
- Why are women often seen as having better skills to care for babies than men? What does this have to do with the Woman Box?
- For example, from an early age men have been trained to be tough and women to embrace compassion and caregiving.
- Are there ever differences in how parents comfort a baby boy versus a baby girl? How so? Why is there this difference? What impact does this difference in the way we comfort boys versus girls impact children?
- Note to the Facilitator: Link this with the Man Box, Woman Box, Human Box activity from Session #3.
- What is one thing you can do this week to address the emotional needs of your baby or young child?

## Key Messages:

Babies are new to this world. They can get easily frightened, so they need to know that they are safe and protected. This can be especially challenging when a country is at war or a family is experiencing financial hardship.

However, fathers and mothers can do a lot to provide safety. Babies do not use or understand words and as a result, cry to let us know when they need something. Sometimes they cry for no reason at all!

Babies do, however, learn quickly whether they can trust us to respond. One of the ways to respond is to hold, cuddle, rock, and carry your baby.

If your baby feels safe, he or she will learn to trust you and learn new things.

Cuddling is also good for a baby's brain and can help them build connections among the brain cells!

As we have learned before, one is not born knowing how to care for a baby's needs. It can and should be learned by everyone.

## Homework and Close (5 minutes)

Give out this week's homework:

1. Read the handouts 'Caring for Babies' and 'Stages of Child Development' with your partner.
2. Spend at least 15 minutes of quality time with your child this week.

Participants should come ready to share their experiences in the next session.

Do a 'one word' check out that summarizes how they felt about today. Thank everyone for coming and confirm the date, time, and location of the next session.

## Caring for Babies Handout 36 - Session 9

Parents can get very tired of caring for babies. Some men - for many reasons whether because they were not taught how to care for babies or have relied on the female members of the household, or for other reasons - may feel particularly uneasy when the demands of babies are high. Sometimes, they might feel like hitting or shaking the baby if the baby does not stop crying. There are consequences, however, for reacting in this manner:

- The baby may become afraid of you
- The baby can become physically and psychologically impaired (a baby's skull is very fragile and not fully developed before 18 months)
- You can injure them, causing bruises or even broken bones
- Babies are fragile and can die
- This will impact the long-term goals you have for your child

## Never shake a baby!

If your baby will not stop crying, he or she needs to know that you are there. He or she needs to be held and comforted. You will not always be able to calm a crying baby. If you feel yourself becoming frustrated or tense, ask for help from others in your home or community. If you are alone, put the baby safely down and take some deep breaths. When you feel calm again, pick the baby back up to continue comforting them.

## Colic in Babies 37

Sometimes no matter how much you try to comfort your baby, he or she will not stop crying. The reason for this may be colic, or excessive fussiness. Colic can be particularly frustrating for parents because the baby's distress occurs for no apparent reason and no amount of consoling seems to bring any relief. These episodes often occur in the evening, when parents themselves are often tired. In general, colic is defined as crying for three or more hours a day, three or more days a week, for three or more weeks.

The cause of colic is unknown. It may result from numerous contributing factors including:

- A digestive system that is not fully developed
- An imbalance of healthy bacteria in the digestive tract
- Food allergies or intolerances
- Overfeeding, underfeeding or infrequent burping
- An early form of childhood migraine
- Family stress or anxiety

There are things you can do to address a colicky child. These include:

- Using a pacifier
- Taking your infant for a car ride or on a walk in a stroller
- Walking around with or rocking your baby
- Swaddling your baby in a blanket
- Giving your baby a warm bath
- Rubbing your infant's tummy or placing your baby on the tummy for a back rub
- Playing an audio of heartbeats or quiet, soothing sounds
- Providing white noise by running a white noise machine, a vacuum cleaner or clothes dryer in a nearby room
- Dimming the lights and limiting other visual stimulation
- Changing your baby's diet, such as using a different formula.

If you yourself feel stressed, overwhelmed, depressed, or simply exhausted with your child, remember that there are lots of things you can do to take care of yourself and get the

support you need. This includes taking a walk, getting a sleep (even during the day when your baby is sleeping), seek help from others, and remembering that it is temporary. Most babies grow out of this phase after 3 or 4 months.

## Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) 38

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death, usually during sleep, of a seemingly healthy baby less than a year old. SIDS is sometimes known as crib death because the infants often die in their cribs. Although the cause is unknown, it appears that SIDS might be associated with defects in the portion of an infant's brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep.

## Factors that put babies at risk for SIDS:

- Brain defects. Some infants are born with problems that make them more likely to die of SIDS. In many of these babies, the portion of the brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep has not matured enough to function properly.
- Low birth weight. Premature birth or being one of a multiple birth delivery increases the likelihood that a baby's brain has not matured completely. Babies under these circumstances have less control over automatic processes such as breathing and heart rate.
- Respiratory infection. Many infants who have died of SIDS had recently had a cold, which might contribute to breathing problems.
- Sleeping environmental factors: The items in a baby's crib and his or her sleeping position can combine with a baby's physical problems to increase the risk of SIDS. Examples include:
- Sleeping on the stomach or side. Babies placed in these positions to sleep might have more difficulty breathing than those placed on their backs.
- Sleeping on a soft surface. Lying face down

on a fluffy comforter, a soft mattress or a waterbed can block an infant's airways.

- Sharing a bed. While the risk of SIDS is lowered if an infant sleeps in the same room as his or her parents, the risk increases if the baby sleeps in the same bed with the parents, siblings or pets.
- Overheating. Being too warm while sleeping can increase a baby's risk of SIDS.

## What can be done about SIDS?

There is no guaranteed way to prevent SIDS, although you can help your baby sleep more safely by following these tips:

Back to sleep. Place your baby to sleep on his or her back, rather than on the stomach or side, every time you - or anyone else - put the baby to sleep for the first year of life. This is not necessary when your baby is awake or able to roll over both ways without help.

Do not assume that others will place your baby to sleep in the correct position - insist on it. Advise nannies or child care providers not to use the stomach position to calm an upset baby.

Keep the crib as bare as possible. Use a firm mattress and avoid placing your baby on thick, fluffy padding, such as lambskin or a thick quilt. Do not leave pillows, fluffy toys or stuffed animals in the crib. These can interfere with breathing if your baby's face presses against them.

Do not overheat your baby. To keep your baby warm, try an adapted baby sleeping bag or other sleep clothing that does not require additional covers. Do not cover your baby's head.

Have your baby sleep in your room. Ideally, your baby should sleep in your room with you. The baby should, however, sleep alone in a crib, bassinet or other structure designed specifically for infants, for at least six months and if possible, for up to a year.

Adult beds are not safe for infants. A baby can become trapped and suffocate between the headboard slats, the space between the mattress and the bed frame, or the space between the mattress and the wall. A baby can also suffocate if a sleeping parent accidentally rolls over and covers the baby's nose and mouth.

Breast-feed your baby, if possible. Breast-feeding for at least six months lowers the risk of SIDS.

Do not use baby monitors and other commercial devices that claim to reduce the risk of SIDS. Many experts discourage the use of monitors and other devices because they have been found to be ineffective and because of safety issues.

Immunize your baby. There is no evidence that routine immunizations increase SIDS risk. Some evidence indicates immunizations can help prevent SIDS.

## Background Information Before Session 10

In this session you will lead a discussion with men on the importance of expressing and recognizing emotions both in themselves and with their children. Numerous studies find that positive father involvement - just like the positive involvement of mothers and other caregivers - is associated with a child's emotional and social development and the development of empathy. Playful and affectionate interaction with fathers can predict children's positive social-emotional involvement with others, particularly with their peers, while harsh discipline by fathers is sometimes associated with later behavioral problems for boys and girls. Father's involvement has been linked to lower rates of depression, fear, and self-doubt in their young children. It can prevent behavior problems in boys and psychological problems in girls. 40  This session will talk about how learning emotions starts early on in development. For instance, babies need to hear emotions labeled (for example, 'I'm sad', 'You're happy,' 'You're excited when Daddy picks you up'), along with appropriate facial expressions and behaviors that go with the emotion. This helps babies to learn to self-regulate. They eventually learn to identify emotions, understand what this emotion does to the self and others, and learn to react accordingly. Research has found that parents who used more of these emotion-labeling comments had lower heart rate variability, meaning they were better at regulating their emotions and coping with a challenging situation. 41

However, in order to be the role models and caregivers that children need, men (and women) need the skills necessary to express and recognize emotions in others. This can be especially challenging if men did not have emotionally responsive caregivers when they themselves were children. According to research in Lebanon, 58 percent of men and 37 percent of women reported having experienced one or more forms of neglect, emotional abuse, or physical abuse in their homes as children. Boys may have been particularly vulnerable to violence and corporal punishment:

half of men surveyed reported having been slapped or spanked in their homes as children. 42

Mental health issues can also impact a man's healthy expression of emotions. In areas surveyed, 28 percent of men reported depressive symptoms, with Syrian men showing higher rates of depression than Lebanese men. The effects of conflict were frequently cited as a reason for depressive symptoms. Syrian women and men alike reported that men felt they had lost their identity due to the conflict in Syria. Some 37 percent of Syrian men said that they had given up looking for work. High rates of work stress and depressive symptoms were reported among the Lebanese population as well.

In respectful ways, encourage men to think thoughtfully about how they can continue to break out of the 'Man Box' to express emotions in healthy ways while keeping in mind the challenges they face. Fathers need to know that, together with other family members, they are the ones who are also teaching their children how to identify an emotion and how to express it. Children learn through observation: if men think that they should not cry when they are sad, they are then teaching their children to act the same way. Fathers, and parents in general, need to be aware that children learn this message through observing how their parents cope with emotions and conflict.

This session will also tackle the importance of recognizing and naming emotions that children experience. This can be especially challenging to do with boys, as traditionally boys receive messages from media, peers, and family members to hide such emotions. Encourage fathers to break out of the 'Man Box'! Challenge fathers' unfounded fears that closeness and expressions of emotion 'promote homosexuality.' Encourage fathers to be the role models that their sons need by showing their own emotions and encouraging its expression in their own children. In addition, ask them to think about how this may have a positive impact.

## Session 10: Recognizing Emotions in Ourselves and Our Children

-  To recognize the difficulties men face in expressing certain emotions and the consequences for themselves and their relationships.
-  To learn to recognize and name the emotions our children experience and express.

For Men only

1. Check-in - 5 minutes
2. Ranking of Emotions - 45 minutes
3. Recognizing Our Children's Emotions - 45 minutes
4. Homework and Close - 5 Minutes

## Materials:

- Flip chart paper and markers

## Example Ranking of Emotions

|                |   Fear |   Affection |   Sadness |   Happiness |   Anger |
|----------------|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Participant #1 |      5 |           4 |         3 |           2 |       1 |
| Participant #2 |      2 |           3 |         4 |           1 |       5 |
| Participant #3 |      4 |           1 |         3 |           2 |       5 |
| Participant #4 |      4 |           3 |         5 |           2 |       1 |
| Participant #5 |      5 |           1 |         3 |           2 |       4 |

## Preparation

Prepare the ranking score sheet on a flip chart paper. Below is an example of how to organize the columns of emotions and participant responses. During the discussion, the facilitator should help the participants identify similarities and differences in rankings. For example, the table below shows that there is an almost even split in the number of participants who find it easy to express anger and those who find it difficult. This could lead to a discussion about why these differences exist, and whether men generally find it easy or hard to express anger. It could also lead to a discussion on how this affects men's relationships with family, friends, and partners. Another interesting pattern in the table is that most find it difficult to express fear. Often, men are expected to be fearless. This example can serve as a basis for discussion about socialization and gender norms.

Note to the Facilitator: It is important to remember that the table's rankings should be anonymous. That is, each line should represent a participant's ranking, but it should not include names. The facilitator can instead assign numbers to which the participants can easily refer to during the discussion.

## Procedure

## Check-in (5 minutes)

1. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:
- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

## Ranking of Emotions (45 minutes)

2. Ask participants to remember: What did the Man / Woman Box / Human Box exercise show us about men and emotions?
3. Tell participants that today's session will explore how men express emotions and how to promote healthy expression of emotions with their children.
4. Refer their attention to the five columns on the flip chart paper and write the following emotions as headings across the top:
- Fear
- Affection
- Sadness
- Happiness
- Anger

Note to Facilitator: For groups with low levels of literacy, use an alternative to words such as symbols, emoticons with different expressions, or different colors to represent each emotion.

5. Explain to the participants that they will be thinking about and discussing how easy or difficult it is for men to express these various emotions.
6. Give all participants a small piece of paper and ask them to write down the five emotions on the paper, in the same order.
7. Read the following directions:

Think about which of these emotions you express with greatest ease. Put a number one (1) next to the emotion that is the easiest for you to express. Then think about the next easiest emotion for you to express and put a number two (2) beside it. Put a number three (3) next to the emotion that is third easiest; it may not be too hard, but it also may not be very easy. Put a number four (4) next to the emotion you have even greater difficulty expressing. Finally, put a number five (5) next to the emotion that you have the most difficulty expressing.

Note to Facilitator: For groups with low levels of literacy, use an alternative method rather than numbers to rank the emotions - for example, lines (e.g. one line for the emotion that is easiest to express, two lines for the next easiest, etc.) or shades of color.

8. After all of the participants have finished ranking their emotions, collect the papers and write down the rankings in the columns on the flip chart (see example in the Preparation section).
9. Explain that the emotions that were numbered as one and two are the ones men have often learned to express in an exaggerated way.  Numbers four and five are those that men have not learned to express as well, or that men may have learned to repress or keep hidden. Number three may represent an emotion that men do not exaggerate or repress and probably deal with more naturally.
10. With the entire group, reflect on the similarities and differences found among the participants.

11. Also ask:
- In what ways are men discouraged from expressing emotions?
- What impact does this have?
- How do the emotions men express (or do not express) impact sons? Daughters?
12. Close by saying: emotions are not like light bulbs. You cannot turn them on and off. However, how we choose to express them is up to each and every one of us. This does have an impact on us, our partners and our children. Fathers, together with other family members, are the ones who are teaching their children how to identify an emotion and how to express it. Children learn through observation: if men think that they should not cry when they are sad, then their sons and daughters who are watching them are learning to act the same way.

## Recognizing Our Children's Emotions (45 minutes) 43

13. Hold up the first laminated illustration and read it out loud to the group. If possible, have copies of the illustration for each participant.
14. As they look at Illustration #1, ask participants:
- What do you think Sami is feeling?
- Is it necessary for the father to criticize Sami at this moment? Why or why not?
- How do the corrections/criticisms make Sami feel?
- Why are the father's reactions unhelpful?
- Would the reactions be different if the child was a girl?
- How can the father be more supportive of Sami's emotions?
15. Hold up the second laminated illustration and read it out loud to the group. If possible, have copies of the illustration for each participant.
16. Discuss the following:
- What did the father do differently this time?
- How does he encourage Sami to keep

doing his homework?

- How did this help the father achieve his long-term goal for Sami?
- How can you help your child recognize his or her feelings as they grow older?
17. Pass out the Handout on Recognizing Emotions.
18. Do an emotional check out - what are the emotions they are feeling in their bodies at this exact moment?

## Key Messages:

There are many benefits to recognizing and expressing our emotions and recognizing and acknowledging the emotions our children experience. Men are socialized not to express vulnerable emotions such as pain or sadness. This can have long-term consequences on their health, their relationships, and to society. We can break this cycle with our children.

When we talk about our feelings, it helps children recognize the feelings of others, it gives them choices on how to behave, and they learn that all emotions are okay!

## Homework and Close (5 minutes)

Assign the homework:

1. Using the Handout, participants should practice recognizing the emotions in their child(ren) and acknowledge their emotions out loud. Do this at least 3 times this week.
2. Direct participants to spend at least 15 minutes of quality time with their child(ren) this week.
3. Encourage participants to share with their partner what they learned during this session.

Remind everyone to come ready to share their experiences in the next session.

Do a 'one word' check out that summarizes how they felt about today. Thank everyone for coming and confirm the date, time, and location of the next session.

## Session 10

As children grow, they learn how to express themselves and look to you, as parents, to learn how to do so. Young children have a hard time identifying how they are feeling and often react in frustrating ways such as hitting or biting. However, these moments are also opportunities for learning. Starting at 6 months of age, children become sensitive to how their parents react to situations and this in turn influences how they themselves respond.

## Why should we talk about feelings?

- It helps children communicate their own feelings. It helps children understand emotions (i.e., what does someone do when they are sad?), how to cope with specific emotions, and how to use the understanding of their emotions to alter their behavior
- It helps children connect feelings to actions and to understand their body language
- Children learn that all feelings are OKAY and important!
- It helps us learn about our child's feelings
- It becomes easier for children to be empathetic and to connect to our feelings
- It helps children recognize feelings in other people
- It shows children that they have choices on how to behave

## Strategies to help children express emotions

- Name the feeling: Help children name their feelings by labeling them. 'Daddy had to go to work, you are sad. You said you want your Daddy.' Naming feelings allows young children to develop an emotional vocabulary

that provides them with a means to talk about their feelings.

- Identify feelings in themselves and others: Talk about feelings they have and those that you see in others. For example, 'I hear you laughing, are you happy?' Or 'She fell down, how do you think she feels?'
- Talk about how feelings can be expressed: Lead by example. Talk about your own feelings and how you express those feelings. What do you do when you get mad? How do people know you are happy? Talk about ways that your child can express their emotions.

## Ways to comment on feelings

- You look very proud when you put on your shoes by yourself!
- This is a frustrating game, and you are remaining calm
- I feel happy when you greet me with a smile
- You look excited when we are going on a walk together
- I really enjoyed playing with you!
- It can be sad to put away the toys
- It makes me feel good when you help your brother

Learning to identify and express emotions in a positive and healthy way helps young children build a strong foundation for well-being later in life!

## Background Information Before Starting Session 11

In this session, you will guide participants in an exercise to encourage good behaviors through the provision of verbal praise. Oftentimes, parents believe that they should only give praise when their children have accomplished something 'extraordinary' such as receiving high marks on an exam. However, as very young children learn about the world around them and how to act within these spaces, they are constantly seeking attention from those they love around them. Babies, for instance, are highly motivated and want to respond to anything new in their surroundings. As their confidence grows they become more capable, self-sufficient, and self-motivated. The more this curiosity is encouraged and supported through verbal affirmations, the more confidence they will have in the future. Through this session, remind participants of the basics of praise. It is not enough to say 'Good job!' Praise should also be done with a distinct intention that focuses on encouraging the solving of problems, or the carrying out desirable behaviors.

Praise is often viewed as spoiling children and teaching them negative behavior, as well as overly inflating their self-esteem. However, acknowledging good behavior and praising it, in fact, leads to children's improved behavior and well-being, including reduced levels of hyperactivity and inattention.

For your children, providing praise is a good way to 'serve and return', an approach known to support early childhood development. In this approach, children learn language and how to interact with others when their caregivers are responsive to their needs and engage with them in positive ways. Giving praise should be given in this 'serve and return' context - the child says or does something (serves), the parent responds (returns) and so on. It is very easy to ignore children's attempts to communicate and engage. As such, applying the 'serve and return' approach teaches children to take turns, which is essential for building language skills.

## Session 11: Providing Warmth and Structure

## Purpose:

-  To learn to say what you see - how to give praise and express love
-  To learn how to provide structure for young children

For Couples

## Key Activities and Time: 1.5 hours

1. Check-in - 10 minutes
2. Giving Praise - 15 minutes
3. Illustration Practice - 45 minutes
4. Giving Praise Role-Play - 15 minutes
5. Homework and Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- The laminated 'Giving Praise' illustration
- Copies of the 'Giving Praise' handout for all participants

86

## Planning Notes:

In this session, it will be important to look at the gendered aspect of praise. For example, praising boys who wrestle or 'play fight' also reinforces potential violent behavior later on. Be sure to bring this topic up during the session and ask participants to reflect and brainstorm ways to refrain from praising the 'wrong' behaviors.

## Procedure:

## Check-in (10 minutes)

1. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:
- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
2. Remind the group that during the last session, they were given a homework assignment. Ask fora few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- a. How did they feel doing the assignment?
- b. What were the reactions from others?

## Giving Praise (15 minutes) 44

3. Ask participants to stand up in a circle. Ask them what does the word 'praise' mean? Get a couple volunteers.
4. Agree on a definition of 'praise.'
5. Ask partners to face each other and give one another praise or a small positive comment. It can be about anything.
6. Tell participants to sit down and ask them: How did you feel giving praise to one another? How did you feel receiving praise?

## Illustration Practice (45 minutes)

7. Explain to participants that: part of providing a safe and healthy environment for young children is to give praise for the good behaviors we want them to continue doing. We often think that the only thing worthy of praise is attained accomplishments (e.g., achieving high marks in school). However, we often forget that children desire our attention all the time, even if it is negative (e.g., yelling). As parents, to encourage good behavior in children, we have to praise positive everyday behaviors (e.g., finishing their food, cleaning their room) that they are normally expected to do. This will encourage children to continue to do them in the future.

This can be difficult for parents to take on, especially in our culture in which too much praise can be seen as 'spoiling a child', but this is a healthy way to encourage good behavior in children and build confidence.

8. Show the Giving Praise illustration to the group.
9. Ask participants:
- How does the father encourage Sami to play quietly?
- How does he specifically point out good behavior?
- What might have happened if he ignored Sami?
- Why should we praise our child's good behavior even when it is 'expected' of them?
- What is a bad way of giving praise?
- Praising behaviors that are firmly in the Man Box (e.g., praising boys who kick or 'play fight' with other boys or girls)
- Using the word 'but'. For example, 'Thank you for helping BUT you are making a mess!' This can discourage the child from doing the behavior you want.
- What do our children learn when we praise their behavior?

10. Get out a flip chart paper and markers. Ask: What are the types of behaviors we would like to see in our children? Or what would we like to see in the future (when they are no longer babies)?
11. Write these down on the flip chart paper. These might be things such as, 'sharing with their brothers and sisters,' 'talking nicely,' or 'listening to my requests.'
12. Ask the participants for 'tips' on how to encourage such behavior using praise.
13. Distribute the 'Giving Praise' handout to all participants. Share the 7 basics of giving praise listed in this handout. These include:
- Give praise immediately (right after they do something you want them to continue doing).
- Give praise for a specific thing the child did or for a specific way the child behaved.
- Give your child your undivided attention when you praise them.
- Smile at your child. This will show them that you are happy with their behavior.
- Give your child a hug. It will make them (and you!) feel good.
- When possible, praise your child in front of other adults. They will know you are proud of them and are not afraid to show it in front of others.
- Never praise and criticize in the same breath. Praise should be nothing but good.

## Giving Praise Role-Play (15 minutes)

14. Explain that they will now do a role play. Break participants into small groups. Ask that there be a 'parent,' 'child,' and 'observer' in each group. Explain that any participant can play any role - men can play parent, child, or observer, and women can play parent, child, or observer. Ensure that participants are mixing roles by gender (for example, that not all women are playing the parents and all men are playing the children and observers).

## Note to the Facilitator:

- During the role-plays, the person role-playing the 'child' should not be acting out or intentionally behaving badly. This role-play is about praising good behavior we want children to continue doing every day.
- Acknowledge through laughter or making a simple joke that it may feel silly or awkward for men to play the role of the child in the role-play. However, remind them that they are practicing new skills before they apply them to the real world. This is a safe space to do so.
15. Ask for participants to role-play different scenarios in which the parent is giving the child praise for good behavior. If you like, you can assign a scenario from the brainstormed list of good behaviors from Step #11.
16. After a few minutes, reflect on the experience with the group. How did they feel doing the exercise?
17. Pass out the 'Giving Praise' handout.

## Key Messages:

When we bring attention to our child's behavior by giving praise, they will behave that way more often.

Use specific words of praise rather than making vague statements.

Ensure that praise is given without criticism.

## Homework and Close (5 minutes)

Give participants the homework:

1. Tell the participants to aim to praise their child(ren) for good behavior at least 3 times this week and note their reaction to this praise.
2. With their partner, participants should fill out the handout on 'Giving Praise to your Child', in which they will discuss positive behaviors they would like to see more of in their children and how they will use praise to encourage such behavior.

They should come ready to share their experiences during the next session.

Do a 'one word' check out that summarizes

## Background Information Before Starting Session 12

In this session, you will begin exploring with parents how to create constructive consequences for when children do indeed misbehave and create opportunities to learn from such behavior in the future, otherwise known as 'positive parenting.' When children misbehave, there is usually a reason:

- They are tired
- They are hungry
- They feel powerless or misunderstood
- They want your attention

Throughout this session, you will emphasize that there are no bad children. Only bad behaviors. In order to address bad behaviors, it is often important to first understand where the bad behavior is coming from. This will help to prevent bad behaviors from occurring in the future.

You do not need to be an expert in positive parenting or early childhood development to facilitate this session. However, if you are not an expert, it is very important that you follow the activity closely and do not provide alternative

- Talking nicely
- Being patient
- Listening to requests

Write these down in the box below. Come ready to share these responses with the larger group in the next session.

methods or examples of parenting techniques that may reinforce harmful dynamics and messages between parents and children.

## Positive Parenting and Babies (12 months and younger)

Children younger than 12 months old are too young to understand positive parenting. The best thing that a parent can do is provide lots and lots of love in the form of cuddling, kisses, and hugs.

- As stated before, parents must never shake or hit a baby.

When parents find their patience wearing thin, they must apply their 'cool down' plan. If there is time, ask couples with babies to develop a cool down plan that they can put into use in the home.

## Positive Parenting (12 months to 3 years old)

Toddlers are beginning to become more independent and will feel the need to explore the world around them, often in ways that could put them in danger. They will dislike when parents tell them 'no'. They get frustrated when you do not understand their words. As you explain the different positive parenting techniques, emphasize that they must ask themselves to be realistic about what their toddler can do independently. Parents must also aim to create a safe environment for their children in the home, to the extent possible. For example, put unsafe things out of arm's reach and keep a close eye on toddlers at all times. If parents recognize that they made a mistake by disciplining a child for something they did not do, for example, they should apologize and set a positive example. It is also important to remember that young children have a very short memory, meaning that parents will need to (patiently) repeat instructions many times. For babies, parents must use simple explanations and show the baby what they mean. Babies are concrete thinkers and thus cannot understand abstract ideas yet.

In this session, the topic of inequality and violence against Syrian children in schools may come up. Many refugees in Lebanon are often rightly frustrated by the ill treatment that they and their children receive. There are also issues that arise with birth registration, as Lebanon does not give Syrian children born in Lebanon registration papers. Be knowledgeable about these issues before starting the session.

## Session 12: Using Positive Parenting

## Purpose:

-  To learn how to respond and give age-appropriate levels of discipline for young children

For Couples

## Key Activities and Time: 1.5 hours

1. Check-in - 10 minutes
2. Responding with Positive Parenting - 1 hour and 15 minutes
3. Homework and Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- Laminated diagram of 'When to Use Positive Parenting'
- 5 Illustrations of Positive Parenting Techniques
- Copies of Positive Parenting Techniques Handout for all participants

## Planning Notes:

There may be some resistance to the positive parenting approaches in this session because there is a cultural belief that children should solve things on their own by any means necessary rather than have the parent intervene. It is believed that children become 'stronger' and more resilient when they solve problems on their own. In some cases, this is true and children should be taught ways to be self-reliant in ageappropriate ways. However, they must first be given the tools by their caregivers to solve problems without using violence. In this session, it will be important to emphasize that parents are important models for their children and will learn from their example.

## Procedure:

## Check-in (10 minutes)

1. Lead a check-in. There are two options to check-in. One is to recap what was discussed in the previous session. The second is to do a more in-depth recap using the following questions:
- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
2. Remind the group that in the last session they were given a homework assignment. Ask for a few volunteers to share how the homework assignment went.
- How did they feel doing the assignment?
- What were the reactions from others?

## Responding with Positive Parenting (1 hour and 15 minutes)

3. Explain to participants that for the past few weeks they have improved their understanding of their children's needs. They

have also explored how a father is more than just a provider - men are parents who are equally capable of providing an emotionally and developmentally safe environment in which their children can thrive and grow.

4. Tell them that challenges are inevitable. Parents will experience, and probably already have, challenges when children do not always do what parents ask, even when they give them praise.
5. Ask participants to share some of the biggest challenges they have had getting their children to behave. For example, 'children can be very demanding - they want everything', 'children always seem distracted by technology!'
6. Emphasize that there are no bad children, only difficult behaviors. Children are not inherently bad, there are just behaving in inappropriate or difficult ways.
7. Discuss a father's roles as the disciplinarian in the family. Ask: What does being a disciplinarian have to do with the Man Box? For example, traditionally, (though not for all families) fathers are seen as the ones who enforce the rules and create a sense of order and respect in the family.
8. Ask participants what are the common ways men discipline their children, especially when they become angry or frustrated? What about women? Does this ever depend on whether the child is a girl or a boy? State that when children misbehave, parents commonly yell, threaten, or even hit children. This can interfere with parents' long-term goals.
9. Explain in this session that there are better ways to use discipline in ways that are non-violent. Today, they will learn about 'positive parenting'.
10. Before discussing the techniques, open the flip chart to the Positive Parenting Diagram.

Note to the Facilitator: Babies under 18 months need love in the form of physical closeness (e.g., cuddling), and other forms of physical and emotional support while

fulfilling their physical needs such as food, warmth, shelter, etc. Share that these positive parenting techniques are most effective with children 19 months and older, and should be used while considering the stage of the child's development.

11. Ask if there are any questions.
12. Take out the six laminated illustrations for 'Positive Parenting Techniques.' Explain each technique to participants using the handout. Emphasize that for parents with very young children, some of these techniques may not be appropriate for their developmental age.
13. Divide participants into groups of four. If couples are attending this session, assign two couples to each group and give each one an illustration.
14. Ask each small group to discuss their assigned illustration. What do they notice about the positive parenting techniques being used? Have they seen or tried such techniques before?
15. Give them about 10 minutes to discuss.
16. Explain that they must prepare a new role-play based on their positive parenting technique. The role-play should be based on a common dispute they face in their household - for example, when a child does not want to do something a parent tells him or her to do, or when siblings fight over a toy.
17. After 10-15 minutes, have each group explain their positive parenting techniques and then role-play their scenario for the larger group. Proceed to the group discussion.

## Group Discussion

- What obstacles might you face in using these positive parenting techniques?
- Which technique would be easiest to use with your own children? Why?
- Which technique would be most difficult to

use and why? What could you do to make it easier to use?

- What are other ways to discipline children in ways that helps you to achieve your long-term goals?
- Who else in your home needs to be engaged in using positive parenting techniques?

## Key Messages:

Positive parenting techniques are not common in our homes. They can be difficult to learn and sometimes do not work to quiet a child as quickly as hitting, slapping or yelling.

However, these aggressive techniques create fear, as we discussed earlier in our sessions. They interfere with our long-term goals for our children.

Positive parenting means that we will be teaching the values we want a child to learn.

Parents must be patient, as the rewards of positive parenting can take time.

## Homework and Close (5 minutes)

Assign the homework:

Participants should use at least 1 of these ageappropriate positive parenting techniques this week with their child(ren).

They should come ready to share their experiences in the next session.

Do a 'one word' check out that summarizes how they felt about today. Thank everyone for coming and confirm the date, time, and location of the next session.

<!-- image -->

## Positive Parenting Techniques - Session 12

1. FIX UP When a child hurts another child or breaks something - expect them to fix it or at least help.

## Example:

Your child hits another child while playing. You ask, 'Why did you hit your friend?' Let them explain and then say, 'that was not the best behavior - we do not hit our friends.' Explain why the behavior was wrong and ask, 'Would you like to say sorry to Lama and make her feel better?'

2. IGNORE Ignore, but then give attention when they show good behavior.

## Example:

You tell your child that it is time to go to bed. The child says they would like to continue watching television. You insist that it is time to go to bed. The child begins to cry and scream. You ignore the behavior. Once the child has calmed down, say again, 'It is time for bed' and offer to read the child a bedtime story.

Example of Fix Up:

3. SEPARATION When children squabble or fight, separate them and let them play apart. Being apart provides time for them to calm down.

## Example:

Your daughter complains that your son will not share his toys. They begin to scream and yell at each other. Separate your children into different rooms until they calm down and encourage them to apologize and make up.

4. BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT Talk with children calmly about the disagreement. Come to a solution that is agreeable to you both. This lets them take responsibility for their behavior.

## Example:

Your daughter complains that your son will not share his toys. They begin to scream and yell at each other. Intervene by asking what is the best way to address the problem? Support them in carrying out the solution.

## Example of Fix Up:

<!-- image -->

5. COOL DOWN When children are misbehaving tell them that they are misbehaving and suggest another activity.

## Example:

Your child hits another child while playing. You say, 'that was not the best behavior - we do not hit our friends.' Say that you will read a book until they have cooled down and are ready to apologize. her feel better?

6. SYMPATHIZE AND REDIRECTION When children want something they cannot have, or want to do something they are not allowed to do, sympathize with their disappointment or frustration and interest them in something they can do.

## Example:

'I know it is very sad to put away your toys, but you will be able to play with them again tomorrow. Thank you for being such a good boy. Let's go brush your teeth and then read a story.'

## Example of Ignore:

## Background Information Before Starting Session 13

Congratulations! You have nearly completed the fathers' group program. Over the past several weeks, you have guided men and their partners through crucial sessions on what it means to be a man, led them to explore relationship power dynamics, encouraged them to be equal partners in caring for their children, provided crucial information on parenting techniques, and created an open environment for learning.  Now, the next hour or so will focus on the importance of making commitments and creating systems of support to encourage the achievement of these commitments. Men, in particular, may find it difficult to find individuals who can support them, let alone seek out support. Draw their attention to the Man/

I know it is very sad to put away our toys,

to play with them but you will be able

again tomorrow.

Woman/Human Box and ensure that you take time to challenge these norms.

One thing that would be nice is to organize a celebration, together with community leaders, to commend the changes that have occurred on the part of both mothers and fathers. Such a celebration in the community shares the positive impacts of the program and encourages community members to support men in their growth as men and as fathers and to hold them accountable. It also holds the participants up as role models for other community members to emulate and may create change beyond the group.

Alternatively, you can end the group program with some sort of outing for the couples to celebrate their achievement. This can be a dinner out at a restaurant or a different type of cultural activity. Be sure to reflect on what is possible for everyone financially and logistically before planning!

## Session 13: Making Commitments to Change

## Purpose:

-  To celebrate the changes men have made and for them to make commitments to themselves to continue these changes into the future

For Couples

## Key Activities and Time: 1.5 hours

1. Check-in - 10 minutes
2. Making Commitments - 45 minutes
3. My Support Network - 30 minutes
4. Final Close - 15 minutes

## Materials:

- Large notecards -4-5 cards per participant
- Pens/pencils
- Tape
- Flip chart paper and markers
- Copies of the 'My Support Network' handout
- •
- Certificates of Completion (optional)

## Planning Notes:

Read the background on Session 12 before beginning today's session.

Hang flip chart paper on the wall with a title, 'COMMITMENTS TO CHANGE' written at the top in large letters.

## Procedure:

## Check-in (10 minutes)

1. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:
- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

## Making Commitments (45 minutes)

2. State that today is the final session they will have

100

together as a group. Say a few words about how much this group has meant to you and what you have learned from the other fathers.

Write some notes here about what you like to say about how much this group has meant to you and what you have learned from the other fathers.

3. Going around the circle, ask for a few of the others to share what they have learned and how they feel now that the group is ending.
4. Thank the group for sharing.
5. Explain now that the group is coming to a close, that it is important that they create commitments to keep promoting change to be more involved fathers and partners.
6. Provide participants with 4-5 notecards and ask them to write down one action per card that they can do in the next 6 months to be more involved fathers and husbands.
7. If the participants are okay with it, ask them to write their names on the cards.
8. After everyone has finished, have them go around the circle and share at least 1-2 actions that they will adopt over the next 6 months.
9. Ask participants to tape their Commitments to Change on the flip chart paper.
10. Ask them to congratulate one another for making these commitments.

## My Support Network (30 minutes)

11. Explain that in order to ensure that these commitments are achieved, they will need to rely on others, especially when they are facing challenges.
12. Pass out the 'My Support Network' spreadsheet to all participants or draw the

circles on a flip chart. Remind them that these circles may look familiar to them from the first session, but we will be using them in a different way today.

13. Tell the group they should imagine themselves at the center of the circle. Tell the group they should put themselves at the center of the circle. In the circles around the center, they should write (or imagine) the names of those who they can rely on for support or advice. The people they can rely on the most should be in the rings closest to the center. Those who provide less support or advice should be placed in the outer rings/circles. Tell the participants that 'support' can be moral guidance, parenting advice, financial and/or material assistance.
14. Give the participants 10-15 minutes to complete their handouts. After 10-15 minutes, ask if any of the participants would like to share their social support network with the whole group.

Note to Facilitator: If the literacy level of the group is low, ask the participants to think about who they would put in the circles, rather than writing it out.

15. After some individuals have shared their networks, open the discussion using the questions below.

## Discussion Questions:

- Was it easy or difficult to identify the people who you can rely on for help and support?
- In what ways do these individuals and networks help you as an individual, as a father and as a partner? What advice do they provide?
- Why is it sometimes difficult for men to ask for help or support? What does this have to do with the Man Box?

- Why is your partner an important source of support in your network?
- How can they support you when you are having a challenging time providing care for your children?
- When you have a disagreement with your partner, who can you turn to for advice?
- Is it easy or difficult to talk to your partner about the problems you face? Why is this?
- How can you provide the same type of support you wish to have from others, particularly your partner?

## Key Messages:

We have learned a lot together over these past several weeks.

We must continue our efforts to be more present fathers by making commitments to change.

Support networks are crucial for us to accomplish our parenting commitments

Men are often socialized to be self-sufficient and to never seek help, even when they need it! It is important that we challenge these norms in order to become better partners as well as fathers.

## Final Close (15 minutes)

Thank participants again for their participation in the group over the past several weeks. Encourage them to continue learning, listening, and practicing their new skills. Ask participants, if they have not already, to exchange contact information so that they can continue communicating with each other now that group has been completed. Suggest the setting up of a WhatsApp group so that they can continue the conversation online.

Handout certificates of completion (optional) and close the group with one final check out.

Supplementary Sessions

In this section you will find supplementary sessions that are beneficial and appropriate for fathers' groups. If you have more than 13 sessions, we recommend incorporating some or all of these sessions into your program.

## Background Information Before Starting 'Caring for My Baby'

It is important for you as a facilitator to know the background of the participants of your group before embarking on activities. With this session, some families may have maids or domestic workers who help with caregiving. Despite this help, it is still important for fathers and mothers to participate in these activities in order to foster love and connection between parents and children. The goal of this activity is for fathers to share domestic and caregiving responsibilities equally with the partner. However, should there be resistance towards learning about baby care, emphasize that this skill is important for everyone to know because support will not always be present. This is for the baby's health, especially if they are sick, and a sense of safety.

Provide information if fathers have further questions about the skills learned or other practical questions.

## Supplementary Session: Caring for My Baby - Practice Makes Perfect!

## Purpose:

-  To learn about a baby's care needs and reflect upon men's capacity to satisfy those needs
-  To question the stereotype that women are naturally better equipped to provide better care and upbringing for children than men are
-  To reflect on how gender stereotypes influence a father and mother's behavior towards his or her child

For Men only

104

## Key Activities and Time: 1.5 hours

1. Check-in - 10 minutes
2. Caring for My Baby: Practice Makes Perfect 1 hour and 15 minutes
3. Homework and Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- Several water bottles or dolls to represent babies.
- Baby bottles
- Handout for Session 11 'Baby Care Tips'

## Planning Notes:

Prepare dolls with diapers in order to provide one for every group of two to three participants.

## Procedure:

## Check-in (10 minutes)

1. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:
- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

## Caring for my baby - Practice makes perfect (1 hour and 15 minutes)

2. Play relaxing music if possible. Break into groups of two or three participants and provide a doll wearing a diaper to each group. Explain that you will do two exercises: the first is how to change a diaper, and the second is how to properly hold and feed a baby. If possible, try to have one experienced father in each group.
3. First, explain how to change a diaper. Give a demonstration of each of the following steps listed in the 'Baby Care Tips' Handout.
4. Give the groups time to practice. Each person from the group must take a turn.
5. Do the second exercise: Tell the participants that they will practice how to hold and feed a baby properly, using the dolls. Follow the steps listed in the 'Baby Care Tips' Handout.
6. Give the groups time to practice. Each person from the group must take a turn. Proceed to the group discussion.

## Group Discussion

- Did anyone learn anything new, or want to comment on anything you noticed while you were doing this activity?
- Why don't fathers participate more in taking care of young children, particularly babies? What does the Man Box have to do with it?
- How does having a new child in the family affect the couple's relationship?
- Examples: babies cry all the time and require constant attention, and parents become very tired.
- Who has more difficulty providing care for a baby? The mother or the father? Why?
- Can one get angry with the baby? Does your level of emotion differ if your baby is a boy versus a girl? Why or why not?
- Can the father become angry with the mother when there is a disagreement on how to care for a baby?
- What do you do if you get angry? What are the options?
- What are one or two things you can do to be more involved in the caregiving of your child? How will this affect the mother? What are one or two things you can do together with your child?
- How can men support each other in their caregiving roles?

- What are some ways that you can be more responsive to the needs of your young child(ren)?

## Key Messages:

Parenthood can be a very stressful time for many couples. Babies cry and require constant attention and love from both their mother and father. It is important to remember that the best thing to do is to respond to the baby with affection and try to figure out what the baby needs.

The world is changing. Before, parental roles were not flexible: men went to work and women took care of domestic affairs.

Now, however, the only thing men cannot do is breastfeed. The acceptance of men as involved caregivers is growing.

Gender equality includes sharing domestic responsibilities. If both the father and mother work outside the home, they should equally share child care and domestic tasks.

Even for fathers who work outside the home, it is necessary to dedicate at least 30 minutes per day to the baby (including activities such as feeding, bathing, singing, rocking and dressing) in order to develop the emotional connection necessary to form a special relationship with the baby.

If paternity or flexible family leave is offered, encourage men to take those days to spend time with his partner and his child.

The father can respectfully remind individuals who want to place him in a secondary role that it is his responsibility to care for his baby and communicate with him/her.

## Homework and Close (5 minutes)

1. Practice a new way to care for children. For example, if you are in charge of bathing the

baby, take on a new task such as washing the baby's clothes. If you do not know how to perform this task, ask for help. Come prepared to talk about those experiences in the next session.

Do a 'one word' check out that summarizes how they felt about today. Thank everyone for coming and confirm the date, time, and location of the next session.

## Baby Care Tips Handout

Feeding babies, especially during the first months, most commonly falls to the mother, although it certainly does not have to, even if she is breastfeeding. There are many ways fathers can care for children. Here are a few basics.

## How to Change a Diaper

1. Wash your hands with soap and water from a safe water source. Use clean towels to dry your hands.
2. Prepare the changing space. Make sure that you have all necessary materials and that a trash can or garbage bag is within reach.
3. Place the child on the changing area. Do not use safety straps. Always maintain physical contact with the child.
4. Remove the diaper. Use wet towels to clean the child from front to back. Cleaning from back to front can cause infections in girls!
5. Use a clean towel each time you wipe. Throw away any dirty items in the trash bin or garbage bag.
6. Wash your hands with soap and water from a safe water source only if you can  maintain physical contact with the child. Otherwise, use a clean wet towel to clean your hands.
7. Place a clean diaper on the child and dress him/her.

106

## How to Hold and Feed a Baby

1. Always hold the baby's back and head when carrying him/her. The baby's neck is not strong enough to be able to hold the head on its own for approximately the first three months.
2. With one hand, hold the baby's back and with your other hand support the baby's head so that it does not wobble.
3. Once you have the baby in your hands, support all of the baby's body in one of your arms, placing its head on the crease of your forearm while you support below the back with the other hand. When you have acquired enough practice, you can hold the baby with one arm.
4. When preparing to feed the baby, keep the baby's head higher than the rest of the body.
5. You can stand up and even walk around while feeding the baby in the crook of your arm.

## Other Good Tips

Look into your baby's eyes while you are feeding them.  This has been proven to enhance emotional development.

Your baby will be able to feel your closeness when you hold them. Even better when you can provide skin-to-skin contact! This is often done with mothers who have just given birth to babies, and is also an excellent way to promote father-child bonding.

## Supplementary Session: Gender and Toys

## Purpose:

-  To understand how childhood toys and games influence and reinforce stereotypes of the roles and responsibilities of men and womenhild

For Couples

## Key Activities and Time: 1 hour

1. Check-in - 5 minutes
2. Gender and Toys - 45 minutes
3. Close - 5 minutes

## Materials:

- Flip chart paper and markers
- Tape

## Procedure:

## Check-in (5 minutes)

1. Lead a check-in by asking the group one of

two options: 1) to recap what was discussed in the previous session, or 2) to do a more indepth recap using the following questions:

- How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

## Gender and Toys (45 minutes)

2. Divide the group into two smaller groups: men and women.

Tip for facilitators: In any game that requires a division of the participants into groups according to their genders, it is also possible to divide the groups randomly regardless of their gender. The division in terms of gender is simply because men often have similar socialization experiences, as is the case for women.

3. Ask the groups to discuss the following questions about their childhood among themselves/together:
- a. What games did you play?
- b. What toys did you play with?
- c. How were the games played?
- d. What was the objective for each of the games?
- e. Who did they play with?
4. Give each group a piece of flip chart paper and tell them to write down the outputs of their discussion. Give groups approximately 15 minutes for this work.
5. Ask each group to select a representative to present the results of their group discussion to the rest of the participants. Each group has 5 minutes to present.
6. Lead the room in a broader discussion:
- What were the major differences between the games that boys played as children and the ones that girls played as children?
- What do the different types of games teach children (both positives and negatives)?
- Was there an element of violence to the games?
- How do these games/toys shape us in terms of our understanding of the roles men and women are expected to fulfill as adults?
- How do these games 'prepare' boys and girls for the social roles and responsibilities they are expected to fulfill as adults?
- Do these games contribute to gender inequalities between men and women in our society? If so, how?
- Are there games that are the same for boys and girls?
- Are there games that can promote equality among boys and girls?

## Key Messages:

Many girls' games and toys focus on physical beauty, cooking, cleaning, and are contained within the private sphere more than most games or toys for boys.

Many boys' games and toys focus on dominance, violence (i.e., fighting, war, etc.), competition, and are contained within the public sphere more than most games or toys for girls.

Socialization through games and toys may be effective in creating and reinforcing certain norms. This is because children are having fun while they play and the games are often repeated. What we learn at a young age is ingrained in our attitudes and behaviors throughout our adult lives.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

Early Childhood Development

## What is M&amp;E?

Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) is a critical component of Program P-ECD. Monitoring refers to an ongoing, repeated process that generates information to inform decisions about the program while it is being implemented. It is a way to learn about what a program is doing during the program cycle and allows the program team to make any necessary adjustments while the program is ongoing.

Evaluation refers to an event that generates information on the bigger picture or more complex issues after the program has been implemented for a determined period of time. It is a way to learn what changed because of the program and why.

109

## Why is M&amp;E Important?

M&amp;E is a crucial process for learning about how the program is working and showing the program's effectiveness. From the monitoring process, the program team can learn what is working well, how the program is being implemented, and if any challenges or unintended consequences are occurring. If so, monitoring also allows the program team to alter or adjust the implementation plan in order to improve the program.

Evaluation after the program has ended is important to learn if the program was successful in producing the intended change. Evaluation can also reveal how the program improved the lives of participants and if there were any unintended consequences of the program.

5

110

Monitoring and evaluation processes both use pre-designed questionnaires and indicators to measure these aspects. Equimundo and ABAAD

have these materials prepared for M&amp;E of Program P-ECD.

## The Role of the Facilitator in M&amp;E

The facilitator will be responsible for distributing the pre- and post-tests to participants, clearly explaining the purpose of each test and ensuring confidentiality, anonymity, and other ethical considerations outlined below. In the case of adverse events, the facilitator should fill out

## Ethical Considerations

A critical part of creating an M&amp;E plan is a discussion of context-specific ethical considerations, including:

Any data collected must be stored to prioritize participant safety. To ensure that data will be kept confidential, keep paper forms and questionnaires a locked file cabinet at a secure location and ensure any electronic files are password protected. Only the program and evaluation team should have access to the files. Due to the sensitive nature of collecting information about deviant behavior, and the dangers associated with gang involvement, additional precautions above and beyond routine ethical considerations must be taken to guarantee no harm is caused. It is paramount to ensure that ethical guidelines are followed to protect the safety of both participants and the staff providing services or programming. These include: respect for persons, non-maleficence (minimizing harm), beneficence (maximizing benefits), and justice. 46

Informed, voluntary, consent must be obtained for each participant. The informed consent form the Adverse Event Form and submit it to their supervisor immediately.

Facilitators may also fill out Facilitator Feedback Forms after every session (or selected sessions) in order to provide additional information includes information on the study procedures, possible discomforts and risks associated with discussing one's experience with deviant behaviors, as well as the possible benefits of participation, such as an increased knowledge of resources and services beyond Program P-ECD group sessions. Recruiters must be sure to emphasize the voluntary nature of participation, that refusal to participate will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits, and that they are free to leave at any point.

## Glossary of Terms

Care work: Work that is performed to ensure the well-being of others, including care of children, older persons, and ill family members. Often considered of low value and unpaid, referred to as 'unpaid care work'.

Early childhood development: the physical, socio-emotional, cognitive and motor development between 0-8 years of age. These early years are critical, because this is the period in life when the brain develops most rapidly and has a high capacity for change, and the foundation is laid for health and wellbeing throughout life. Nurturing care - defined as care that is provided in a stable environment, that is sensitive to children's health and nutritional needs, with protection from threats, opportunities for early learning, and interactions that are responsive, emotionally supportive and developmentally stimulating - is at the heart of children's potential to develop.

Gender: refers to the way society defines the roles, behaviors, activities and attributes of men, women, boys, and girls. These definitions are not fixed, but change over time and are different from society to society. We learn to be our gender by interacting with the world around us - our friends, family, community, media, etc. Sometimes these ideas of how to be a man or a woman are thought to be based on our biology rather than something that we learn (i.e., the common myth that violence is a part of men's biology). Gender can change over time and intersects with other factors such as race, class, age, sexual orientation, religion, and other social categories, resulting in different levels of privilege or vulnerability for certain groups.

Gender equality: Equality in access, opportunities, responsibilities, and rights among genders; a state of being in which different behaviors, aspirations, and needs of individuals of all gender identities are considered, valued, and favored equally; the concept that all human beings regardless of their sex or gender identity have equal rights and access to opportunities, resources, and are free to develop their personal abilities and make choices without the limitations set by stereotypes, rigid gender roles, or discrimination.

Gender norms: The often-unspoken social rules that govern the attributes and behaviors that are valued and considered acceptable for individuals of a particular gender within a given culture or social group.

Gender roles: Attitudes and behaviors considered acceptable and expected from people according to their actual and/or perceived gender identity.

Masculinity: What it means, in terms of social expectations within a given group or society, to be manly; these definitions vary across and within cultures and communities and change over time, but they are societally determined and policed.

Masculinities: The idea that there is no single, fixed definition of what it means to be manly or what it means to be masculine.

Positive discipline: Positive discipline refers to firm yet kind methods to teach children acceptable and unacceptable behavior, such as praising, rewarding, supporting good behavior, and non-violent responses to misbehavior that take children's cognitive and emotional stage into account, such as natural or logical consequences, time-out or taking breaks, and redirection.

Positive parenting: Positive parenting refers to parental behavior that focuses on creating safe home environments 47  and building a foundation

112

of support and care for children through affection, quality time, praise, and healthy methods of dealing with difficult behavior, such as positive discipline that teaches pro-social behavior. Nurturing parenting involves helping children develop healthy social and emotional behaviors, teaching life skills, and promoting well-being through modeling healthy ways to solve problems and communicate feelings. 48  In short, children do best when their parents: are warm and supportive; spend quality time with them; try to understand their life experiences and behavior; explain the rules they are expected to follow; praise good behavior; react to misbehavior with explanation and, if needed, non-violent punishment such as 'time-out', repairing damage, less pocket money and so forth, rather than with harsh punishment. 49

Sexual violence: Harm or threats of harm caused to a person which are sex-related; any comments or advances, sexual acts or attempts to obtain sexual acts, that are related to sex or sexuality and which are performed or carried out without a person's affirmative or enthusiastic consent.

Shared decision-making: Collectively considering the information and evidence and arriving at a decision that is fair to and agreedupon by the people involved; in a couple setting, shared decision-making occurs when all partners have an equal say in decisions.

Violence against children: All forms of violence against people under 18 years old, including physical violence, maltreatment, bullying, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and emotional/psychological violence, whether perpetrated by parents or other caregivers, peers, romantic partners, or strangers.

Violence against women and girls: Any type of violence inflicted upon women that is rooted in gendered ideas about women's and girls' place or roles in society, as well as attempts to maintain men's dominance and uphold patriarchy.

- 8 Note that these objectives are tied to measureable indicators to assess impact in evaluations (using the Gender-Equitable Men, or GEM, scale). In terms of 'attitude changes' (the first step in the theory of change), evaluations have shown shifts toward more gender-equitable attitudes, as previously noted. In terms of 'behavior changes,' these objectives reflect the most common types of changes in behavior reported across the various Program H impact evaluations: increased condom use, lower rates of self-reported intimate partner violence, lower self-reported rates of sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms, and greater likelihood of contributing to household chores. Evaluations have shown that reported behavior changes tend to reflect the particular focus of the intervention.
