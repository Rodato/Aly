## Preface

Welcome to the Generations for Change curriculum, jointly developed by Equimundo and Terre des hommes Lausanne (Tdh), with support from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).

This innovative program centers a family approach to gender norms, healthy relationships within families, and positive parenting techniques. It engages with both parents and their young adolescents to reduce intergenerational violence and foster healthy, caring, and supportive relationships between parents and their children.

Although complementary methodologies, a separate curriculum is used for each target group (parents and youth), with two sessions together as a family. This youth curriculum is intended to be facilitated separately with boys and girls aged 12 to 14.

This program has largely been adapted from Equimundo's Program H and Program M. Program H was designed for young boys (with H for hombres or homens, the words for men in Spanish and Portuguese, respectively); Program M was designed for young girls (with 'M' for mujeres or mulheres, the words for women in Spanish and Portuguese, respectively). Programs H and M were developed to engage youth in critical reflections on gender and help them build the skills necessary to act in more empowered and equitable ways. These programs have been adapted around the world and have been shown to empower young women to feel a sense of agency and control over their lives and also have been shown to sensitize young men to some of the harmful ways they are socialized and to take on more gender-equitable attitudes.

## Guide to Using the Curriculum

## Activities

Each thematic  unit contains a series of activities that have been sourced from selected training manuals from countries in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia and adapted where necessary. The time needed for each of the activities and the activities' complexity vary to cater to the curriculum's potential use in diverse settings and with different stakeholders.

## Timing

Each activity in the curriculum has a suggested or anticipated length of time. These are general guidelines and can vary considerably based on a number of factors, including the facilitator's comfort with the material, how comfortable the participants are with each other (and thus willing to share), and how talkative the group as a whole is. Use your discretion and experience as a facilitator to adjust the timing as needed to make the group as effective as possible without exceeding the overall time allotted.

## Each session is designed using a standardized format:

<!-- image -->

Objectives: The purpose of each session is indicated. Facilitators can inform participants of the purpose before starting a new session.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Key Activities and Timing: Each activity has a title, which facilitators may choose to share with the group. The activity's recommended length is also indicated but will vary depending on the number of participants and adaptations that facilitators will need to make in relation to the characteristics of the participants and the time available for training sessions/processes.

Materials: The materials required to facilitate the activities are listed. Materials are optional for some activities.

Preparation: These are the steps that facilitators should take, well in advance, to prepare for the activities. These steps should be completed prior to each session to save time and to ensure the activities flow smoothly.

Then, for each activity, there is additionally:

## Each Session Activity

- Key Message(s): The key message(s) of the activity are indicated. These key messages should be emphasized during and upon concluding the activity.
- Procedure: These are the steps for carrying out the activity. They may need some adaptation in different contexts. Facilitators should be attentive to whether the steps are appropriate for the participants they are working with.
- Group Discussion Questions: Most of the activities include group discussion questions to help guide the discussion on the activity topic. These questions serve as guidance for facilitators. It is not usually necessary to discuss all the questions or to adhere to the order in which they are listed, and facilitators can use their best judgment on using them depending on the depth and direction of the conversation among participants.
- Facilitator Notes: These are tips for trainers in relation to specific aspects of the methodology and/or thematic content of the activity that may demand their special attention.

There is also direction about who will be in each session. Boys and girls will be separate for all sessions except the two in which they will be together along with their parents. The facilitation is largely the same for boys' and girls' groups; however, there are some questions specified as 'for boys' or 'for girls.'

## Checking In and Out

Checking in is a good way to start each new training session. It can be as simple as going around the circle and letting each participant briefly say who they are and how they are doing/feeling. Other areas you can cover when checking in are:

- f something new has happened for them since the previous session
- If they have taken any action since the previous session
- One word that describes their state of being
- Their reflection on the discussions so far

Checking out often entails the participants making a concrete commitment to actions they will take before the next session. Checking out-type exercises are already included in many activities, but it is always useful to end a session with participants making a clear commitment to doing something practical before the next session.

In the check-out exercise, you can also do a light debrief of the session to enable participants to share what they most liked (or not) about the activity and what they learned. This is also an opportunity to address any emotions that might still need processing before the end of the session.

## Mindfulness Activity

Most sessions include a mindfulness activity. These activities are to help participants relax and destress and to give them a few moments of peace, acknowledging that everyone arrives carrying daily worries and, at times, difficult situations they are going through in their personal lives. Mindfulness activities can help participants center and open themselves to experience the session through the interaction with others, as well as process the session's activities and the emotions that may have been stirred up. Facilitate these peacefully and quietly to create a calming atmosphere.

## Weekly Commitment

At the close of most sessions, participants will be invited to explore and try carrying out one or more specific actions in line with that week's activities. These actions can help them incorporate the week's learnings into their daily lives and encourage them to share with their partner, children, and community. This is sort of the 'homework' of the curriculum. In the 'Welcome and Check-In' section of each week, participants will be prompted to speak about how they completed their weekly commitment, if they were able.

## Energizers and Icebreakers

Some sessions will also include a prompt for an 'energizer' or 'icebreaker' activity. These are very short activities unrelated to session content in which participants will get up and move around. These activities help to relieve stress and tension, break up sessions with a lot of sitting or discussion, and add an element of physical movement to the session. A number of these activities are included in Appendix A at the back of this curriculum, but facilitators are encouraged to come up with their own if they would like and to modify existing ones to suit their own comfort and that of participants. Think about what you and others might enjoy or what you have done in groups with other facilitators and try those out. You might use a different one each time or find one that the group loves and come back to it regularly. Facilitators are encouraged to use these to help participants feel more comfortable in the space and whenever they feel the energy in the room is getting low.

## Guidance for Facilitators

First and foremost, you should see yourself as a facilitator, not a teacher. Rather than lecturing, ask questions to better understand  where  participants  are  coming  from  and  guide  them  in group reflections to critically look at harmful norms around masculinity. You do not have to be an expert in the topics you are discussing and do not need to have all the answers. Rather, the role of the facilitator is to create an open and respectful environment in which participants can feel comfortable sharing and learning from each other in a safe space.

The  facilitator's  role  is  to  promote  reflection  and  participatory learning, present information neutrally, and create a horizontal learning  experience  in  which  the  participants  can  learn  from each other and from active participation in the activities. Other information to keep in mind includes being aware of your position of power, and accordingly, avoiding judgmental and authoritarian attitudes. Never impose your feelings or opinions on the group  and  do  not  aim  to  instill  fear  because  participants  may 'switch  off'  their  emotions,  interest,  or  engagement  with  the topic or feel paralyzed while participating. Always be conscious of the language you use and messages you present.

Many of the themes in this curriculum are complex and sensitive. During sessions, pay attention to the participants' comfort level. In some cases, you may need to refer individuals to professional services such as counseling. Before you facilitate any session, it is essential that you have a list of available resources for participants should they need additional assistance and that all facilitators are well versed in local laws on minors' rights, confidentiality, and mandatory reporting. It is important to be aware of the practical realities of the group members' lives and understand that they may face challenges or dangers when trying to make changes.

Changing attitudes and behaviors is a long process. Participation in these activities will not necessarily lead to an immediate transformation of individuals' lives and relationships. However, it is a big step toward promoting personal change.

Before  you  begin,  review  your  own  views,  assumptions,  and prejudices,  and  avoid  bringing  them  to  the  group.  Be  aware  if young men or women from particular social, cultural, or religious backgrounds trigger certain emotions in you, be they positive or negative, that may affect your own work in the group.

<!-- image -->

At the same time, there will be moments when it is appropriate  and  helpful  for  you  to  share  your  own  personal  opinions, thoughts, and values about a topic. If the session is discussing a gender-equitable perspective and the group doesn't seem quite on board, sharing your personal views can help open the door for change.

## Asking Questions

One of the most important things you will do as a facilitator is simply  ask  questions.  Doing  so  promotes  dialogue  and  opens new pathways for participants to explore the topics. To do so, see your group as a process. Ask 'process questions,' questions that cause participants to reflect more, cannot be answered with a 'yes' or 'no,' and are unbiased. See the following chart for additional tips:

<!-- image -->

## Yes, Do This!/.notdef

Ask process questions. Examples: 'What do you think about discussing this with your parents or your friends?' 'How do you think the conversation would go?' 'What made you think or feel that way?'

Be simple. Ask, 'When?' 'Where?' 'What?' 'How?' 'Who?' 'Why?' You should continue with a full sentence. Examples: 'What were you thinking when that happened?' 'Why do you think that is?'

Be unbiased. Exclude your own feelings and values from the questions, and instead guide participants in identifying problems and solutions.

<!-- image -->

## Don't, Do This!

Don't ask questions that can be answered with a 'yes' or 'no.' Example: 'Will you discuss this with your friends?'

Don't ask a leading or biased question. Example: 'In order to be a good father when you are older, will you never yell at your children?'

Don't ask too many questions at once. For participants to fully comprehend and answer your prompt, limit yourself to one or two at a time, with probes and follow-ups ready.

Terre des hommes

Helping children worldwide.

There are many group discussion questions listed for each activity to help participants explore and understand the issues at hand. Use these questions as a guide for conversation, though, not a checklist. What is likely to happen is that some of the issues raised by the questions will come up organically in the discussion, in which case there is no need to ask again. Other questions may be answered by someone while they are answering a different question. Sometimes, a group member will ask others a question from the list without even knowing it. All of that is fine.

Overall,  you  want  the  discussion  to  feel  comfortable  and  natural  for  the  participants.  You  may  also  combine  or  reword  the questions to make more sense or to refer to something that was said earlier, which helps the question feel more relevant to the group. Sometimes, if it seems like a question is too sensitive for the group at that time, you may choose to skip it or save it for a future session.

The more you get to know your group and develop your experience as a facilitator, the more comfortable you will feel with the discussion questions. Just remember, the group is not students preparing for a test, and you are not a lecturer. You are a facilitator, and as such, are leading a discussion among friends.

## Tips for Successful Facilitation

The following are a number of useful tips to help you lead the group sessions. These tips will help you to encourage and create a respectful environment in which participants feel comfortable sharing their opinions and experiences, as well as listen to and learn from others.

Remember the group agreements . In Session 1, you will ask participants to decide on a set of agreements. Throughout  the  curriculum  sessions,  remind  them  of  those  agreements. Important group agreements relate to listening to and showing respect for others (e.g., not talking when others are speaking, not making rude comments, or not talking on the phone), confidentiality, and participation.

<!-- image -->

Do not judge. Remember, you are here to facilitate discussion and reflection. Your role is not to teach or punish anyone. Be friendly and create rapport with your participants. Be aware of your own position of power - avoid judgmental and authoritarian attitudes. Never impose your feelings or opinions on the group.

Promote inclusion. Ensure that all participants have the opportunity to speak. Be careful not to let one person dominate the conversation or make other people feel that they cannot share their opinions. Encourage people to share their experiences and learn to identify when people want to speak but may be too shy to say something unless called on. If a participant begins to take over the group by spending too much time with a story, find an opening and kindly say, 'It sounds like you have a lot of valuable experiences to share with the group. That's great! Do others have similar or different stories they would also like to share?'

Address participants' concerns. The group meetings can serve as an important opportunity for participants to receive help and advice. As a facilitator, it is important that you validate people's concerns, but you can also engage the larger group in helping to propose solutions. Ask the group, 'How do you think this problem could be solved?' or 'Has anyone faced a similar situation? What did you do?'

Know and use referral services. Some problems that participants face may require outside support. In addition, some participants may prefer to discuss a particular topic, obtain information, or seek support outside of a group setting, or they may need attention from a specialized service provider. As a facilitator, you should be knowledgeable about places where you can refer participants if needed.

<!-- image -->

Manage conflicts respectfully. If a conflict arises among the  group,  or  if  a  participant  shares  a  discriminatory  view, remind the participants of the group agreements. Encourage other members to help mediate the situation. Ask the group what they think about the question raised or how they would suggest handling the problem. When necessary, you can offer brief responses to questions and clarify misinformation.

Appreciate  honesty  and  openness. Encourage  participants to be honest and open. They should not be afraid to discuss sensitive issues for fear of ridicule from their peers. Thank the group members for sharing their personal stories. Never force anyone to participate in the activities. Instead, try  to  create  an  environment in which the participants feel comfortable.

Promote  movement  and  interaction. Include  as  much physical  movement as possible so that participants remain active, alert, and interested. You are encouraged to use short energizers  between  activities  in  order  to  keep  the  participants engaged in the topics you are discussing.

Manage your time. Keep  track  of  time;  do  not  spend  too long on a given activity or session. Keep in mind participants' attention spans and schedules.

Ask  for  feedback. Use  a  'check-out'  to  receive  regular feedback  from  participants.  What  do  they  like  and  dislike about the activities? What is working or not working? Use their  input  to  improve  the  sessions.  Do  not  divert  from  the planned activities but use feedback to improve the running of the sessions (for example, by including more energizers).

Be  respectful  in  your  presence  and  appearance. Try to be as respectful as possible in your appearance and your nonverbal  and  verbal  presentation.  This  includes  the  way you dress (avoiding clothes that distract) and address participants (work on remembering their names - a simple name game can help with that).

## Be careful of topics that may cause retraumatization.

Given some of these issues' sensitivity, it is possible that participants will bring up personal experiences of sexual trauma or abuse. Given mandatory reporting requirements for facilitators and staff (that is, requirements to report issues such as abuse and sexual assault when the participant is a minor), it is important that at the beginning of each session, you remind participants that they are welcome to leave the room if  they  feel  uncomfortable.  They  are  not  required  to  share any  sensitive  information,  and  for  those  under  18,  you  as the facilitator are required to report instances of abuse. This should be repeated at the beginning of particularly sensitive activities as well.

<!-- image -->

Also remind participants of the resources that are available to them and that you are available after the session to talk further.  Refer  participants  to  service  providers  with  whom they  can  discuss  any  issues  they  may  be  having.  It  is  also helpful to go over the ground rules (group agreements) about respecting confidentiality in the group setting, and the participants should also be reminded not to share any personal information that they do not want to be revealed outside of the group.

Keep  discussions  from  straying  too  far  from  the  key messages . One of the main facilitator tools you can use is the 'bank,' also known as the 'parking lot.' While all discussions are welcome, if a participant brings up a topic that cannot be addressed within the time allotted, write it on a flipchart paper called the 'bank' or 'parking lot.' It is important that these topics are revisited at another time. However, if the topic is completely unrelated, say something like, 'That's a great comment. We don't have time to address that right now, but let's talk more about it after the session.'

## Be friendly and create rapport with your participants.

As a facilitator, you are not an authority figure. You are not sitting  in  judgment or giving participants grades or evaluations. It is fine and even encouraged to joke with participants, call each other by first names, share personal details (as appropriate), and even socialize outside of the group setting. All of that builds the relationships that make the group effective. You are encouraged to share in the group examples from your life and your own struggles, challenges, and realizations. Doing so provides an example for the group and helps them see that change is possible and what the process of change looks like. You do not have to be perfect, just on the same path to personal growth that you are asking the participants to walk.

## Running Each Session

1

Review the session and guidance. Prior to each session, review the 'Materials,' 'Preparation,' and 'Facilitator Notes' sections, as well as the activity procedure. This will help ensure that you are prepared to facilitate each activity and will allow you time to gather additional materials and become more informed on the topic if necessary.

Prepare the space. When preparing the space, always arrange chairs in a circle for all sessions unless otherwise noted. During the sessions, it is recommended to offer participants some type of refreshment and engage them in physical activity and motion. Beverages and food tend to be highly valued by participants and help them stay in the group process.

Check in at the beginning of each session. It is important to begin each session by warmly welcoming back the group and checking in. A check-in provides time for group participants to share any thoughts, personal experiences, and comments they have based on the discussion from the last session. Spend several minutes checking in prior to beginning the day's session. In order to have time for the session activities, keep check-ins brief, without responses or discussion - check-ins shouldn't be more than ten minutes.

Review the group agreements. Most of the sessions will ask group participants to share personal experiences. To create safe spaces for participants, at the beginning of every session, review the ground rules that were established by the group in Session 1. This promotes trust and confidentiality within the group.

Carry out the session - but be flexible and creative and contextualize activities. Each activity contains procedures to take the group through activities and group discussion questions to prompt critical reflection. The structure proposed in this manual for implementing activities should serve as a general guide; it is not necessary to apply it verbatim. Facilitators can change the order of certain activities' elements or alter the listed examples to make them more relevant to their group's reality and to reflect their own knowledge and skills. If the topics and examples presented in these activities come across as too abstract or removed from your reality, you can add in examples from your daily life and experiences. This will help participants to be emotionally involved and identify more closely with the material. Sharing personal experiences also helps to model the behavior you want from the participants in your group. Be careful, though, not to stray too far from the curriculum, as this can prevent you from reaching the sessions' objectives.

Use icebreakers and energizers. Icebreakers are short activities that help participants build trust in the group, usually in a lighthearted way. They are a great way to open a session, allowing participants to move around, share, and become comfortable with one another. Energizers are short activities that are most helpful when the group appears to have low energy, be losing interest, or not be responding to the activity. These help to change the routine, get people in motion, and relieve fatigue and boredom. They take only a few minutes.

Keep group discussions open-ended and among participants. Group discussions can be the most important part of each activity. These discussions are opportunities for participants to reflect on what they've been doing, talk about their thoughts with one another, and think critically about how to see changes in their own lives. It is important for facilitators to make sure that conversations remain open, judgment-free, and comfortable. Try and get the group to talk to one another rather than having one-on-one conversations with whoever is leading the facilitation.

'Check out' at the end of the day. End each day with a one-word 'check-out' that emphasizes some of the key messages or lessons that they learned during that session. Use this time to reflect on the main conclusions of the day, to announce the next activities, or to see what can be improved and what worked well, for example.

## Facilitating Mixed Groups Participant Dynamics

While boys or girls will not be in joint sessions with just each other, there will be a couple of sessions in which boys and girls are together with their parents. These sessions are designed to  engage  participants  in  critical  reflection  and  to  promote dialogue between men and women and their children. Some activities may require men, women, and children to participate in separate group discussions. This is done to make sure that everyone  feels  comfortable  expressing  their  ideas  and  opinions, particularly on issues that may be sensitive to discuss in front of their peers or parents. Through these activities, everyone in the family may begin to feel more comfortable communicating with each other.

Be  aware  of  family  and  gendered  power  dynamics. The  fathers  in  the  group  may  be  used  to speaking on behalf of their partners and children, but in our groups, we want  to  make  sure  everyone  can speak freely.  If  fathers  or  boys  are trying to speak on behalf of women and girls, or interrupting them, gently thank them for their enthusiasm but say that in the group we want to make sure everyone can share their own  stories.  You  can  even  refer back to the group agreement about making 'I' statements - that every participant should speak from their own knowledge and experience and not speak on behalf of others. As  the  facilitator,  you  will  need  to demonstrate  and  model  paying  attention  to  women  and  girls  when they speak as well. Whenever they are talking, look at them and listen carefully  to  what  they  are  saying. If you are looking away or not fully paying  attention,  that  sends  a  signal  to  men  and  boys  that  women and girls' voices are less important.

<!-- image -->

In  mixed sessions, you may see a range of power dynamics  being  exercised,  especially  by  men,  including many of those we are trying to positively shift through the curriculum! In general, all the previously discussed principles apply no matter who is in the group. However, there are a few additional tips that may be helpful:

Pay  particular  attention  to  interruptions  and  side  conversations. In general, men and boys are far  more  likely  to  interrupt  women and girls than the other way around. When men and boys interrupt, step in,  ask  them  to  please  wait,  and then turn your attention back to the original  person  speaking.  This  also applies  when  men  and  boys  interrupt other men and boys. Men and boys  are  often  more  likely  to  have side  conversations  or  take  phone calls when someone else is speaking. When that happens, pause the conversation  and  ask  those  being disruptive  to  stop  and  rejoin  the group.  You  can  also  remind  them about  the  group  agreement  that only one person speaks at a time.

Remember that participants may be  less  willing  to  share  openly  depending  on  who  is  in  the room. For instance, women may be less comfortable speaking freely in front  of  their  spouse,  and  children may  be  less  comfortable  speaking freely in front of one or both of their parents.  When  these  groups  are together,  don't  pressure  individuals to share, but you can give them additional time to think about their answers to the questions or to write down and reflect  on  their  answers without the expectation that those answers  will  be  shared.  Feel  free to  modify  your  approach  in  those activities accordingly based on how you  see  the  participants  responding. Another way to address this is, where appropriate, to break participants into family groups to discuss. Women  and  children  may  be  less comfortable  speaking  about  their spouse or father in the large group but  may  be  able  to  speak  openly when  they  are  just  speaking  with family members or even in a small group with one other family.

## Tips for Creating a Safe Space for Participants and Responding to Sensitive Discussions

Most of the sessions in this curriculum include reflective conversations about possibly sensitive topics. As a facilitator, it's important to foster a safe space for the participants to share their thoughts and emotions. Make sure you are actively and empathetically listening without judging or interrupting the participants' stories. Do not pressure anyone to share, but be sure to allow participants to talk about what the exercise evokes for them, promote reflection, and highlight the key messages of the exercise. If any participant shares any painful experiences, is deeply moved, or cries, you can implement any of the following recommendations as you see fit 1 :

Don't judge. This isn't always easy, but set aside your own opinions to focus on the other person's perspective. Recognizing the participant's views and emotions will help them feel heard and understood. This doesn't mean you have to agree with everything the person says - it's about letting them know you care.

Give the person your full attention. Pay attention with your gaze, your body language, and a warm tone of voice. Maintain eye contact, nodding and giving other cues as appropriate to show you are paying attention, without interrupting. Giving your full attention shows respect, and a person is more likely to remain calm when they feel respected.

Listen carefully (feelings and facts). Actively listen to the words and experiences participants describe - as well as the emotions reflected in their tone of voice, body language, and other cues - to go beyond words and identify emotions. Listen with your heart, gaze, voice, and ears.

Don't be afraid of silence. Sometimes, all a person needs is to be heard or to know you are there. The person may be thinking about what they are going to say next or may need a few moments of silence to restrain their emotions. Let the person finish speaking before offering a few words of support.

Say thank you. Expressappreciation for the participants' openness and confidence in sharing their experiences or for being vulnerable. Comment that many of us have had painful experiences with our parents and being able to recognize them can help heal.

Consider sitting next to the distressed person. You can hold their hand or rest your hand on their back if appropriate in the context, or you can ask the person if they want to go out and get some air and accompany them if there is a second facilitator.

Repeat and paraphrase. Ask questions to confirm and validate experiences that have been shared. Refer to the person's words: For example, 'I heard that Ahmed felt humiliated when his father insulted him. Is that right?' Keep a respectful and nonjudgmental attitude and give the person time to respond. Remember that there is no script for empathic listening. Respond based on the person, the situation, and the moment.

Resist the temptation to give advice. Limit yourself to listening, validating the experience, being grateful for it having been shared, and looking for common ground with the other participants.

Follow up. Between sessions or at the beginning or end of the next session, approach the participant who had been emotionally affected, ask how they have been, and suggest other times to meet if necessary or consider offering information about psychological support services if they are still distressed. (See the following guidance on responding to disclosures.)

## Responding to Disclosures Related to Violence or Mental Health

During a session, if a participant discloses a painful life experience, you can sit with the participant and ask them if they wish to share their experience. Be sure to avoid pressuring the participant to disclose. Ensure that the group listens with attention and extreme respect.

At the end of the session, you can reach out to the participant and ask how they are feeling, validating their experience and feelings. You can also ask whether they would like support and offer to connect them with specialized services.

Some problems that participants may be facing, such as mental health issues, substance abuse, or violence, may require outside support. In addition, some participants may prefer to discuss a particular concern, obtain information, or seek support outside of a group setting, or they may need attention from a specialized service provider. As a facilitator, you should be knowledgeable of, and always consult, the Tdh referral protocol to ensure you do not put the person at risk and inform your Tdh supervisor if you are unsure of how to handle a particular problem.

Use the following guidelines  to  respond  to  disclosures  of  violence or other sensitive issues that might require external, specialist services. Please always consult with a Tdh supervisor and use the specific Tdh protocol.

It is important to establish if the participant is currently at risk of violence or if this is a story of past violence. If the incident of violence was recent or it seems like they are still at risk, consult with the relevant Tdh protocol for referrals. If the incident of violence was in the past, practicing empathy and active listening is very important to ensure the participant feels heard and validated.

## If a participant reveals that they have experienced or are experiencing violence, it is important to follow these steps:

Listen with empathy, validate their experiences and concerns, and be sensitive.

Become familiar with the resources available locally and have a printed copy available with the names and contact information of centers that offer specialized services for survivors of violence. Consult the relevant Tdh protocol on how to properly refer someone without placing them at risk.

If the person is interested in working with specialized services, give them the relevant information and inform your contact at the local center that a participant will be looking for help or information.

Show the participant that you care and your concern for their feelings.

Do all you can to help the person feel calm, supported, and connected to others.

Evaluate if there is a current or ongoing risk of extreme violence.

Discuss the case with your supervisor.

At the end of the session, sit with the person and ask them how they are doing. You can also suggest the group support the person. In the next session, ask how they fared after the session and during the week.

If the disclosure of violence occurred within the larger group, carefully remind the group of the agreements on re- spect and confidentiality.

Terre des hommes

Helping children worldwide.

## Actions to avoid when working with a participant who discloses violence:

- Attempting to solve their problems
- Convincing them to leave the violent relationship
- Convincing them to go to the police or to court
- Asking detailed questions that force them to relive painful experiences
- Asking them to analyze what happened and why
- Pressuring them to reveal their feelings
- Blaming them for the violence
- Disrespecting their agency and choice

These actions can do more harm than good. 2

Boys' groups should not be considered an appropriate place to share details about acts of violence against women. This could reinforce patriarchal ideas that legitimize violence. In such cases, the focus should be on how to manage anger and violence, on the harm that can be caused, on men taking responsibility for their actions, and on ensuring that potential survivors are not in danger.

## If a participant reports severe mental health issues:

If a participant requires specialist support, having disclosed suicidal thoughts or demonstrated severe depression during a session, acknowledge this disclosure in the moment and create a plan to talk individually with the participant. When the session ends, give them information on where they might go to seek support and discuss the case with your supervisor. Remember that facilitators are not the participants' counselors or therapists.

## Materials:

- Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)
- Pens/pencils and sheets of paper
- A ball to throw for the Name Game

## Preparation:

Before the first group session, it is important that you as a facilitator understand the difference between a traditional teaching style (in which  the  teacher  or  facilitator  is  above  the participants)  and  the  group  education  facilitation style (in which the facilitator and group members are equals).

Make  sure  that  you  have  your  materials  together.

Arrange the space so that it is inviting and equitable. There should be no desks or tables if possible,  and  chairs  should  be  arranged  in  a circle. The facilitator's chair should be part of the circle. There can be a break in the circle to place the flipchart easel or to put flipchart papers on the wall. Consider having music in the background as participants arrive if that helps to create a pleasant atmosphere.

## (20 minutes) Part 1: Welcome and the Name Game

1. Warmly welcome participants to the group as they arrive and introduce yourself. If there are snacks or drinks available, encourage them to go ahead and take something.

2.  Thank  them  for  coming  and  record  each  person's  name and information on the intake sheet/attendance log. Consider asking them to write a name tag for others to learn their names on the first day.

3.  Once everyone has arrived (or enough time has passed), ask participants to sit down, thank them for their interest in participating, and tell the group:

'Welcome and thank you for coming! We are very happy that you accepted our invitation to participate in this group meeting. The purpose of this group is to create a space for young people like yourselves to meet, discuss, and learn from each other.'

'This program was designed by Terre des hommes Lausanne (Tdh) and Equimundo. Throughout this program, you all will go through a variety of topics about how to stay healthy and happy as you get older - like communication, dealing with stress and other emotions, and having healthy relationships with those around you.'

'We  know  being  teenagers  can  be  hard  sometimes.  This group is meant to provide you with some tools and support to make that transition a little easier. During our meetings, we will discuss how we can all work together to grow up as respectful and responsible men and women.'

4.  Now,  explain  that  you  would  like  everyone  to  introduce themselves  to  the  group.  Ask  participants  to  stand  up  and explain that you are going to play the Name Game.

5. In the first round, have each person say their name before throwing  the  ball.  So,  one  by  one,  each  participant  should say their name and then throw the ball to someone else. (You can begin in order to demonstrate the game.) This round ends when everyone has had a chance to say their name and the ball has been passed back to you as the facilitator. Repeat the game for the second round, but this time, after a participant  says  their  name,  they  should  put  their  hand  on  their head to signal that they have already gone. Continue the second round until everyone has spoken.

Facilitator  Note:  Use  your  own  notebook  or  a  piece  of paper (not the flipchart) to write down the names of participants and any information about them after they introduce themselves. This will help you remember who they are and details about them more quickly.

6. After each participant has introduced themselves, tell the group:

'Over the next few months, we will meet once per week for a total of 13 meetings. Each session will have a different topic, and sessions will include interactive activities and group discussion. This group is not a class or a lecture, and no grades will be given. We are all equal here, and though there will be some sessions where we as the facilitators share information, most of our time spent together will involve discussions where we all share our thoughts, opinions, and life experiences and seek to support each other.'

7. Ask the group if they have any questions about the group sessions.

<!-- image -->

1.  Explain  that  the  group  will  discuss  many  topics  that  are personal and potentially sensitive, such as family and friends, relationships, and violence. To discuss such issues, it is important to create a safe, respectful, and comfortable space for members of the group to talk freely about such personal and sensitive subjects.  Ask:  'What  agreements would help you to  feel  safe  and  comfortable  discussing  and  sharing  in this group?'

Facilitator Note: You should write down the list of agreements on a flipchart paper. Remember that these need to be visible in every session. The following box lists several recommended agreements. If these are not mentioned first by the group members, recommend that they be included.

1. Put up two flipchart papers on opposite sides of the room

## Important Group Agreements for a Successful Group

- Respect the right of others to have different opinions.*
- Let others finish speaking before you speak.*
- Maintain confidentiality. What is said in the group stays in the group.*
- Use 'put-ups,' not put-downs. (Support others and encourage them rather than being demeaning or unkind.)
- Don't use jokes that are harmful or hurtful to others.
- Don't generalize about people.
- Talk about 'some' instead of 'all.'
- Use 'I' statements - own your opinions.
- Everyone should participate.
- All members of the group are equal.
- Commit to attending all the sessions and to being on time.

*Make sure this is included in the final agreement.

2. After a list of agreements is created, ask: 'Is there anything missing that you would like to add?' Make any additions to the flipchart list that are suggested.

3. After the list is complete, ask all group members: 'Does everyone  agree  to  this  list  and  commit  to  upholding  these agreements during our sessions?'

Facilitator  Note:  If  someone  does  not  want  to  commit, ask him or her why. Ask the group: 'Are there alternative  agreements that you would feel more comfortable with?'  Suggest  that  the  agreement  be  changed  or  removed, depending on the desires of the group.

4. Thank participants for their help in making the group safe, respectful, and comfortable. Explain that it is up to everyone in the group to maintain the group agreements. Say that if a participant sees their peers not upholding an agreement, the participant should remind them of the group agreements so the group can stay on track.

Share the Key Message: 'Creating group agreements will  help  everyone  to  feel  comfortable,  safe,  and  respected within this group. The agreements will remain in place for the duration of the group sessions. It is everyone's responsibility to follow them and encourage others to follow them.'

## Part 3: Energizer

(5 minutes)

Select an energizer or icebreaker from the back of the curriculum (Appendix A), or use one you like, to help participants get to know each other and get comfortable in the space.

## Part 4: Sharing Expectations

(20 minutes)

1. Put up two flipchart papers on opposite sides of the room (if possible). Write at the top of one 'Hopes and Excitement' and at the top of the other 'Concerns and Fears.'

2.  Ask  participants  to  think  for  a  few  minutes  about  their hopes or things they are excited about, and their concerns or fears, regarding the group. Put out markers and ask them to go to one and then the other, in any order, to share expectations for the group sessions.
3. After a few minutes, read the 'Hopes and Excitement' paper  and  ask  if  anyone  has  any  comments  or  anything  they wrote  they  would  like  to  elaborate  on.  Then,  do  the  same with the 'Concerns and Fears' paper.
4. Once you have discussed, mention some of the hopes and things they are excited about that you believe will be met by the group, and note any that you don't think the group will be able  to  meet  for  whatever  reason.  Then,  address  concerns and fears, alleviating as many as you can. If there are any that require one-on-one follow-up after the group, ask whoever wrote it to speak with you or another facilitator privately after the session.

Thank the group for sharing, and provide the Key Message: 'Sharing our hopes and excitement is an important  first  step  toward  making  positive  changes  in  our lives and relationships. Through our discussion, we can develop  realistic  expectations  of  what  will  be  accomplished during our time together. Knowing each other's desires for this group will also enable us to better learn and support each other.'

Facilitator Note: It is likely that there will be some expectations or topics that will not be covered during the group sessions. To set realistic expectations, explain to the  group  that  although  some  of  their  expectations  or desires may not be directly discussed during the group meetings, we will address as many as possible and see how they connect to topics we do cover.

## Part 5: Program Topics

(10 minutes)

1. Tell participants: 'This program will cover some, but probably not all, of the topics you raised and your expectations. Some of the key things we will cover include…'

- 'We will discuss what it means to be young men and young women in our society today, some of the challenges you face, and your strengths that you can use to overcome those challenges.'
- 'As people get older, especially in our teenage years, our bodies and minds change, and as a result, how we interact with other people changes, too. We will discuss what some of those changes are, how they affect us, and how we  can  improve  our  understanding  of  those  changes  so they are not as disruptive to our lives. Some topics that we will discuss include expressing our emotions, dealing with anger and conflict, and the effects of violence on our lives.'
-  'We  will  talk  about  and  develop  skills  -  especially around communication and conflict resolution - that will help us understand ourselves and our families better and help us interact with them better.'
- 'Finally, we will talk about the future. As young people, the future can seem very far away sometimes - and maybe even hopeless at times, depending on the problems we face. But we will talk about what we want and need, what challenges we may face, and how to achieve our visions for a better life.'

Part 6: (Optional) Case Managers Explain Referral Services

<!-- image -->

## Part 7: Me and My Family in Five Years (15 minutes)

Facilitator Note: For this activity, we are asking participants to imagine themselves five years in the future. This may bring a sense of hopelessness or anger depending on the situation. You can modify the activity to have participants think about one year in the future instead. The purpose of this activity remains the same: to envision the types of relationships they would like to have with their families and what needs to change in order to achieve those goals.

1. Pass out a pen or pencil and a sheet of paper to each participant.
2. Explain: 'In this activity, each of you will think about the goals you have for yourself and your family.'
3. Ask the participants to close their eyes. Read the following statements aloud slowly so that the group members can consider each sentence as you read it.

## 'Imagine it is five years from now…'

o 'What do you want your life to be like at that time? What do you hope to be doing? How might it be different and better than your life today?'

o'What do you hope your relationships with your parents and your siblings look like? Your relationships with your friends?'

4.  Ask  the  participants  to  keep  their  eyes  closed  and  think about this vision for the future and what it looks like.
5.  After  a  few  minutes,  ask  the  participants  to  write  down and/or draw their vision for themselves and their family. They can spread out around the room if they don't want to keep sitting where they are.
6. After everyone has had a few minutes to write, ask everyone to come back to the circle.

## Ask the group:

- How did it feel to develop a vision for your life?
-  What  kind  of  help  do  you  need  from  your  family  to achieve  that  vision?  What  things  may  be  blocking  the path?

Part 8: Closing and Check-Out

7. After the questions, ask if anyone wants to share their vision with the group. Allow enough time for participants who want to share to do so. Remember, sharing is not required.
8.  Thank  the  participants  for  sharing  their  experiences  and ideas. Tell them we will return to this vision later during the program.

4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.

5. Explain that the session is ending and that each meeting will end with a 'check-out,' in which participants will have an opportunity to reflect on what has been discussed.

## Ask the group:

- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any final questions?
- Are you looking forward to our future meetings?
6. Tell the participants that at the end of each session, the facilitator will be asking them to do something at home to bring the lessons we learn in the group to their families, called a 'Weekly Commitment.' For  this  week's  session,  ask  the participants to speak with their parents about their personal or  family  vision.  Tell  the  participants  that  the  next  session will start with a conversation about how your conversations went.
7. After finishing with the questions confirm the time, date, and place of the next session.

2. Explain that at the beginning of each session, there will be a 'check-in,' in which participants will have an opportunity to share how they are and any feedback they have had since the last meeting. Explain that sharing is voluntary and is not required if someone does not feel comfortable or want to do so.

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session?

Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

Did anyone have an opportunity to talk with their families about their personal or family visions? How did that go?

3. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## Part 2: What Is Gender?

(45 minutes)

Facilitator Note: When discussing how to define 'man' and  'woman,'  it's  important  to  note  the  terminology used by the participants. If you realize that some of the participants are shy to use some words, initiate by making  some  suggestions  yourself.  It  would  also  be  wise to go through the issues of using derogatory terms that some participants might use to express their thoughts.

1.  Draw  two  columns  on  a  flipchart  paper.  In  the  first  one, write 'Sex'; in the second, write 'Gender.'
2. Say to the participants: 'Today, we are going to talk about the difference between sex and gender and what that means for us as we get older. These roles and expectations are related to gender. On the other hand, we have certain biological characteristics  as  men  and  women  that  are  related  to  our sex.  While we are born with biological characteristics that determine our sex, many of the differences we attribute to girls and boys or men and women are taught to us. We learn them as we grow up because everyone in our society expects us to behave in a certain way according to our gender. These expectations  or  gender  roles  can  limit  girls'  and  boys'  opportunities  in  life  in  different  ways.  However,  expectations about how girls and boys should behave are not fixed; they are defined by society and have changed throughout history. It  is  important for us to define for ourselves what it means to be men and women, girls and boys, and to question the stereotypes - rigid ideas - that are harmful and limit people's lives. We are going to play a short game to see if you can tell the difference.'
3. Pass out the cards you made before the session. Ask the participants  to  place  their  card  on  the  side  of  the  flipchart paper where they think it belongs - sex or gender.
4. Give the participants 2 minutes to decide which side of the flipchart paper their card belongs on.

<!-- image -->

5. After the participants have placed their cards on the flipchart  paper,  review  each  characteristic  and  provide  a  brief description of why it is either related to sex or gender.

| Statement                                           | Gender or Sex   | Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| a) Men growing beards                               | Sex             | Facial hair (and hair on other parts of our bodies) is biological and deter- mined by your sex. Even if women tried, it is impossible for them to grow a beard like a man.                                                                                                             |
| b) Women giving birth to children                   | Sex             | Giving birth is a biological, reproductive function of women and, therefore, is related to sex. Men don't have the correct body parts to give birth to a child.                                                                                                                        |
| c) Men caring for children                          | Gender          | Although giving birth is related to sex, raising or caring for children can be done by both men and women and, therefore, is related to gender.                                                                                                                                        |
| d) Women wearing hijabs                             | Gender          | Although we don't see men wearing hijabs, the clothes that are acceptable for men and women to wear are not biological. It's similar to the fact that most men don't wear shorts - only boys do.                                                                                       |
| e) Men going out alone after sunset                 | Gender          | The acceptability of men going out at night more than women is related to social rules (gender) and not someone's biology (sex).                                                                                                                                                       |
| f) Women cleaning the house and cooking             | Gender          | Roles and responsibilities for working in the house are related to some- one's gender. Both men and women are able to cook and clean; our society just tells us this is more of a role for women.                                                                                      |
| g) Men being the financial providers for the family | Gender          | It's common in our society that men are the financial providers for the fami- ly, but this doesn't need to be the case. Many women play this role around the world. It is related to social gender roles and not biological sex.                                                       |
| h) Women breastfeed- ing babies                     | Sex             | Only women have breasts that produce milk - men cannot even if they try. Therefore, the role of women breastfeeding a baby is based on their sex characteristics of having breasts with milk.                                                                                          |
| i) Men having deeper voices                         | Sex             | Biologically, men have deeper voices than women. This relates to sex. However, commonly, women speak in softer and quieter tones to not chal- lenge authority. This is related to gender.                                                                                              |
| j) Men having penises                               | Sex             | People's reproductive organs are related to their sex.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| k) Women being less powerful than men               | Gender          | Physical strength and social power are different things. Men are generally physically stronger (can have bigger muscles), and that relates to biology and sex characteristics. However, social power and authority are defined by gender norms and how much we value women in society. |

Part 3: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through

6. Reiterate that in general, the biological/physiological differences that do not apply to both (breasts, facial hair, etc.) are related to sex. Social/behavioral differences that are not necessarily distinct between men and women are related to gender. This distinction is important because there are some natural differences between men and women (sex) that can't change, but a lot of what we believe is different about men and women is based on culture and traditions (gender), which can change.

7. Ask the participants if they have any questions about the examples on the flipchart papers or the concepts of sex and gender.  Explain  to  them  that  we  will  be  exploring  gender more in the next session, so if they can't think of questions now, they can ask them next time.

8. Tell participants: 'As you get older and move from childhood into adulthood, your bodies and minds begin to change to help prepare you to be an adult. This is normal and expected, but also can be surprising and sometimes challenging for young people.'

9.  Use  the  following  Group  Discussion  Questions  to  facilitate a conversation regarding changes occurring in their lives right now:

- On the sex side of the flipchart paper (biological), what are  some  of  the  changes  boys  experience  as  they  become adults? What changes do girls experience? (Facilitator Note: Use the diagram at the end of the session to assist.)
- On the gender side, how do those changes affect the roles  that  boys  and  girls  are  supposed  to  play  in  their family? Do your roles and responsibilities change? Are you treated differently by your parents, siblings, or other relatives? Is this fair?
- How could this be limiting for boys and girls in terms of what they are able to do as they grow older? Is there anything you would like to do that you can't?
-  What  are  some  hard  things  about  becoming  older? What are some benefits of  these  changes  you  are  experiencing?

10. If  the  participants are struggling with physical changes during adolescence, cover some of the basics of puberty and body changes during adolescence, with a focus on hygiene and health.

<!-- image -->

## Share the Key Messages:

- 'Throughout our lives, we receive messages from family, friends, and media about how we are expected to behave as men and women and how to treat other women and other men. Even though there are some differences between men and women, it's  important  to  know  that many of these differences stem from society alone and are not related to any biological or natural factors. These differences  affect  men  and  women  and  their  relationships on a daily basis. For instance, men are expected to always be strong and dominant in their relationships with others, including their partners. Women are expected to be submissive to the man's authority.'

· 'Adolescence and growing up are full of changes to our bodies, our minds, and how people treat us. It's important to speak with an adult if you're unsure about anything happening to your body and to remember that it's important to be aware of changes to your mood and emotions. Things may sometimes feel unnatural or weird, but just know you are not alone in this and everyone goes through a wide range of changes during this time in their lives.'

## Part 3: Mindfulness Activity

## (5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Active Listening. During this exercise, they will be concentrating fully on one song.

2. Pick a song and have it ready to play on a phone or speakers.

3. Ask the participants to close their eyes and listen closely to the music.

4. Explain that they should follow the lyrics, notice the different  instruments,  or  take  in  the  song  as  a  whole  experience. If they have heard the song before, they should listen for something they haven't ever noticed before: What are the new sounds and lyrics that you are hearing? What are they trying to tell you?

5. Play the music.

## Ask the group:

- What did you think about what we discussed today?

3. Tell participants the Weekly Commitment: 'Before we meet next week, I'd like you to continue thinking about our discussion today and try to repeat the mindfulness activity that we did today - pick a song or music and focus all of your attention on it. Notice something you haven't heard before.'
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5.  Confirm  the  time,  date,  and  place  of  the  next  session  if there are any changes.

Welcome and Check-In Act Like a Man, Act Like a Woman Mindfulness Activity Closing and Check-Out

Part 1: Welcome and Check-In

(10 minutes)

Part 2: Act Like a Man, Act Like a Woman (60 minutes)

1 Thank all the narticinants for comina.

## Part 1: Welcome and Check-In

(10 minutes)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session?

Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

2. Ask participants, 'Did anyone think during the last week about my closing questions, thinking about and writing down two things you like about being a girl or boy (whichever you are) and thinking about and writing down one or two things you would like to do but you cannot because you are a girl or boy? What did you write down?'

3. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

Facilitator Note: You can use check-ins as an opportunity to gently remind participants of the group agreements. For example, if one of the agreements was to be respectful,  encourage  everyone  to  listen  while  the  others  are speaking. This can include practicing empathy by trying to imagine themselves in the other person's position and not judging their ideas or experiences.

## Part 2: Act Like a Man, Act Like a Woman (60 minutes)

Facilitator Note: Part 2 ('Act Like a Man, Act Like a Woman') could be seen as trying to 'redefine' what it means to be a man or woman. Depending on the participants' views,  this  could  create  backlash  under  the  argument that the program is trying to disrupt natural, religious, or cultural doctrine.

<!-- image -->

The  questions  toward  the  end  of  the  exercise  about the consequences of staying in the Man Box or Woman Box might elicit such comments. It will be important to continuously assess the group to see their comfort level with  the  conversation  and  to  what  extent  you  can  explicitly challenge current gender stereotypes and roles. The  remainder  of  the  curriculum  will  implicitly  foster this conversation, so if the group does not want to discuss  changing  norms,  this  exercise  can  be  used  as  an introductory reflection on the socially assigned roles and characteristics of men and women.

If  you  receive  backlash  to  gender  equality,  especially  from boys,  you  might  want  to  explicitly  address  the  benefits  of gender equality. You can ask the following questions, which might elicit responses on the negative effects of gender discrimination and the positive impact of gender equality - particularly for men and boys:

## What is the harm that women face from gender inequality?

2. How are men benefiting from gender inequality?
3. What is the cost to men of gender inequality?
4. How would women benefit from equality?
5. How would men benefit from equality?

For  the  last  question,  here  are  some  possible  answers  to draw from:

- Reduced stress and burden on the man - specifically, relieving psychological stress through shared decision-making (men may be described as 'clothes hangers' that take on the burden of everyone's problems)
- Dual income leading to economic stability and growth for the family structure
- Healthier relationships with family members and modeling gender-equitable behavior while raising children
- Peace and prosperity at the society and community levels (commonly, Rwanda is discussed as an example of where gender  equality  in  parliament  has  led  to  a  stronger  and safer  society  and  economy),  not  only  the  individual-level benefits
- Communal and long-term benefits for the family and society versus individual, selfish, and short-sighted benefits for the man
1.  Ask  the  participants  if  someone has ever told them that they are 'acting like a man' or that they should 'act like a man.' Ask them to tell the other participants about what happened when someone told them this or something similar.

2. After the participant shares his or her story, ask: 'Why do you think this person told you that? What did you feel after?' Tell  the  participants that we will go deeper into these two questions. This will allow us to know how society makes it difficult to be male or female.

3.  Write  the  phrase  'Act  Like  a  Man'  on  a  flipchart  paper with  big  letters,  and  ask  the  participants  to  say  what  this phrase  means  to  them.  What  are  society's  expectations  of what a man or young man should be like and how he should behave? How should men feel and react?

4. After participants have given many answers (ideally 20 or more), draw a square box around the participants' answers.

Facilitator Note: Some of the possible answers include 'be  strong'  and  'don't  cry.'  Answers  to  this  question often  relate  to  physical  strength,  repressing  emotions (except anger), wielding power over oneself and others, having  high  status,  and  achieving  in  areas  like  sports, making money, and professionally. You may need to remind participants that the list should focus on larger social messages about what it means to act like a man, and not so much their personal opinion.

5.  After  you  have  finished  the  'Act  Like  a  Man'  list,  move to another flipchart paper and write the phrase 'Act Like a Woman/Girl/Lady'  (use  whatever  term  is  most  commonly used  for  sanctioning  youth).  Ask  the  participants  to  state what this phrase means to them and if they have heard it said to others or to themselves. What are society's expectations of what a woman should be and behave like and how they should react and feel?

6. After participants have given many answers (ideally 20 or more), draw a square box around the participants' answers.

Facilitator  Note:  Some  possible  answers  are  'be  a housewife' and 'don't be too aggressive.' Answers to this question often relate to physical attractiveness, displaying emotions, deferring to men, motherhood, humility, and acting in socially appropriate ways in terms of not displaying sexuality.

<!-- image -->

## After the participants are done with their suggestions, start the discussion using the Group Discussion Questions:

- Which of these statements - 'Act like a man' or 'Act like a woman' - is more harmful? Why?
- How does living and abiding by what's written in the box affect the lives and well-being of men? How does it affect the lives and well-being of women?
- What are some of the positive characteristics you see on each of these lists?
- Are those positive characteristics truly specific to men or women or can both men and women be those things?
- What advantages do men and women get from staying inside the box?
- What are some costs of living outside of the Man Box or Woman Box?
- How does living and abiding by what's written in the box limit and influence a boy or man's life and relationships? How does what's written in the box influence and limit a girl or woman's life?
- What happens to boys and men who step outside of this box (i.e., living outside what is written in the box)? What are the advantages of doing so?
- What happens to girls and women who step outside of the box and do not abide by gender roles? What do people say about them? How are they treated? What are some advantages of stepping outside the box?
- Can you think of examples of men or women in your life whom you admire who sometimes do not conform to the messages inside the box?
- What are some ways that you already do, or would like to,  step  outside  of  the  confines  of  this  box?  (Probe  for those who responded to share what happens when they step outside expected behavior - benefits and costs.)

7.  Optional  step:  Divide  the  participants  into  small  groups and  ask  them  to  act  out  a  short  scene  (1  or  2  minutes)  in which a person tells another to 'act like a man' or 'act like a woman/respectful lady.'

Share the Key Message: 'The  aim  of  this  activity  is to help clarify how society places different rules on how men and women are expected to behave. These rules are known  as  'gender  roles'  because  they  dictate  what  is 'normal' for a man to think, feel, and behave and what is 'normal' for a woman.

Part 4: Closing and Check-Out

Part 3: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through

1. Thank all participants for sharing today.

In many cases, these roles - as we will discuss in the coming activities - might place additional limitations on men and women to keep them inside the boxes of 'act like  a  man'  and  'act  like  a  woman,'  in  addition  to  the consequences  related  to  decision-making  and  private relations. These identities are based on a set of beliefs communicated  by  parents,  families,  media,  peers,  and other members of society that pressure men to be a certain way. However, all young men and women, like you - and adult men and women as well - have the right to be who they are and to act in the ways that are true to themselves, regardless of what their gender is.'

## Part 3: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Deep Breathing.
2. Ask everyone to get in a comfortable position either standing, sitting in a chair, on the floor, or lying down.
3. Ask the group to close their eyes and focus their attention on their  breath,  particularly  on  inhaling  and  exhaling.  They should observe how the breath enters and leaves the body. Ask the group to notice what happens to their stomachs as they are breathing - you want the stomach to expand as you inhale more air and contract as you exhale it.
4. Tell them to breathe in slowly through their nose for 3 seconds, hold for 1 second, and breathe out through their mouth for 4 seconds. Do this several times until they feel relaxed (about five times).
5.  Explain  to  the  group  that  deep  breathing  helps  to  calm, relax,  and  focus.  If  they  are  ever  feeling  strong  emotions -  fear,  anxiety,  nervousness,  anger  -  taking  a  few  deep breaths, and focusing on one's breathing, can help. This type of deep breathing increases the amount of oxygen that enters the bloodstream and improves the functions of nerves that control the heart rate, which can reduce anger, anxiety, and stress.

## Part 4: Closing and Check-Out

(5 minutes)

1. Thank all participants for sharing today.

## Ask the group:

- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
2. After finishing with the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
3.  Tell  participants  the  Weekly  Commitment:  'Before  we meet next week, I'd like you to continue thinking about our discussion today and do the following: (1) Think about and write  down  two  things  you  like  about  being  a  girl  or  boy (whichever you are), and (2) Think about and write down one or two things you would like to do but you cannot because you are a girl or boy.'
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5.  Confirm  the  time,  date,  and  place  of  the  next  session  if there are any changes.

## Part 1: Welcome and Check-In

(10 minutes)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session?

Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

2. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## Part 2: What Is Power?

(30 minutes)

1. Explain to the group that in this activity, they are going to explore what power is and how it impacts the lives of young men and women.
2. Ask the group: 'What does 'power' mean to you?' Allow the participants to share their ideas and opinions.
3. Next, ask the participants to close their eyes and think of a time they felt powerless.
4. After a minute, ask the participants (still with their eyes closed) to think of a time they felt powerful.
5. After a minute, tell the participants to open their eyes. Tell the  group  that  they  will  now  have  an  opportunity  to  share some of their experiences. It is an important opportunity to remind the participants of the ground rules, particularly on confidentiality  and  empathy,  but  also  of  the  importance  of participation.
6. Ask the group: 'How does it feel to be powerful?' Allow the  participants  to  share  how  being  powerful  feels.  Ask  if anyone would like to share their experience with the group or explain what situations make us feel powerful. Sharing is not required, only voluntary.

<!-- image -->

## Generations for Change - Youth Curriculum

7. Next, ask the group: 'How does it feel to be powerless?' Allow the participants to share how being powerless feels. Ask if anyone would like to share their experience with the group or explain what situations make us feel powerless.

Facilitator  Note:  The  following  information  can  help  to explain feelings of being powerful or powerless.

Feeling powerful can feel like being:

- In control
- Big
- Knowledgeable
- Strong
- Brave
- Happy

Feeling powerless can feel like being:

- Small
- Fearful
- Without any control
- Unwanted
- Not confident
- Sad
8. After the group has shared different examples, explain that power can be positive or negative depending on a person's own experience.
9.  Explain  to  the  group  that  there  are  four  types  of power. Read out the names of the four types of power (if available, you can write the four types of power on a flipchart paper):
- Power over
- Power to
- Power with
- Power within
10.  Ask  the  participants  to  share  their  ideas  about what  each  of  the  four  types  of  power  means,  and where possible, to provide an example.
11. After the group has had a chance to share their ideas and examples, read the definitions of each type of power to the group:

Power over: The power that one person or group uses to control another person or group. An example would be the  power  that  the  culture has  given  a  man,  which  he uses to control the members of his family.

Terre des hommes

Helping children worldwide.

Part 3: People and Things

(30 minutes)

1. Divide the participants into two groups; have each group

Power  to: The  beliefs  and actions  that  individuals  and groups use to create positive change.  This  kind  of  power  is  behind  the  concept  of empowerment.  'Power  to' enables a person to gain control  over  his  or  her  life. An  example  would  be  an individual  teaching  another community member about how to grow products, such as mushrooms.

Power  within: The  power that  lives  within  an  individual. It is a personal strength and uniqueness based on self-acceptance  and  self-respect, which in turn extends to respect for others and acceptance of others as equals. It  is  different  than  'power to'  in  that  it  refers  to  individuals  finding  strength  and positive change within themselves, while 'power to' refers  to  strength  and  change for other individuals.

Power with: The power that we have when two or more people  come  together  to  do something  that  they  could not do alone (power together). This is a collective sense of empowerment through organizing  and  uniting  for  a common purpose or common understanding. 'Power with' is experienced when a group comes  together  to  work  to tackle common problems, such  as  access  to  water  or creating community centers.

Thank  the  volunteers  for  sharing  and  then  ask some of the Group Discussion Questions:

- In what ways are men powerful in society?
- In what ways are women powerful in society?
- Where do young people your age fit in? Do you ever feel like you have any power, and if so, when? Is it different for boys compared to girls?
- How might children feel powerless? How can parents help their children feel less powerless?
-  Who  normally  has  power  in  society?  Who  normally does not have power?
- Is there a difference in how men use power and how women use power?
- What are some of the ways that our society promotes or  supports  relationships  in  which  some  people  have power over other people?
- Are there times when power and authority are exercised over us by institutions or groups of people rather than by individuals (such as in healthcare, education, or policing)? How does that affect us?
- How can people work together to generate more positive uses of power?

<!-- image -->

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the Key Message: 'Power has many different faces and meanings. Power often exists in relationship to other people. We are constantly moving in and out of situations and relationships where we have more or less power. Sometimes, we use power in ways that are harmful to those around us, and sometimes, other people use their power in ways that are harmful to us. However, each of us has the ability to use power in positive ways. We can work together to make positive  changes  that  can  help  to  develop  our  families and communities.'

## Part 3: People and Things

(30 minutes)

1. Divide the participants into two groups; have each group form a line, with the two lines facing each another across an imaginary boundary. Each side should have the same number of participants, and each participant should have a partner.
2. Tell the participants that the name of this activity is 'People and Things.' Randomly choose one group to be 'things' and one group to be 'people.'
3. Read the following directions to the group:
-  'Things:  You  cannot  think,  talk,  or  make  decisions.  You have to do what the 'people' tell you to do.
- 'People: You can think, talk, and make decisions. Furthermore, you can tell the 'things' what to do while standing in the line. You cannot make someone move from their line. For example, you can tell someone to clap or wave their hands or sit on the ground.'

Facilitator Note: It might be helpful to ask for two volunteers to first act out for the group how a 'person' might treat a 'thing' or give an example such as, 'A 'person' can request that a 'thing' jog in place' or, 'A 'person' can request that a 'thing' conduct all activities with one hand behind their back.'

4.  Ask  the  'people'  to  begin  the  activity,  instructing  them that  they  can  order  the  'things'  to  do  any  kind  of  activity. (Alternatively, the 'people' can direct the 'things' with hand gestures, using their hands to show they must move ahead or back, move up and down or jump, or move to one side or twirl around.)

5. Give the group 2 minutes for the 'things' to carry out the designated roles. Make sure they have enough time to really experience it.

Finally,  ask  the  participants  to  go  back  to  their places in  the  room,  and  use  the  following  Group Discussion Questions to facilitate a discussion:

-  For  the  'things,'  how  did  your  'people'  treat  you? What did you feel? Why? Would you have liked to have been treated differently?
- ·For the 'people,' how did you treat your 'things'? How did it feel to treat someone as an object?
- Why did the 'things' obey the instructions given by the 'people'?
- Can you think of relationships in our daily lives where someone treats another person like a 'thing'?
-  In  your  daily  life,  do  you  treat  others  like  'things'? Who? Why?
- Why do people treat each other like this?
- What are the consequences of a relationship in which one person treats another like a 'thing'?
- How can power or using power be positive? That is, what are some positive ways we can use power?
- Are there particular groups in society who tend to have more power than others? (See if they can link or think about  the  ways  that  being  a  refugee,  poor,  or  a  member of a minority group can bar access to power or privilege, how being identified as a man can give them space where peers are not allowed, etc.)
- How can this activity help you think about and perhaps make changes in your own relationships?

## Share the Key Messages:

-  'There  are  many  different  types  of  relationships  in which one person might have power over another.'
- 'As you discuss relationships between men and women, it is important to remember the connection between how you might feel oppressed - or treated like objects in some of your relationships and how you, in turn, might treat others (including women) like objects.'
- 'Thinking about these connections can help motivate you to construct more equitable relationships with girls in your homes and communities.'
- For girls group only: 'In society, there are also times in which girls and women could have power over others, so these are still important things to keep in mind as you interact with others.'

## Part 4: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Senses. During this activity, you will be giving them a raisin (or piece of candy) and guiding them  through  their  senses  while  giving  the  object  all  their attention.
2. Give the participants a raisin (or piece of candy).
3. Read the script:

<!-- image -->

Holding: First, take a raisin and hold it in the palm of your hand or between your finger and thumb.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

(If in a wrapper) Hearing: Unwrap the candy and listen very carefully to the sounds it makes as you take it off. Try to block out all of the other sounds you may be hearing in the room.

Seeing: Take time to really focus on it; gaze at the raisin with care and full attention-imagine that you've just dropped in from Mars and have never seen an object like this before in your life. Let your eyes explore every  part  of  it,  examining  the  highlights  where  the light shines, the darker hollows, the folds and ridges, and any asymmetries or unique features.

Touching: Turn  the  raisin  over  between your fingers, exploring  its  texture.  Maybe  do  this  with  your  eyes closed if that enhances your sense of touch.

Smelling: Hold  the  raisin  beneath  your  nose.  With each inhalation, take in any smell, aroma, or fragrance that may arise. As you do this, notice anything interesting that may be happening in your mouth or stomach.

Placing: Now slowly bring the raisin up to your lips, noticing how your hand and arm know exactly how and where  to  position  it.  Gently  place  the  raisin  in  your mouth; without chewing, noticing how it gets into your mouth in the first place. Spend a few moments focusing on the sensations of having it in your mouth, exploring it with your tongue.

Part 5: Closing and Check-Out

(5 minutes)

1. Thank all participants for sharina todav.

<!-- image -->

Tasting: When you are ready, prepare to chew the raisin, noticing how and where it needs to be for chewing. Then, very consciously, take one or two bites into it and notice  what  happens  in  the  aftermath,  experiencing any waves of taste that emanate from it as you continue chewing. Without swallowing yet, notice the bare sensations of taste and texture in your mouth and how these may change over time, moment by moment. Also pay attention to any changes in the object itself.

<!-- image -->

Swallowing: When you feel ready to swallow the raisin, see if you can first detect the intention to swallow as it comes up, so that even this is experienced consciously before you actually swallow the raisin.

Following: Finally, see if you can feel what is left of the raisin moving down into your stomach, and sense how your body as a whole is feeling after you have completed this exercise. 3

## Part 5: Closing and Check-Out

2. After finishing with the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
3. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
4.  Tell  participants  the  Weekly  Commitment:  'Before  we meet next week, I'd like you to continue thinking about our discussion  today  and  try  to  use  'power  with'  one  time  between now and the next session. Remember that this is one way to use power in a positive way to work with someone to achieve a common goal. I'll ask about your experiences at the beginning of next session.'
5.  Confirm  the  time,  date,  and  place  of  the  next  session  if there are any changes.

## Resource Page 4.1: Understanding Power

Some types of power exist in relation to other people or resources: We have (or do not have) power in relation to another person or group that has more, less, or the same power we do. It is a relationship. For example, this includes a teacher and student or a parent and child.

Power is not fixed: It is not something biological that we are born with (that is, it is not inherent to us but is constructed based  on  circumstance,  community,  and  context)  or  something that we always have all the time. We are constantly moving in and out of situations and relationships in which we have more or less power - for example, a woman who is a supervisor at work has power over her employees, but she may not have the same level of power at home with her husband.

Power can lead to positive and negative feelings: We often feel positive and in control when we are feeling more powerful, and we have negative feelings when we are feeling less powerful. This affects our ability to influence and take action in a situation.

There are different types of power, which can be used in different ways. These are:

## Power over

To have control over someone or a situation in a negative way, usually associated with repression, force, corruption, discrimination,  and  abuse.  This  involves  'taking  power' from someone else and then using it to dominate and prevent others from taking it - a win-lose situation.

## Power with

To have power on the basis of collective strength and/or numbers - to have power with people or groups, to find common  ground  among  different  interests,  and  to  build a common goal to benefit all those in the collective. This power multiplies individual talents and knowledge and is based on support, solidarity, and collaboration.

<!-- image -->

## Power to

The ability  to  shape  and  influence  one's  life.  It  refers  to having the ideas, knowledge, skills, money, and ability to convince yourself and others to do something. When many people have this kind of power, it can also create 'power with.'

## Power within

A person's feelings of self-worth and self-knowledge. This is  related  to  people's  ability  to  imagine  a  better  life  for themselves and to have hope and the sense that they can change the world - the feeling that they have rights as human beings. It involves having a sense of self-confidence and a feeling that they have value because they exist.

-  Pens  or  pencils  and  paper  for  writing  or drawing
- Hat or bucket
- Resource Page 5.1 ('Violence Scenarios')

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Preparation:

Before the session, think about what information  is  largely  known/accepted  by  the  local community regarding violence, taking into consideration the current laws and services available for people who use violence or are victims of  it.  Coordinate  with  your  supervisor  on  the proper response if you discover that a participant might require referral if you discover they are suffering from violence or abuse.

On  the  flipchart  paper,  write  the  types  of  violence  and  their  definitions  that  will  be  discussed in the activity. Cover these definitions with another piece of paper so the participants do not see them until you show them later.

- There  are  many  scenarios  provided,  but  you will only use three or four in the activity. Read them  all  beforehand  and  select  those  that seem  most  appropriate  for  your  group  based on their cultural context, maturity, knowledge, etc.

A  case  manager  should  be  available  for  this session  in  case  any  young  people  need  any referrals.

2. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.
1.  Hand  out  paper  and  a  pen/pencil  to  each  of  the  participants.
2. Ask the group: 'What is violence?' Give them 5 minutes to write down as much as they want to answer that question; give them the option to draw a picture if they would prefer. Then, go around and ask participants to share some of what they wrote or drew, and write those ideas down on a flipchart paper. If participants identify general types of violence, such as 'physical,' ask them for specific examples of this.
3.  After  everyone  has  shared,  explain  to  the  group:  'At  its simplest level, violence is the way for one individual to have control or power over another person. Violence causes emotional, physical, or other forms of harm, and it is destructive and  damaging  to  both  the  victim  and  the  perpetrator.  Violence is not a random act; it happens in specific circumstances and settings. Violence happens more frequently in some settings than others, such as during periods of conflict, but it  is  also  very  present  in  our  homes  and  communities.  Violence often occurs within the family and is often perpetrated by men against women and by parents against children, although these are not the only types of violence. Many people think they can use violence to deal with or solve a problem but, in reality, it only creates many more problems.'

4. Continue by saying: 'Most often, this violence targets individuals or groups that have less power in our communities. Many people fall into these categories. Children and young people  are  vulnerable  because  they  have  fewer  rights  and are dependent on adults in their lives for food, shelter, and security. Refugees or displaced people also do because they are away from their homes, are limited in actions they can take (such as moving about the country or working), and are sometimes  confined  to  camps.  Women  also  usually  fit  in these categories because they have fewer rights than men and are often discriminated against because of their gender.'

5.  Tell  the  group  that  acts  of  violence  can  be  divided  into several  broad  categories.  Unveil  the  definitions  of  violence to the group:

- Physical violence: Using physical force, such as hitting, beating, slapping, kicking, burning, or pushing.
- Emotional or psychological violence: Often the most difficult form of violence to identify. It may include humiliating, bullying, threatening, insulting, pressuring, and expressing  jealousy  or  possessiveness  (such  as  controlling decisions  and  activities).  It  can  also  include  restricting someone's movements. This form of violence can be verbal or nonverbal.
- Sexual violence: Pressuring or forcing someone to perform sexual acts (from kissing to sex) against their will or making sexual comments that make someone feel humiliated or uncomfortable. It does not matter if the person has previously consented to sexual behavior - consent must be given at the time.
- Economic  violence: When  someone  else  exercises complete  control  over  a  person's  money  and  other  economic resources. This type of violence is a way of exerting power and can be used to control someone's movements: for example, keeping them from meeting friends.
6.  Select  and  read  four  to  six  of  the  violence  scenarios  on Resource Page 5.1. After you read each one, ask participants: 'Is this a form of violence? What kind or kinds of violence are we seeing?'

## After reading and discussing some of the violence scenarios,  ask  the  following  Group  Discussion Questions:

-  What  kinds  of  violence  are  young  people  your  age most likely to experience? Why?
-  What  are  the  kinds  of  violence  that  occur  in  relationships between men and women? What causes this violence?  (The  examples  can  include  physical  violence and emotional or sexual violence that a man exercises against  a  friend/girlfriend/wife,  in  addition  to  violence used by women against her friends or partner.)
-  What  are  the  types  of  violence  common  within  the family?  What  causes  this  violence?  (Examples  may  include  physical/emotional/sexual  violence  used  by  parents against their children or other forms among family members.)
- What are the types of violence that occur outside the boundaries  of  family  or  romantic  relationships?  What causes this violence? (Examples can include physical violence among men related to gangs, war, rape, emotional violence, and stigma against some individuals or groups in the community.)
- Are there types of violence that relate to a person's gender? What kinds of violence are used against women?
-  Are  only  men  violent,  or  can  women  be  violent  as well?  What is  the  most  common type of violence men use against others? What is the most common type of violence women use against others?
- Does any man or woman ever 'deserve' to be beaten or to suffer from violence? (Facilitator Note: The answer to this question is always 'no,' but it is asked here to explore participants' understandings and experiences of violence being used as a punishment or revenge. Make sure you reinforce that no one ever 'deserves' to experience violence.)
- What are the negative outcomes of using violence on girls? Boys? What are the impacts on families? Communities?
- What are some actions you can sometimes take to protect yourself from violence? (Examples: Say 'no' even if you know the person, run away from the violent situation and tell a trusted adult, and shout for help.)
- What are some actions you can take to help someone if you think they are being harmed?

<!-- image -->

## Share the Key Messages:

- 'At its most basic level, violence is a way to control or have power over another person. People often only think about violence as physical aggression, but there are other forms of violence as well.'
-  'Violence  is  a  violation  of  a  person's  human  rights, whether it is enacted against women, men, or children. According to official data and statistics at the global, regional, and national levels, women are disproportionately affected by intimate partner violence, while the perpetrators of this type of violence as well as other types of crimes and violence (such as murders and sexual violence outside the home) are overwhelmingly men.'
- 'It is widely assumed that violence is a 'normal' and 'natural'  part  of  being  a  man.  However,  violence  is  a learned behavior and not innate; thus, it can be eliminated. As we discussed in other sessions, men are mostly brought up to repress their emotions, with anger being the  sole  emotion  they  can  express  without  affecting their masculine image. Additionally, sometimes men are raised to believe that they have the right to expect certain things from women and that they have the right to abuse women physically and verbally if they do not comply with the men's expectations.'

## Part 3: Seeking Help

(10 minutes)

1. Tell participants: 'When you or someone you know is experiencing violence, it's always important to talk to someone you trust to seek help or support. Take a moment and write down on your sheet of paper five people who you could talk to for help or support if you, or someone you know, were experiencing violence.'
2. Give everyone 5 minutes to complete their list.
3. After everyone has made their list, introduce the case manager and ask them to speak for a minute about resource and referral options for young people.

3. Have them open their eyes and write what they are thankful for on a small piece of paper (or notecard) without their name.
4. Collect these papers in a hat or bucket and read them aloud to the group.
5.  Thank  the  group  for  their  vulnerability  and  sharing  what they are thankful for.

## Resource Page 5.1: Violence Scenarios

Several  scenarios  are  available  to  use  with  participants. Please read through each before the training and choose scenarios that you feel will be the most relevant and sensitive to the community in which you are working. These can include other types of violence occurring in school settings, like bullying or physical punishment in schools, or types of violence in camp settings, such as a camp manager requesting sexual favors in exchange for food/benefits.

The list of scenarios includes several involving sexual, physical, and emotional violence exercised by men/boys toward women/girls  in  relationships;  men  exercising  physical  violence toward women and girls outside of intimate relationships; and community and institutional violence against individuals or a group of individuals. When necessary, you can adjust these scenarios to address other types of violence that may occur between couples, within families, and in the local community.

1.  A  man returns home from work very hungry after a long day. When he arrives, he finds that his wife has not prepared food, and he hits her in anger.

2. A teacher sees a child misbehaving and starts shouting at him using discriminatory language, calling him no better than an animal.

3. An older boy is sexually harassing a young girl who is walking to school, whistling at her, calling her names, and telling her to come and talk to him.

4. A father tells his 14-year-old daughter that she will have to stop going to school because he has found someone for her to marry.

5. A boy comes home very late after school because he was hanging out with his friends, and his parents slap him repeatedly when he gets home.

6. A boy from a large family says dismissively to a boy from a small family, 'You have no family tree and no ancestors. You have nothing.'

7. A young person starts calling someone else in school an insulting nickname based on part of their real name. Soon, everyone starts calling them by the insulting nickname.
8. A husband angrily confronts his wife because she visited a  male  doctor  to  see  about  a  medical  condition  and  he  is jealous.
9.  A  husband controls the movements of his wife. Anytime she wants to leave the house (for instance, to go to the market,  work,  or  see  her  family),  he  demands  she  ask  his  permission.

10. A 12-year-old who lives with their uncle is removed from school and made to work, and they are not allowed to keep any of the money.

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session?

Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?

2. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## Part 2: Empathy Clothesline

(50 minutes)

Facilitator Note:

- While it is critical with every session to remind young people about the limits of confidentiality and to review the ground rules, this activity asks young people to think more deeply about their  exposure  to  violence  and  violence they may have perpetrated. Participants should be reminded that the discussion is anonymous; they should not put their names on the sheets. Remind young people that they do not need to disclose anything.
- When we talk about abuse, violence, and hurting people, we tend to only think of physical aggression, but it is important to think about other forms of violence. It is also essential to help young people think about the violence that they use because very often we think others are violent but never ourselves.
- If possible, facilitation should be done with someone who  has  been  trained  in  supporting  survivors  so  that young people have an identified person to talk to if they would like. The content of this activity is very sensitive, and it is possible that young people may not feel comfortable during the discussion. They should be allowed to excuse themselves if they wish. All young people should be given - and reminded how to use - resources relevant to interpersonal violence at the end of the session, with physical copies of those resources handed out to them.
1. Explain that the activity today will continue earlier discussions about violence and how it affects us, our families and communities, and society.
2. Give four sheets of paper or notecards to each participant.
3. Ask each participant to think for a while about things they may have seen or heard and to write a short response to each of the four categories on the clotheslines. Each person should write at least one reply for each clothesline (or category). Allow about 10 minutes for this task. Explain that they should not write much, just a few words or a phrase. Remind them not to put their names on the cards. Also tell participants that this activity is not only focused on physical violence; violence can  include  hurtful  things  that  we  have  said  or  have  been said to us, for instance.
4.  Ask  the  participants  to  place  their  cards  facedown  on  a table  at  the  front  of  the  room,  with  one  stack  for  each  of the four categories on the clotheslines. Shuffle the cards and begin to place them on the different clotheslines for each of the four categories.

<!-- image -->

5. After all replies are on the clotheslines, allow the group to walk around and read all of the responses. Then, ask the following Group Discussion Questions:

- How do we feel when someone uses violence against us?
- How do we feel when we do or say something that hurts another person?
- What role do the 'Man Box' and the 'Woman Box' play in who uses violence in our society and who experiences violence?
- What are the consequences for people who are experiencing violence?
-  How  does  the  media  (music,  radio,  movies,  pornography,  etc.)  portray  some  of  the  violence  we've  talked about?
- What role do you think you could play in preventing cycles of violence in your family, among your peers, and in your community?
- What are ways to heal this pain? What can you do to help someone who has been hurt? How does it feel to help others?
- What have you learned in this activity to help overcome violence?

6.  After  you  have  asked  the  discussion  questions,  ask  the group what it was like for them to talk about violence and abuse they may have seen, heard, or experienced.
7. If anyone in the group shows a need for special attention from something said during the discussion, ensure that you as  the  facilitator  check  in  with  them  after  the  session  and ask  how  they  feel,  explaining  that  today's  topic  is  difficult and that you see they are upset/sad. Offer to bring them to meet with one of the site leads, who can support them (at the agency where the program is being held) and help them make sense  of  the  strong  feelings  they  are  experiencing.  Ensure the young person knows where to get help, consider referring them to appropriate services, and discuss the issue with other senior staff at your organization (see the introduction to these sessions). Facilitators should adhere to mandatory reporting requirements as specified by their agency or organization.

## Share the Key Messages:

- 'There are many ways that people can be hurtful toward others. This can include physical as well as verbal and emotional ways of hurting each other. Hurting others in these ways is a form of violence.'
-  'Violence  is  often  passed  from  person  to  person. Someone who has been hurt is more likely to hurt others later because of the pain they feel. This does not mean that  violence  will  definitely  take  place,  but  just  that  it might. Recognizing the hurt and finding support for pain are some of the ways to stop this from happening. Using our power to treat others with respect and care, and to support those who have been harmed, is another way to prevent harm and help those that are experiencing it.'
- 'We have the opportunity here to break the cycle of violence  that  we  experience  and  to  prevent  that  cycle from passing on to others.'

## Part 3: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Drawing What You Feel. During this exercise, they'll try to channel their emotions into a short drawing activity.
2. Give each person a piece of paper and a pen/pencil.
3. Tell the participants to take 30 seconds to do some deep breathing exercises and concentrate on how they are feeling.
4. Have the participants take the next 3 or 4 minutes to draw something that reflects how they are feeling at the moment on their pieces of paper. This doesn't need to be a fancy or well-drawn picture. They don't need to share with the larger group.

## Part 4: Closing and Check-Out

(5 minutes)

1. Thank all participants for sharing today.

## Ask the group:

- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
2. After finishing with the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
3. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
4.  Tell  participants  the  Weekly  Commitment:  'Before  we meet next week, I'd like you to continue thinking about our discussion today about empathy and try and put yourself in someone else's shoes. If you are having a disagreement or argument,  try  to  see  the  other  person's  point  of  view  and understand where they are coming from. We will talk about your experiences next week.'
5.  Confirm  the  time,  date,  and  place  of  the  next  session  if there are any changes.

## Part 2: My Parents' Legacy

(55 minutes)

1. Ask everyone to close their eyes and think about something fun they enjoy doing with their father. It could be anything they want, whether it is playing a sport together, watching TV, running errands, or something else. If they do not have or do not know their father, ask them to think about any important male figure in their life, such as a grandfather, uncle, older brother, or teacher.

2. Tell the group to spend a minute thinking about the time they spend with this man. What about those times do they enjoy and why?

7. Repeat the process, but ask about participants' mothers: Ask everyone to close their eyes and think about something fun they enjoy doing with their mother. It could be anything they  want,  whether  it  is  cooking  or  working  around  the house,  watching  TV,  running  errands,  or  something  else.  If they do not have or do not know their mother, ask them to think about any important female figure in their life, such as a grandmother, aunt, older sister, or teacher.

8. Tell the group to spend a minute thinking about the time they spend with this woman. What about those times do they enjoy and why?
9. After 2 minutes, tell everyone to open their eyes. Ask for volunteers  to  share  briefly  about  the  time  they  spend  with their mother or female caregiver.

## Bring the group back together and lead a discussion  with  the  following  Group  Discussion  Questions:

- What are the positive things about your relationship with your parents that you value? Why are those things important to you?
-  In  a  lot  of  households,  we  hear  things  like,  'Men should  not  cry'  and  'Men  should  raise  sons  to  be tough.' How do you think this affects our fathers? How do you think it affects the way they have cared for us?
-  How  do  you  think  these  beliefs  have  affected  our mothers?
- How is your life today different than your father's and mother's  when  they  were  your  age?  What  are  some challenges they faced that you do not? What are some challenges you face that they did not and may have trouble understanding?

Facilitator Note: In refugee camp settings, pay particular attention  to  differences  in  generational  situations  and how that will play into the answers to this question (i.e., growing up in a refugee camp setting versus the 'normal' life their parents may have experienced).

## Share the Key Messages:

- 'Who we are today was shaped by our experiences growing  up,  both  positive  and  negative.  They  can,  but do not have to, determine who we will become in the future. Reflecting on our own past enables us to recognize the  values  and  positive  attitudes  we  want  to  continue living and also to make positive choices for the future by replacing negative attitudes and behaviors with positive ones.'
- 'When you're enduring unpleasant experiences - such as violence, bullying, and other problems young people deal with - it's important to talk to your parents about it or reach out for help to other adults who can help you. Remember the five people that you thought of two weeks ago. There are more adults who want to, and can, help you than you may realize.'

## Part 3: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Self-Massage.

2. Ask the participants to bring their hands together and use one thumb to rub the other hand. Continue this for 30 seconds, and then have them switch hands.

3. Now, have them bring their hands to their shoulders and rub their shoulders to relieve some of the tension. Continue this for 30 seconds.
4. Bring their attention to their necks. Have them bring their hands to the back of their necks and rub in a circular motion for 30 seconds.
5.  Lastly,  have  them  bring  their  hands  to  the  sides  of  their heads by their foreheads (temples). Have them gently rub in a circular motion for 30 seconds.
6. Have them take three long, deep breaths.

## Part 4: Closing and Check-Out

That is, during early adolescence, children's emotions might be stronger and change more frequently. This is a function of a part of the brain that regulates anger and other emotions called the prefrontal cortex. Because the prefrontal  cortex  isn't  fully  developed  until  after  adolescence, youth  may  not  fully  understand  what  a  certain  feeling is or why they feel it, and they may not fully be able to regulate how they express themselves.

1.  Remind  participants  that  a  few  weeks  ago,  you  talked about violence and its negative impacts. Say that in this session, they will talk about emotions and their connections with violence.

## Ask participants:

- How do you know when you are sad (e.g., my energy feels low, I don't feel like going outside)?
- How do you know when you are happy (e.g., I am smiling, I feel like I can do anything)?

2.  Explain:  'As  you  turn  into  adults,  feeling  moody  or  depressed one moment and happy the next is normal. However, this does not mean that your emotions have complete control over you. One emotion that often feels like it takes control of  us  is  anger.  Anger  is  a  natural  and  normal  emotion  that every human being feels at some point in life. However, many people confuse anger with violence. Violence is a behavior, one way that some people express anger. But there are many other ways to express anger - more positive ways - than violence. It is important to learn how to express our anger rather than allowing it to build up inside us. When we allow anger to build up, we tend to explode. Additionally, healthier ways of expressing anger can lead to better results.'

3. Explain to the group that you will now talk about how to react to anger.

4. Ask participants to relax and close their eyes. Say: 'Think of a situation when you were angry. It could be with a parent or with a friend. What happened? Don't say it out loud. Just think  about  it.'  Give  them  a  few  minutes  to  think  silently. Optional: Pass out sheets of paper and pens/pencils to everyone in the group. Ask that they write one or two sentences about a situation in which they felt angry.

5.  Next,  say,  'In  this  situation,  try  to  remember  what  you were thinking and feeling.' Optional: Alternatively, they can write down one or two feelings they felt when they were angry.

6.  Say  the  following:  'Very  often,  after  we  feel  angry,  we begin to react with violence. This can happen before we even realize that we are angry. Some men and women react immediately: shouting, throwing something on the floor, hitting something  or  someone.  Sometimes,  we  can  even  become depressed and silent. Think about the incident when you felt angry. How did you demonstrate this anger? How did you behave?' Optional:  They  can  write  a  sentence  or  a  few words about how they reacted.

7. Divide participants into groups of four or five people each at the most. Ask them to share what they wrote or thought about in the group. Allow 10 minutes for the group sharing.
8. Ask each group to brainstorm realistic and positive ways of reacting when we are angry with a parent, sibling, or friend. Give them 10 minutes to brainstorm.
9. Ask each group to present their answers.

Part 3: Communicating With My

Family (35 minutes)

1. Introduce this activity by saving: "Communication be-

10. Use the box 'Positive Ways to React When I Am Angry' to give additional suggestions on how to resolve conflicts when we are angry.

## Positive Ways to React When I Am Angry

## Get Help From Others

Ask someone or a small group of people you trust to listen to the reasons you are angry and help come up with solutions to deal with these difficult emotions.

## Get Some Fresh Air

Getting some fresh air is simply getting out of the situation of conflict and away from the person who is making you angry. You can count to ten, breathe deeply, take a walk, or do some kind of physical activity, trying to cool down and stay calm. You should also explain to the other person that you will go outside to get some fresh air because you are feeling angry. For example, 'I'm really angry, and I need to get some fresh air. I need to do something like go for a walk so I don't feel violent or start shouting. When I've cooled down, we can talk things over.'

## Use Words Without Offending

To use words without offending is to learn how to express two things: to say to the other person why you are upset and to say what you want from the other person without offending or insulting. For example, 'I am angry with you because…' and 'I would like you to…'

## Part 3: Communicating With My Family (35 minutes)

1.  Introduce  this  activity  by  saying:  'Communication  between parents and their children is often challenging for both groups. Children want to assert their independence, try new things, be curious and explore, and do things they enjoy. All of that is perfectly normal developmentally. Parents, on the other hand, worry that children will get hurt or end up in a dangerous situation, will accidentally hurt someone else, or will end up with problems at school or in the community. They are doing what they feel is best, but their children often see it as unfair, overly restrictive, or simply not making any sense.'

2. Split participants into three small groups. Hand out the Resource Page 8.1 ('Communicating With My Parents'), and assign each group a section of the handout to read (what, how, and when) and summarize for the larger group.

3. Have each group read their section aloud until all tips are covered.

Facilitator  Note:  For  low-literacy  groups,  the  facilitator should convey the information on the resource page in a digestible and interactive way.

4. Continue: 'In the following scenarios, I want you all to pretend to be a parent. Talk about how you would feel about this situation and how you would deal with it - as a parent. Then, try to imagine what you would want your parents to say if you were the young person in trouble. Try to think of positive solutions to the problems in each scenario that everyone would be happy, or at least satisfied, with.'

5.  Split  the  participants  into  three  groups  and  assign  each group one of the following scenarios. Ask them to act out the scenario in two ways - the first having poor communication between the  parent  and  child  and  the  second  having  good communication  between  the  parent  and  child.  Give  them  7 minutes to brainstorm their two role-plays.

- You are playing with one of your new toys and your parent tells you that you need to stop playing and help clean around the house. You are annoyed because you feel like you never have time to play.
- You have missed a couple of assignments in school, and your teacher sends home a note for your parents about it. Your parent gets mad at you and blames you for not doing your homework. You're now angry at them for yelling at you and telling you what to do.
- You have been spending a little bit of time after school with someone of the opposite sex you like. One day, your younger sibling accidentally tells your parents about it, and they want you to stop. You're frustrated at your sibling for telling your parents.

6. One by one, have each group present their two role-plays. After each group presents, ask the other participants: Do you agree with how the solution was presented? Is there anything else you would suggest doing to communicate well?

## After all groups have presented, ask the following Group Discussion Questions:

- What do you think about the list? Do you think some of the suggestions would really work? Which ones and why?

Part 5: Closing and Check-Out

Part 4: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

(5 minutes)

1. Thank all participants for sharing todav.

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through

- Can you think of any situations in your life now where using some of these might help you communicate with your parents?
-  Are  there  any  suggestions  that  you  think  would  not work as well? Why not?
- Are there any people you can look to as role models to learn from about how we communicate with others and express our emotions like anger in healthy ways?
-  Do  you  wish  you  were  better  able  to  express  some emotions? Do you wish others in your family expressed their emotions differently?
- What can you do to express your feelings more openly? How can you be more flexible in expressing what you're feeling?

## Share the Key Messages:

-  'Different  emotions  reflect  different  needs,  and  it's best  to  learn  how  to  recognize,  understand,  accept, and  handle  our  emotions  in  our  daily  lives.  The  ability to express emotions without causing harm to others can make us stronger and helps us deal better with the world around us.'
- 'Even though you are not responsible for what you feel, you are responsible for how you act and handle your emotions. It is important to differentiate between 'emotion' and 'behavior' and to work hard at expressing emotions without causing harm to ourselves and to others.'

## Part 4: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Shake It Out; this is a good exercise to do when you're feeling stressed and helps to release built-up emotions.
2. Ask everyone to stand (if they can; otherwise, it is okay to do this exercise in a chair or seated position, too!). Explain that you will be calling out a body part that the group will need to shake out however they want to. Each body part is going to get 10 seconds of shaking, and then you'll move on to the next one.

## 3. Read the script:

- 'Start with your feet. Shake your left foot! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Next, your right foot! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Now, move that shake up the whole of your left leg. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Next, your right leg. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Now, shake out your right arm. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Then, your left arm. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Now, move that shaking feeling up and down the whole of your body. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
4.  After  a  minute  is  up,  get  everyone  to  stop,  take  a  deep breath, and let their breathing return to normal.
5. Thank the participants for their participation. Remind them that they can do this at home at any point there are feelings that they want to get out of their system.

## Part 5: Closing and Check-Out

(5 minutes)

1. Thank all participants for sharing today.

## Ask the group:

- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
2. After finishing with the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
3. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
4.  Tell  participants  the  Weekly  Commitment:  'Before  we meet next week, I'd like you to continue thinking about our discussion today and practice one of the healthy strategies we talked  about  to  deal  with  anger.  Remember,  this  could be something like taking deep breaths, communicating clearly  about  how  you  feel  in  the  situation,  or  walking  away  to cool off before saying something. We can talk about how it worked out for you next session.'
5.  Confirm  the  time,  date,  and  place  of  the  next  session  if there are any changes.
