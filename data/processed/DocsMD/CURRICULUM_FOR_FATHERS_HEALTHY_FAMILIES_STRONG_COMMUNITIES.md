<!-- image -->

WELCOME  TO  THE  PROGRAM  P  CURRICULUM,  JOINTLY  DEVELOPED  BY EQUIMUNDO AND SEED FOUNDATION, AND WITH SUPPORT FROM THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE. THIS CURRICULUM HAS BEEN ADAPTED FOR THE  CONTEXT OF THE KURDISTAN REGION OF IRAQ (KRI) IN 2022.

This  innovative  program  centers  a  family  approach  to  gender  norms,  healthy relationships  between  families,  and  positive  parenting  techniques.  This  program engages  with  both  fathers  and  their  adolescent  sons  to  reduce  intergenerational violence and foster healthy, caring, and supportive relationships within the family.

Although  complementary  methodologies,  there  are  separate  fathers  and  son's curricula for each target group. This curriculum is intended to be facilitated to fathers with adolescent sons aged 15-19. The program for which this was designed engages Kurdish host community members, Iraqi internally displaced persons (IDPs), and the Syrian refugee population in KRI.

This  curriculum  has  been  largely  adapted  from  Equimundo's  Program  H,  designed for  young  boys.  Program  H  was  developed  to  engage  youth  in  critical  reflections on gender and help them build the skills necessary to act in more empowered and equitable ways. These programs have been adapted around the world to sensitize young men to some of the harmful ways they are socialized and to take on more gender-equitable attitudes.

## GUIDE TO USING THE CURRICULUM

Each session contains a series of activities that have been sourced from selected training manuals from countries in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia and adapted where necessary. The time needed for each of the activities and their complexity vary to cater to the curriculum's potential use in diverse settings and with different stakeholders. The activities included in this curriculum are specifically adapted to the context of adult men, particularly fathers, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

## EACH SESSION IS DESIGNED USING A STANDARDIZED FORMAT:

## Preparation for the Session

- Objectives: The purpose of each session is indicated.  Facilitators  can  inform  participants  of the  purpose  before  starting  a  new  session.
- Key Activities and Timing: Each activity has a title, which facilitators  may  choose  to  share  with  the group. The activity's recommended length is also indicated but will vary depending on the number of participants and adaptations that facilitators will need to make in relation to the characteristics of

the participants and the time available for training sessions/processes.

- Materials: The materials required to facilitate the activities  are  listed.  Materials  are  optional  for some  activities.
- Preparation: These are the steps that facilitators should  take,  well  in  advance,  to  prepare  for  the activities. These steps should be completed prior to  each  session  to  save  time  and  to  ensure  the activities  flow  smoothly.

## THEN, FOR EACH SESSION, THERE IS ADDITIONALLY:

## Welcome and Check-In

Checking in is a good way to start each new training session. It can be as simple as going around the circle and letting each participant briefly say who they are and how they are doing/feeling. Other areas you can cover when checking in are:

- If  something  new  has  happened  for  them  since the  previous  session
- If  they  have  taken  any  action  since  the  previous session  in  line  with  the  weekly  commitment
- One word that describes their state of being
- Their reflection on the discussions so far

## Each Session Activity

- Key Message(s): The  key message(s)  of the activity are indicated. These key messages should be emphasized during and upon concluding the activity.
- Procedure: These are the steps for carrying  out the activity.  They may need some adaptation in different contexts. Facilitators should be attentive to  whether  the  steps  are  appropriate  for  the participants  they  are  working  with.
- Group Discussion Questions : Most of the activities  include  group  discussion  questions  to help  guide  the  discussion  on  the  activity  topic. These questions serve as guidance for facilitators. It  is  not  usually  necessary  to  discuss  all  the questions or adhere to the order in which they are listed, and facilitators can use their best judgment on  using  them  depending  on  the  depth  and direction of the conversation among participants.
- Facilitator  Notes:  These  are  tips  for  trainers  in relation  to  specific  aspects  of  the  methodology and/or thematic content of the activity that may demand  their  special  attention.

Although the program is designed for adult men, there are places where it may be possible, if appropriate, to invite participation from the men's spouses and/ or children. Those places are noted in the curriculum.

## Mindfulness Activity

Many,  but  not  all,  sessions  include  a  mindfulness activity. These activities are to help participants relax and  destress  and  to  give  them  a  few  moments  of peace to help process the session's activities and the emotions that  may  have  been  stirred  up.  Facilitate these  peacefully  and  quietly  to  create  a  calming atmosphere.

## Weekly Commitment

At  the  close  of  most  sessions,  participants  will  be asked  to  take  one  or  more  specific  actions  in  line with that week's activities. These actions are specific tasks  that  will  help  them  incorporate  the  week's lessons into their daily lives and encourage them to share with their partners, children, and community. This is sort of the 'homework' of the curriculum. In the 'Welcome and Check-In' section of each week, participants  will  be  prompted  to  speak  about  how they  completed  their  weekly  commitment,  if  they were able.

## Closing and Check-Out

In  the  check-out  exercise,  you  can  also  do  a  light debrief of the session to enable participants to share what they most liked (or not) about the activity and what  they  learned.  This  is  also  an  opportunity  to address any emotions that might still need processing before the end of the session.

## Energizers and Icebreakers

Some  sessions  will  also  include  a  prompt  for  an 'energizer'  or  'icebreaker'  activity.  These  are  very short activities unrelated to session content in which participants  will  get  up  and  move  around.  These activities  help  relieve  stress  and  tension,  break  up sessions with a lot of sitting or discussion, and add an element of physical movement to the session. A number of these activities are included in Appendix A at the back of this curriculum, but facilitators are encouraged to come up with their own if they would like  and  to  modify  existing  ones  to  suit  their  own comfort and that of participants. Think about what you and others might enjoy or what you have done in  groups  with  other  facilitators  and  try  those  out. You might use a different one each time or find one that the group loves and come back to it regularly. Facilitators  are  encouraged  to  use  these  to  help participants feel more comfortable in the space and whenever they feel the energy in the room is getting low.

## F R A N C E GUIDANCE FOR FACILITATORS

reporting. It is important to be aware of the practical realities of the group members' lives and understand that they may face challenges or dangers when trying to make changes.

Changing attitudes and behaviors is a long process. Participation  in  these  activities  will  not  necessarily lead to an immediate transformation of individuals' lives  and  relationships.  However,  it  is  a  big  step toward  promoting  personal  change.

Before you begin, review your own views, assumptions,  and  prejudices,  and  avoid  bringing them to the group. Be aware if men from particular social, cultural, or religious backgrounds  trigger certain emotions in you, be they positive or negative, that  may  affect  your  own  work  in  the  group.  At the  same  time,  there  will  be  moments  when  it  is appropriate  and  helpful  for  you  to  share  your  own personal  opinions,  thoughts,  and  values  about  a topic. If the session is discussing a gender-equitable perspective  and  the  group  doesn't  seem  quite  on board, sharing your personal views can help open the door  for  change.

## ASKING QUESTIONS

One of the most important things you will do as a facilitator is simply ask questions. Doing so promotes dialogue  and  opens  new  pathways  for  participants to  explore  the  topics.  To  do  so,  see  your  group as  a  process.  Ask  'process  questions,'  questions that  cause  participants  to  reflect  more,  cannot  be answered with a 'yes' or 'no,' and are unbiased. See the  following  chart  for  additional  tips:

First  and  foremost,  you  should  see  yourself  as  a facilitator,  not  a  teacher.  Rather  than  lecturing,  ask questions  to  better  understand  where  participants are coming from and guide them in group reflections to critically look at harmful norms around masculinity. You do not have to be an expert in the topics you are discussing and do not need to have all the answers. Rather, the role of the facilitator is to create an open and respectful environment in which participants can feel comfortable sharing and learning from each other in a safe space.

The  facilitator's  role  is  to  promote  reflection  and participatory learning, present information neutrally, and create a horizontal learning experience in which the participants can learn from each other and from active participation in the activities. Other information to keep in mind includes being aware of your position of power, and accordingly, avoiding judgmental and authoritarian  attitudes.  Never  impose  your  feelings or  opinions  on  the  group  and  do  not  aim  to  instill fear  because  participants  may  'switch  off'  their emotions,  interest,  or  engagement  with  the  topic or feel paralyzed while participating.  Always  be conscious  of  the  language  you  use  and  messages you present.

Many of the themes in this curriculum are complex and sensitive. During sessions, pay attention to the participants' comfort level. In some cases, you may need to refer individuals to professional services such as counseling. Before you facilitate any session, it is essential that you have a list of available resources for participants should they need additional assistance and that all facilitators  are  well  versed  in  local  laws on  minors'  rights,  confidentiality,  and  mandatory

| YES, DO THIS!                                                                                                                                                                            | DON'T DO THIS!                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ask process questions. Examples: 'What do you think about discussing this with your spouse?' 'How do you think the conversation would go?' 'What made you think or feel that way?'       | Don't ask questions that can be answered with a 'yes' or 'no.' Example: 'Will you discuss this with your spouse?'                                                            |
| Be simple. Ask, 'When?' 'Where?' 'What?' 'How?' 'Who?' 'Why?' You should continue with a full sentence. Examples: 'What were you thinking when that happened? Why do you think that is?' | Don't ask a leading or biased question. Example: 'In order to be a good father, will you never yell at your children?'                                                       |
| Be unbiased. Exclude your own feelings and values from the questions, and instead guide participants in identifying problems and solutions.                                              | Don't ask too many questions at once. For participants to fully comprehend and answer your prompt, limit yourself to one or two at a time, with probes and follow-ups ready. |

There  are  many group  discussion  questions listed for  each  activity  to  help  participants  explore  and understand the issues at hand. Use these questions as a guide for conversation, not a checklist. What is likely to happen is that some of the issues raised by the questions will come up organically in the discussion, in which case there is no need to ask it again. Other questions may be answered by someone while they are  answering  a  different  question.  Sometimes,  a group member will ask others a question from the list without even knowing it. All of that is fine.

Overall, you want the discussion to feel comfortable and  natural for the participants. You  may  also combine  or  reword  the  questions  to  make  more sense or to refer to something that was said earlier, which helps the question feel more relevant to the group. Sometimes, if it seems like a question is too sensitive for the group at that time, you may choose to skip it or save it for a future session.

The more you get to know your group and develop your experience as a facilitator, the more comfortable you  will  feel  with  the  discussion  questions.  Just remember, the group is not students preparing for a test, and you are not a lecturer. You are a facilitator, and as such, are leading a discussion among friends.

## TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL FACILITATION

The  following  are  several  useful  tips  to  help  you lead the group sessions. These tips will help you to encourage  and  create  a  respectful  environment  in which  men  feel  comfortable  sharing  their  opinions and experiences, as well as listen to and learn from others.

- Remember the group agreement. Ask participants to  decide  on  a  set  of  agreements  and  remind them of those agreements throughout the sessions.  Important  group  agreements  relate  to listening to and showing respect for others (e.g., not talking when others are speaking, not making rude  comments,  or  not  talking  on  the  phone), confidentiality,  and  participation.
- Do  not judge. Remember,  you  are here to facilitate  discussion  and  reflection.  Your  role  is not  to  teach  or  punish  anyone.  Be  friendly  and create  rapport  with  your  participants.  Be  aware of your own position of power - avoid judgmental and  authoritarian  attitudes.  Never  impose  your feelings  or  opinions  on  the  group.
- Promote  inclusion. Ensure  that  all  participants have  the  opportunity  to  speak.  Be  careful  not to  let  one  person  dominate  the  conversation or  make  other  people  feel  that  they  cannot share their opinions. Encourage people to share their  experiences  and  learn  to  identify  when people want to speak but may be too shy to say

something unless called on. If a participant begins to take over a group by spending too much time with  a  story,  find  an  opening  and  kindly  say,  'It sounds like you have a lot of valuable experiences to share with the group. That's great! Do others have similar  or  different  stories  they  would  also like  to  share?'

- Address participants' concerns. The group meetings can serve as an important opportunity for  participants  to  receive  help  and  advice.  As  a facilitator, it is important that you validate people's concerns,  but  you  can  also  engage  the  larger group  in  helping  to  propose  solutions.  Ask  the group, 'How do you think this problem could be solved?' or, 'Has anyone faced a similar situation? What did you do?'
- Know and use referral services. Some problems that participants face may require outside support. In addition, some participants may prefer to  discuss a particular topic, obtain information, or  seek  support  outside  of  a  group  setting,  or they may  need  attention  from  a specialized service  provider.  As  a  facilitator,  you  should  be knowledgeable  on  places  where  you  can  refer participants  if  needed.
- Manage conflicts respectfully. If a conflict arises among  the  group,  or  if  a  participant  shares  a discriminatory  view,  remind  the  participants  of the group agreement. Encourage other members to  help  mediate  the  situation.  Ask  the  group what  they  think  about  the  question  raised  or how they  would  suggest  handling  the  problem. When necessary, you can offer brief responses to questions  and  clarify  misinformation.
- Appreciate  honesty  and  openness. Encourage participants to be honest and open. They should not be afraid to discuss sensitive issues for fear of  ridicule  from  their  peers.  Thank  the  group members  for sharing their personal stories. Never force anyone to participate in the activities. Instead, try to create an environment in which the participants  feel  comfortable.
- Promote  movement  and  interaction. Include as  much  physical  movement  as  possible  so that participants remain active, alert, and interested.  You  are  encouraged  to  use  short energizer activities in between activities to keep the  participants  engaged  in  the  topics  you  are discussing.
- Manage  your  time. Keep  track  of  time;  do  not spend  too  long  on  a  given  activity  or  session. Keep  in  mind  participants'  attention  spans  and schedules.
- Ask  for  feedback. Use  a  'check-out'  to  receive regular feedback from participants.  What  do they like and dislike about the activities? What is

working or not working? Use their input to improve the  sessions.  Do  not  divert  from  the  planned activities but use feedback to improve the running of  the  sessions  (for  example,  by  including  more energizers).

- Be respectful in your presence and appearance. Try to be as respectful as possible in your appearance and your nonverbal and verbal presentation.  This  includes  the  way  you  dress (avoiding clothes that distract) and address participants (work on remembering their names a  simple  name  game  can  help  with  that).
- Be careful of topics that may cause retraumatization. Given  some  of  these  issues' sensitivity, it  is  possible  that  participants  will bring  up  personal  experiences  of  sexual  trauma or  abuse.  Under  SEED's  reporting  requirements for  facilitators  and  staff  and  as  part  of  child safeguarding, all forms of potential or suspected harm  to  a  child  must  be  reported  (including actions or failings that place children at risk of, or result  in,  child  abuse,  including  physical  abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, exploitation, injury,  neglect,  and  any  other  harm,  whether perpetrated  externally  or  internally).  Thus,  it  is important that at the beginning of each session, you  remind  participants  that  they  are  welcome to  leave  the  room  if  they  feel  uncomfortable. They  are  not  required  to  share  any  sensitive information, and for those under 18, you as the facilitator  are  required  to  report  instances  of abuse. This should be repeated at the beginning of  particularly  sensitive  activities  as  well.  Also remind participants of the resources available to them and that you are available after the session to talk further. Refer participants to service providers with whom they can discuss any issues they may be having. It is also helpful to go over the ground rules (group agreements) about respecting  confidentiality  in  the  group  setting, and the participants should also be reminded not to  share  any  personal  information  that  they  do not  want  to  be  revealed  outside  of  the  group.
- Keep  discussions  from  straying  too  far  from the  key  messages. One  of  the  main  facilitator tools you can use is the 'bank,' also known as the 'parking lot.' While all discussions are welcome, if  a  participant  brings  up  a  topic  that  cannot  be addressed within the time allotted, write it on a flipchart paper called the 'bank' or 'parking lot.' It  is  important  that  these  topics  are  revisited  at another time. However, if the topic is completely unrelated  say  something  like,  'That's  a  great comment.  We  don't  have  time  to  address  that right  now,  but  let's  talk  more  about  it  after  the session.'
- Be friendly and create rapport with your participants. As  a  facilitator,  you  are  not  an authority figure. You are not sitting in judgment or giving participants grades or evaluations. It is fine and even encouraged to joke with participants, call each other by first names, share personal details (as appropriate), and even socialize outside of the group setting. All of that builds the relationships that make the group effective. You are encouraged to share in the group examples from your life and your own struggles, challenges, and realizations. Doing so provides an example for the group and helps them see that change is possible and what the process of change looks like. You do not have to be perfect, just on the same path to personal growth  that  you  are  asking  the  participants  to walk.

## RUNNING EACH SESSION

- Review the session and guidance. Prior to each  session,  review  the  'Materials  Needed,' 'Preparation,'  and  'Facilitator  Notes'  sections, as  well  as  the  activity  procedure.  This  will  help ensure  that  you  are  prepared  to  facilitate  each activity and will allow you time to gather additional materials and become more informed on the topic if  necessary.
- Prepare  the  space. When  preparing  the  space, always  arrange  chairs  in  a  circle  for  all  sessions unless otherwise noted. It is recommended that during the sessions, you offer participants some type of refreshment and engage them in physical activity and motion. Beverages and food tend to be  highly  valued  by  participants  and  help  them stay in the group process.
- Check  in  at  the  beginning  of  each  session. It is  important  to  begin  each  session  by  warmly welcoming  back  the  group  and  checking  in.  A check-in  provides  time  for  group  participants  to share  any  thoughts,  personal  experiences,  and comments they have had based on the discussion from  the  last  session.  Spend  several  minutes checking in prior to beginning the day's session. To  have  time  for  the  session  activities,  keep check-ins  brief,  without  responses  or  discussion - check-ins shouldn't be more than ten minutes.
- Review  the  group  agreements . Most  of  the sessions  will  ask  group  participants  to  share personal experiences. To create safe spaces for participants, at the beginning of every session, review the ground rules that were established by the group in Session 1 ('Welcome and  Introductions').  This  promotes  trust  and confidentiality within the group.

- Carry out the session - but be flexible, be creative, and contextualize activities. Each session contains  procedures  to  take  the  group  through activities  and group  discussion  questions to prompt critical reflection. The structure proposed in this manual for implementing activities should serve  as  a  general  guide;  it  is  not  necessary  to apply  it  verbatim.  Facilitators  can  change  the order  of  certain  activities'  elements  or  alter  the listed  examples  to  make  them  more  relevant to  their  group's  reality  and  to  reflect  their  own knowledge and skills. If the topics and examples presented in these activities come across as too abstract or removed from your reality, you can add in examples from your daily life and experiences. This will help participants to  be  emotionally involved and identify more  closely with the material. Sharing personal experiences also helps to model the behavior you want from the men in your group. Be careful, though, not to stray too far from the curriculum, as this can prevent you from reaching  the  sessions'  objectives.
- Use icebreakers and energizers. Icebreakers are short activities that help participants build trust in the group, usually in a lighthearted way. They are a great way to open a session, allowing participants to move around, share, and become comfortable with  one  another.  Energizers  are  short  activities that  are  most  helpful  when  the  group  appears to have low energy, be losing interest, or not be responding to the activity. These help to change the  routine,  get  people  in  motion,  and  relieve fatigue  and  boredom.  They  take  only  a  few minutes.
- Keep group discussions open-ended and among participants. Group discussions can be the most important part of each activity. These discussions are  opportunities  for  men  to  reflect  on  what they've been doing, talk with one another about their  thoughts, and think critically about how to see changes in their own lives. It is important for facilitators to make sure that conversations remain open,  judgment-free,  and  comfortable.  Try  and get the group to talk to one another rather than having one-on-one conversations with whoever is leading the facilitation.
- 'Check out' at the end of the day. End each day with  a  one-word  'check-out'  that  emphasizes some of the key messages or lessons that they learned  during  that  session.  Use  this  time  to reflect  on  the  main  conclusions  of  the  day,  to announce the next activities, or to see what can be improved and what worked well, for example.

## TIPS FOR CREATING A SAFE SPACE FOR PARTICIPANTS AND RESPONDING TO SENSITIVE DISCUSSIONS

Most  of  the  sessions  in  this  curriculum  include reflective conversations about  possibly sensitive topics. As facilitators, it's important to foster a  safe  space  for  the  participants  to  share  their thoughts and emotions. Make sure you are actively and empathetically listening without judging or interrupting the participants' stories. Do not pressure anyone  to  share  but  be  sure  to  allow  participants to  talk  about  what  the  exercise  evokes  in  them, promote reflection, and highlight the key messages of the exercise. If any participant shares any painful experiences,  is  deeply  moved,  or  cries,  you  can implement any of the following recommendations as you  see  fit: 1

- Don't judge. This isn't always easy, but set aside your own opinions to focus on the other person's perspective.  Recognizing  the  participant's  views and  emotions  will  help  them  feel  heard  and understood. This doesn't mean you have to agree with everything the person says - it's about letting them know you care.
- Give the person your full attention. Pay attention with your gaze, your body language, and a warm tone of voice. Maintain eye contact, nodding and giving other cues as appropriate to show you are paying attention, without interrupting. Giving your full attention shows respect, and a person is more likely to remain calm when they feel respected.
- Listen  carefully  (feelings  and  facts). Actively listen  to  the  words  and  experiences participants describe  -  as  well  as  the  emotions  reflected  in their  tone  of  voice,  body  language,  and  other cues - to go beyond words and identify emotions. Listen  with  your  heart,  gaze,  voice,  and  ears.
- Don't be afraid of silence. Sometimes, all a person needs is to be heard or to know you are there. The person may be thinking about what they are going to say next or may need a few moments of silence to  restrain  their  emotions.  Let  the  person  finish speaking before offering a few words of support.
- Say  thank  you. Express appreciation for the participants' openness and confidence in sharing their experiences or for being vulnerable. Comment  that  many  of  us  have  had  painful experiences with our own parents and being able to  recognize  them  can  help  us  heal.

- Consider sitting next to the distressed person. You can hold their hand or rest your hand on their back if appropriate in the context, or you can ask the person if they want to go out and get some air  and  accompany  them  if  there  is  a  second facilitator.
- Repeat and paraphrase. Ask questions to confirm and validate experiences that have been shared. Refer  to  the  person's  words:  For  example,  'I heard that Ahmed felt humiliated when his father insulted him. Is that right?' Keep a respectful and nonjudgmental attitude and give the person time to respond. Remember that there is no script for empathic listening. Respond based on the person, the situation, and the moment.
- Resist  the  temptation  to  give  advice. Limit yourself  to  listening,  validating  the  experience, being  grateful  for  it  having  been  shared,  and looking for  common  ground  with  the  other participants.
- Follow up. Between sessions or at the beginning or end of the next session, approach the participant who  had  been  emotionally  affected,  ask  how they have been, and suggest other times to meet if necessary  or consider offering information about psychological support services if they are still  distressed.  (See  the  following  guidance  on responding  to  disclosures.)

## RESPONDING TO DISCLOSURES RELATED TO VIOLENCE OR MENTAL HEALTH

Some  problems  that  participants  may  be  facing, such  as  mental  health  issues,  substance  abuse, or  intimate  partner  violence,  may  require  outside support. In addition, some participants may prefer to discuss a particular concern, obtain information, or seek support outside of a group setting, or they may need  attention  from  a  specialized  service  provider. As  a  facilitator,  you  should  be  comfortable  making referrals to SEED's service providers and ensure you do not put the person at risk, and you should consult with  your  supervisor  if  you  are  unsure  of  how  to handle  a  particular  problem.

Use the following guidelines to respond to disclosures of violence or other sensitive issues that might require external,  specialist  services.  Please  always  consult with  your  supervisor  if  you  are  unsure  what  to  do. During a session, if a participant discloses a painful life  experience, you can sit with the participant and ask them if they wish to share their experience. Be sure to avoid pressuring the participant to disclose. Ensure  that  the  group  listens  with  attention  and extreme  respect.

It  is  important  to  establish  if  the  participant  is currently at risk of violence or if this is a story of past violence. If the instance of violence was recent or it seems like they are still at risk, consult with the relevant service delivery coordinator to make a referral. If the instance of violence was in the past, practicing  empathy  and  active  listening  is  very important  to  ensure  the  participant  feels  heard and validated. If the person still seems emotionally distressed  or  has  mental  health  symptoms  as  a result of past violence, consider referring them to mental  health  services.

If a participant reveals that they have experienced or are  experiencing  violence,  it  is  important  to  follow these  steps:

- Listen  with  empathy,  validate  their  experiences and  concerns,  and  be  sensitive.
- Become  familiar  with  the  resources  available locally and have a printed copy available with the names  and  contact  information  of  centers  that offer specialized services for survivors of intimate partner violence. Consult with the service delivery coordinator, Protection and Service Delivery Manager, or Protection Technical Advisor if you  need  additional  support  with  referring  the participant  without  placing  them  at  risk.
- If the person is interested in receiving specialized services (whether internally at SEED or externally), give them the relevant information. Inform your  colleague  about  the  participant  or  inform your  external  contact  at  the  local  center  that  a participant will be looking for help or information.
- Show  the  participant  that  you  care  and  your concern for their feelings.
- Do  all  you  can  to  help  the  person  feel  calm, supported, and connected to others.
- Evaluate  if  there  is  a  current  or  ongoing  risk  of extreme  intimate  partner  violence.
- Discuss the case with your supervisor.
- At  the  end  of  the  session,  sit  with  the  person and ask them how they are doing. You can also suggest the group support the person. In the next session, ask how they fared after the session and during  the  week.
- If  the  disclosure  of  intimate  partner  violence occurred within the larger group, carefully remind the  group  of  the  agreements  of  respect  and confidentiality.

## Actions to avoid when working with a participant who discloses violence:

- Attempting to solve their problems
- Convincing them to leave the violent relationship
- Convincing them to go to the police or to court
- Asking detailed questions that force them to relive painful  experiences
- Asking them to analyze what happened and why
- Pressuring them to reveal their feelings
- Blaming them for the violence
- Disrespecting their agency and choice

These actions can do more harm than good. 2

## If a man discloses using violence against his partner:

- Do not allow the group to make light of the issue or make jokes.
- Remember that in cases of disclosure of violence, it  is  essential  to  respect  confidentiality.  Ensure that  all  group  members  are  aware  that  what  is shared in the group should not leave the group, as  it  is  critical  to  guarantee  the  security  of  the victims.  All  disclosures  of  violence  should  be discussed with supervisors but never with members of the community. Any follow-up action should  be  decided  between  the  facilitators  and their supervisor. If the disclosure occurred within the group, ensure that everyone follows the rules of  confidentiality  and  respect.
- Remember  that  exceptions  to  the  principle  of confidentiality  apply  only  if  a  participant  reveals that they will harm another person or themselves or when someone's bodily integrity or life faces an immediate  risk.

## If a participant reveals their intent to harm another person:

1. Speak with your supervisor to determine whom to  contact  to  help  the  person  in  danger  and connect them to any available resources in the community  that  can  provide  support.
2. Make  a  connection:  Give  the  person  in  danger information about organizations (including SEED's  services  for  survivors)  where  they  can receive help. If the individual decides to go, call a contact in the organization (or speak with your colleague  in  advance)  to  let  them  know  that someone will be seeking support and ask them to  receive  the  person  warmly.
3. Inform  your  supervisor  immediately  after  the session so they can take any necessary action.

Men's groups should not be considered an appropriate  place  to  share  details  about  acts  of violence  against  women.  This  could  reinforce patriarchal  ideas  that  legitimize  violence.  In  such cases, the focus should be on how to manage anger and violence, on the harm that can be caused, on men taking responsibility for their actions, and on ensuring that potential survivors are not in danger.

## If a participant reports severe mental health issues:

If  a  participant  requires  specialist  support,  having disclosed suicidal thoughts or demonstrated severe  depression  during  a  session,  acknowledge this  disclosure  in  the  moment  and  create  a  plan to  talk  individually  with  the  participant.  When  the session  ends,  determine  if  they  consent  to  being referred to SEED's mental health services and discuss  the  case  with  your  supervisor.  Remember that facilitators are not the participants' counselors or therapists.

## SESSION 1 WELCOME AND INTRODUCTIONS

<!-- image -->

SEED FOUNDATION

13

## OBJECTIVES

- To welcome participants to the group and allow everyone to get to know each other
- To establish a safe group environment in which everyone feels listened to and respected
- For participants to share their expectations of what they will get out of the program

## KEY ACTIVITIES AND TIMING

1. Welcome and Pre-Test - 20 minutes
2. Introductions - 20 minutes
3. Energizer - 5 minutes
4. Group Agreement - 15 minutes
5. Sharing Expectations - 20 minutes
6. Program Topics - 10 minutes
7.  Closing and Check-Out -5 minutes

Total session time: 95 minutes

## MATERIALS

-  Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)
- Copies of pre-test survey for all participants
- Pens/pencils for all participants

## PREPARATION

- Before the first group session, it is important that you as a facilitator understand the difference between a traditional teaching style (in which the teacher or facilitator is above the participants) and the group education facilitation style (in which the facilitator and group members are equals).
- Make sure that you have your materials together.
- Arrange the space so that it is inviting and equitable. There should be no desks or tables if possible, and chairs should be arranged in a circle. The facilitator's chair should be part of the circle. There can be a break in the circle to place the flipchart easel or to put flipchart papers on the wall.
- Literacy Note: This activity requires some literacy/writing ability, so be aware and mindful of participants' levels of literacy. If you feel one or more group members will struggle, explore alternative ways for them to complete the activity.

## PART 1: WELCOME AND PRE-TEST (20 MINUTES)

1. Welcome participants to the group as they arrive and introduce yourself. If there are snacks or drinks available, encourage them to go ahead and take something.
2. Thank them for coming and record each person's name and information on the intake sheet/ attendance  log.
3. Once everyone has arrived (or enough time has passed), ask participants to sit down and tell the group:
- 'Over the next few months, we will meet once per week for a total of 10 meetings. Each session will have a different topic and will include interactive activities and group discussion. The goal of these sessions is to help each of us be the man we want to be and that our families need us to be.'

- 'We all  face  challenges  and  difficulties  in  our  lives,  and  by  discussing  them  with  each  other and working together, we may be able to find solutions we would not otherwise have found. Sometimes when we are loaded down with troubles, it is easy to forget the good things in our life - spouses and children who love us and whom we love and who bring us joy.'
- 'I hope that for each of us, participating in this group will help us find, or rediscover, more areas of joy in our life with our family, as well as new friends here in the group.'
4. Tell participants that before you start the program, they will take a survey in which they will be asked about some of their attitudes, beliefs, and practices.
5. Hand out the pre-test survey and have the participants complete them.

## PART 2: INTRODUCTIONS (20 MINUTES)

1. After  you  have  welcomed  everyone  to  the  session,  explain  that  you  would  now  like  everyone to  introduce  themselves to the group. Go around the circle and ask each person to introduce themselves  by  sharing  the  following  information:
-  Their name
- Their child(ren)'s age(s) and gender
- One thing they enjoy about being a parent
- One thing they find challenging about being a parent

Facilitator Note: Use your own notebook or a piece of paper (not the flipchart) to write down the names of participants and the information about them as they introduce themselves. This will  help  you  remember who they are and details about them more quickly. Also write down their answers to the questions about what they enjoy and what they find challenging, as this can  help  you  support  them  and  customize  aspects  of  the  curriculum  to  participants  as  you go along.

2. After each participant has introduced themselves, ask the group if they have any questions about the group sessions.

## PART 3: ENERGIZER (5 MINUTES)

1. Select an energizer or icebreaker from the back of the curriculum, or use one you like, to help participants  get  to  know  each  other  and  get  comfortable  in  the  space.

## PART 4: GROUP AGREEMENT (15 MINUTES)

1. Explain that in this activity, the group will make a group agreement that will promote a safe space in which they can find honesty, trust, and support.
2. Ask the group: 'What agreements would help you to feel safe and comfortable discussing and sharing in this group?'

Facilitator Note: You should write down the list of agreements on a flipchart paper. Remember that  these  need  to  be  visible  in  every  session.  The  following  box  lists  several  recommended agreements. If these are not mentioned first by the group members, recommend that they be included.

## IMPORTANT GROUP AGREEMENTS FOR A SUCCESSFUL GROUP

## Privacy and Confidentiality

- The privacy of personal experiences must be secured. No one should discuss the private information shared in the group with others in the community if the person recounting the experience does not want it to be shared. All personal stories and experiences that are shared in the group will remain in the group.
- However, participants are encouraged to share any knowledge or lessons they have learned in the sessions with others outside of this group, such as friends, family members, and neighbors.

## Equality

- All members of the group are equal, irrespective of age, background, or any other characteristics. All members have a voice and the right to speak, share, and contribute.
- All members are responsible for their own actions and behavior. Every member takes responsibility for what they do.

## Respect and Empathy

- Speak one at a time. Allow each person the time to speak. Everyone's viewpoint is important, and we need to make sure that everyone is heard. Listen and show interest in what others have to say.
- Practice empathy. Imagine yourself in the other person's position and try to understand how they feel. Respect the opinions of others and try not to judge others for their experiences or opinions.
- Every member should actively participate and contribute to the group. Use only 'I believe,' 'I think,' or 'I have experienced' statements. Do not assume that your viewpoint is shared with everyone else in the group.
- Commit to attending all the sessions and to being on time.
3. After a list of agreements is created, ask: 'Is there anything missing that you would like to add?' Make any additions to the flipchart list that are suggested.
4. After the list is complete, ask each group member: 'Does everyone agree to this list and commit to upholding these agreements during our sessions?'

Facilitator Note: If someone does not want to commit, ask them why. Ask the group: 'Are there alternative agreements that you would feel more comfortable with?' Suggest that the agreement be changed or removed, depending on the desires of the group.

5. Read the Key Message: 'Creating group agreements will help everyone to feel comfortable, safe, and respected within this group. The agreements will remain in place for the duration of the group sessions. It is everyone's responsibility to follow them and encourage others to follow them.'

## PART 5: SHARING EXPECTATIONS (20 MINUTES)

1. Put up two flipchart papers on opposite sides of the room (if possible). Write at the top of one 'Hopes and Expectations' and at the top of the other 'Concerns and Fears.'
2. Ask participants to think for a few minutes about their hopes or expectations, and concerns or fears, regarding the group. Put out markers and ask them to go to one flipchart paper and then the other (in any order) to share expectations for the group sessions.
3. After  a  few  minutes,  read  the  'Hopes  and  Expectations'  paper  and  ask  if  anyone  has  any comments or anything they wrote they would like to elaborate on. Then, do the same with the 'Concerns  and  Fears'  paper.
4. Mention some of the hopes and expectations that you believe will be met by the group and note any that you don't think the group will be able to meet for whatever reason. Then, address concerns and fears, alleviating as many as you can. If there are any that require one-on-one follow-up after the group session, ask whoever wrote it to speak with you or another facilitator privately after the session.
5. Thank the group for sharing.
6. Read the Key Message: 'Sharing our hopes and expectations is an important first step toward making positive changes in our lives and relationships. Through our discussion, we can develop realistic  expectations  of  what  will  be  accomplished  during  our  time  together.  Knowing  each other's desires for this group will also enable us to better help each other with the problems we are facing.'

Facilitator Note: There will likely be some expectations or topics that will not be covered during the group sessions. To set realistic expectations, explain to the group that although some of their expectations or desires may not be directly discussed during the group meetings, they should use the group and its members as an opportunity to seek advice, to discuss important matters, or to learn from each other.

## PART 6: PROGRAM TOPICS (10 MINUTES)

1. Tell participants: 'This program will cover some, but probably not all, of the topics you raised and your expectations. Some of the key things we will cover include…'
- 'We will discuss what it means to be men in our society today, and how that affects us as individuals,  as  spouses,  and  as  parents.'
- 'Some of those challenges we will discuss and try to address are expressing our emotions, dealing with anger and conflict, and the effects of violence on our lives.'
- 'We will talk about and develop skills, especially around communication and conflict resolution, that will help us understand ourselves, our spouses, and our children better, and in turn, will help us improve as individuals, spouses, and parents.'
- 'Finally, we will talk about crafting a vision and plan for our family's future. We will talk about what we want and need, what challenges we may face, and how to achieve our vision for a happy and healthy life.'

'A program like this one has been implemented in many other countries around the world. Many men have benefited greatly from this curriculum, including some of the benefits I just spoke about so far. We are excited for you to join the many men who have already benefited from the group sessions.'

## PART 7: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

3. Explain that you will use all questions posed and expectations shared to further inform and shape the coming sessions.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Explain that the session is ending and that each meeting will end with a 'check-out,' during which participants will have an opportunity to reflect on what has been discussed.
6. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any final questions?
- Are you looking forward to our future meetings?
7. After addressing the questions, confirm the time, date, and place of the next session.

<!-- image -->

## PART 2: MY FATHER'S LEGACY (40 MINUTES)

1. Ask everyone to close their eyes and think about an object that they associate with their father. This object may be a tool, a book, a set of car keys, a strap used for punishment, etc. If they did not have or did not know their father, ask them to think about any important male figure in their life, such as a grandfather, uncle, older brother, or teacher.
2. Tell the group to spend a few minutes focusing on the relationship between the object that they identified and a moment or memory that they shared with this man. What emotions does this object recall for them?
3. After two minutes, tell everyone to open their eyes. Ask for volunteers to share a story about their object and how it relates to their father from their early lives. If they did not have either a father or male caregiver in their life, ask them to think about what impact this might have had on them.
4. As each person shares his story, thank him for having the emotional strength to share with the group.
5. Once everyone has finished sharing, thank them once again for the trust participants have in the group.
6. Reveal the flipchart paper that you have prepared with the following statements:
- One thing that my father did that I have already repeated or want to repeat with my children is…
- Something about my father that I have not repeated or do not want to repeat with my children is…
7. Read the statements out loud. Then, ask participants to turn to the person sitting next to them and share their thoughts about these questions, working in pairs. Give the pairs ten minutes to discuss.
8. After ten minutes, bring the group back together and lead a discussion with the following Group Discussion Questions :
- Thinking back to a time when you were an adolescent (12-17 yrs), what were some of challenges during that time with you and your father? (Probe: most times at this age, teenagers are trying to be more independent and find it difficult to regulate their emotions. [i.e., hobbies/sports, video games, lack of focus in school, etc.])
- What would you have liked your father to know during this time when you were your sons age?
- What are some of the things that concern you as a father or cause you stress? (you can write these down on a flipchart to discuss)
- Are  any  of  the  worries  or  anxieties  that  you  have  about  fatherhood  influenced  by  societal expectations  or  what  it  means  to  'be  a  man'?
- Additional questions if you have time:
- In a lot of households, we hear things like, 'Men should not cry' and 'Men should raise sons to be tough.' How do you think this impacted our fathers? How do you think it impacted the way they cared for us?
- Did your father parent his sons and daughters differently? Do you? In what ways?
- How do you think these beliefs affected our mothers?
- How can you 'leave behind' harmful practices to become more involved fathers?
- What are some of the things you enjoy about being a father?
9. Read the Key Message: 'Who we are today was shaped by our experiences growing up, both positive and negative. They can, but do not have to, determine who we will become in the future. Reflecting on our past enables us to make positive choices for the future by replacing negative attitudes and behaviors with positive ones. Being a father can be a particularly stressful time for a man for many reasons. Sharing your worries and concerns with other men - and with your partner - can help to alleviate some of this stress and find solutions when needed.'

## PART 3: MEN'S AND WOMEN'S ROLES AND EXPECTATIONS (40 MINUTES)

1. Explain to the participants that this activity will help them think about the social roles assigned to men and women and how society influences our ideas and expectations of being fathers and mothers.
2. Ask the participants what it means to 'be a man.' Write down the words and phrases they say on a piece of paper or a flipchart paper. On the paper, make two columns: one that says 'Man' and one that says 'Woman.' Explain that the responses can be positive or negative, and the participants should think of both biological aspects and social characteristics.
3. After everyone has responded, ask the group what it means to 'be a woman' (or to be a mother). Write down the words and phrases mentioned by the group in the 'Woman' column. Remind the group to think of both biological and social characteristics of women.
4. After all the responses are written down, cross out the titles and switch them, so that the ones titled 'man' are now 'woman,' and vice versa.
5. Read the list of characteristics for a man (now marked 'woman') aloud to the group one by one. Ask the participants if the characteristics (social and biological) they mentioned for men could also be attributed to women. After each characteristic, ask the group if women ever display these characteristics.
6. Next, read the list of characteristics for a woman (now marked 'man') aloud to the group one by one. Ask the group whether the characteristics mentioned for women could also be attributed to men. After each characteristic, ask the group if men ever display these characteristics.

NOTE: Steps 7-9 are optional in contexts that can discuss the word 'gender', otherwise skip to discussion questions (Step 10)

7. Explain to the group that the biological characteristics of women that cannot be given to men, and vice versa, are what constitute our sex. Sex is biological - we are born with male or female reproductive organs and hormones.
8. Next, explain that the social characteristics of women/mothers - the roles and characteristics we usually equate with women/mothers but that can be done by both women and men - (and vice versa) constitute our gender. Gender is how we are socialized - that is, how our attitudes, behaviors, and expectations are formed based on what society associates with being a woman or being a man. We are not born with these characteristics but learn them as we grow up.
9. Tell the group that is it very easy to confuse gender with sex. Explain that gender is constructed by our society. Society assigns certain attitudes and behaviors to individuals based on their sex (for example, that women care for children and men work outside the home), and every individual is influenced by these social expectations. These social expectations based on sex do not remain the same but change over time.
10. Ask the following Group Discussion Questions :

Facilitator Note: As you open the discussion, help the group talk about which characteristics the participants do not think can be attributed to both men and women and why. However, make sure these sex and gender categories are not presented as rigid, inflexible, or unchanging.

- How do our families and friends influence our ideas of how women and men should look and should act? What other factors influence those ideas?
- Do you think that expectations for how men and women should look and act are different today than when your parents and grandparents were growing up? How? Why?
- Is it hard to live up to these expectations of being a man? Being a woman?

- What might be some benefits (to yourself, your family, and your community) of doing roles outside of what is traditionally expected of you? (i.e., protector and provider, emotionally stoic, etc.)

## Additional questions if time allows:

- What does 'honor' mean in the context of the social expectations for men and women?
- How do expectations of honor affect how men and women live their lives?
- How do these different expectations of how women and men should act influence our roles as parents and how we interact with our children? Are there moments where, as parents, men must do things on the 'women's' list and women things on the 'men's' list?
- Do these different social expectations mean that we parent our sons and daughters differently? In what ways?
- What did you learn from this activity? Is there anything that you learned that you could apply to your own lives or relationships?
11.  Explain the Key Message: ' Although there are biological differences between men and women, many of the differences we attribute to men and women are constructed by our society. These differences are not part of our biology - we are not born this way - but we learn that these are the ways we are expected to behave. We learn these characteristics from family members, friends, cultural and religious institutions, and school. And our roles and expectations as men or women can change as our culture changes.'

## PART 4: WEEKLY COMMITMENT (5 MINUTES)

1. Share the Weekly Commitment : 'During the next week, each participant is asked to do one thing that is different than the traditional gender expectations for men. This should be something they have not done before or do not usually do. Come to the next session ready to discuss how it felt to do this, and what feelings it brought up for you.'

## PART 5: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing their thoughts, questions, concerns, and experiences today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

- Also  identify  local  psychological  counseling  centers  or  specialists  that  participants  can  be referred  to,  if  possible.
- Print Journal Activity 4.1 for everyone
- Literacy Note: This activity requires some literacy/writing ability, so be aware and mindful of participants'  levels  of  literacy.  If  you  feel  one  or  more  group  members  will  struggle,  explore alternative  ways for them to complete the activity.

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:
-  How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
3. Ask participants about last week's commitment to do something outside of the traditional gender expectations of men: 'Who was able to do this? What did you do? How did it feel?'

After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

<!-- image -->

- Markers
- Flipchart  paper  and  easel  (or  tape  for walls)
- Cards with one of the following emotions  written  on  each:  stressed, angry, scared, caring, happy, sad
- Small pieces of writing paper
- Pens/pencils for all participants
- Raisins/candies for everyone
- Journal Activity 4.1

## PART 2: EXPRESSING EMOTIONS (45 MINUTES)

1. Introduce the activity to the participants by stating that you'll be talking about emotions today. And ask them to brainstorm different emotions that people can feel. Write them on a flip chart paper. Be sure you cover the six emotions that you have written cards for so everyone understands at least those six.
2. Split the participants into two groups and give each group 3 cards on which you wrote different emotions.
3. Explain to the participants that these are emotions that will be discussed in this activity and they will be thinking about how difficult or easy it is to express these emotions.
4. Tell  the groups that they will act out the emotions on their cards as a group. The other group should try to guess which emotion they are acting out. They will have a few minutes to prepare with their groups first.
5. Give each group a few minutes to prepare how they will act out the emotions on their cards, and then give each group a chance to act theirs out. The group should all shout out their guesses immediately . When someone finally guesses the emotion being expressed, write it on the flipchart so at the end you have a list of all the emotions from the activity.
6. Repeat the activity until each group has exhausted their cards they have been provided.
7. Display the flipchart with all of the emotions that have been written down. Ask the participants to add any other common emotions that have not been listed.
8. Ask participants the following Group Discussion Questions (each person should pick one or two emotions from the list to discuss):
- To what extent do you feel these emotions?
- How often are you able to express these emotions socially? How do you express them?
- Who do you see expressing these emotions in your family or community most often? Why do you think that is?
9. Discuss the similarities and differences among the participants' answers in terms of what emotions are easy or hard to express, which are socially acceptable for different groups, and who expresses different emotions.
10.  Explain that there are some emotions that we have learned to express well or sometimes even over-express.  Others  we  have  learned  to  contain  and  not  express  as  much,  even  hiding  them sometimes. Some may fall in between these areas.

## 11.  Ask the following additional Group Discussion Questions :

- Why do people express some emotions and contain other ones? How do they learn to do this? What are the consequences of over-expressing or containing emotions for long?
- How do men and women express their emotions differently? Are there any similarities?
- How  do  friends,  family,  society,  and  media  influence  the  way  men  and  women  express themselves?
- Is it easy to express emotions to friends and family? Your partner?
- Do we sometimes take for granted that our partner and children know that we care about them and forget to express love and caring with them? How can we do more of that, even as our children get older?
- In your opinion, how do you think you can better express your emotions in a way that promotes your well-being?

## 12.  Read the Key Message :

- 'Different emotions reflect different needs, and it's best to learn how to handle our emotions in our daily lives. The ability to express emotions without causing harm to others can make us stronger and helps us deal better with the world around us.'
- 'The ways we express our emotions differ from one person to another, yet some conflicts may arise, especially when it comes to raising boys. For example, it's common for men to hide their fear and sadness even with their children. It's common to express these emotions through anger and violence. And as boys grow older, we often express love and affection toward them less than when they were young, even though they still need it just as much.'
- 'Even though you are not responsible for what you feel, you are responsible for how you handle your emotions. It is important to differentiate between 'emotion' and 'behavior,' and to work hard at expressing emotions without causing harm to ourselves and to others.'

## PART 3: WHAT DO I DO WHEN I AM ANGRY? (30 MINUTES)

1. Explain to participants: 'Now that we have thought about our emotions generally, we are going to explore one of them, anger, more deeply. Many people, especially many men, confuse anger and violence, thinking they are the same. It is important to emphasize that anger is a natural emotion, and everyone feels it throughout their lives. Violence is a behavior in which anger is expressed. However, there are other ways to express anger - better and more positive ways than violence. If we learn how to express our anger when we feel it, it will be better than leaving it to accumulate, which often leads us to explode in frustration.'
2. Explain to the group that this exercise aims to discuss the ways people express their anger.
3. Direct participants to Participant Journal Activity 4.1 ('What Do I Do When I'm Angry?'). Read all the questions to all participants and ask them to answer the questions individually for five to seven minutes. For low-literacy or illiterate groups, ask the questions out loud and ask the participants to discuss them with each other in smaller groups or draw what they think.
4. While the participants are thinking and writing, write each of the following items at the top of its own flipchart paper:
- Negative ways to interact with others when we are angry
- Positive ways to interact with others when we are angry
5. Call the participants back together and ask them to share their answers and ideas first on negative ways and then on positive ways. Write down participants' responses. The participants will likely share some of the following positive ways:
- Taking deep breaths
- Counting to ten before you speak or act
- Using words to describe what we are feeling without harm
- Going for a walk alone or in some way distancing ourselves from the situation or the person we are angry with to calm down

Facilitator  Note: The angry person can take deep breaths, go for a short walk, or any other physical activity to calm themselves down. Generally, the angry person should mention to his partner or the person he is arguing with that he is going for a walk, saying something along the lines of, 'I'm really angry at you, and I need some fresh air. I need to walk a little bit so I won't feel violent or start screaming. When I calm down, we can discuss the problem together.' Another example for dealing with violence is expressing ourselves without insulting others. This entails explaining why we are angry and how we wish to solve the problem without insulting or hurting others. Give an example for the group: If your partner is late coming home, you can scream, 'You're an inconsiderate fool! You always do the same thing, and I stand here waiting for you!' or you can express your anger without insults and say, 'I'm angry because you are late. Next time you're late, please let me know before or call or text me instead of leaving me waiting.'

6. After the lists have been presented, ask the following Group Discussion Questions :
- It is difficult for many people, especially men, to express anger without using violence. Why is that?
- Are there any people you can look to as role models to learn from about how we express our emotions like anger in healthy ways?
- We generally know how to avoid a conflict or a fight without using violence. Why don't we apply that knowledge more often?
- Think back to the positive ways we discussed to interact with others to reduce the tension in conflicts. Have you used any of these approaches before? Do they work?
- Is it possible to use words without insults when we are angry? How can we be better at that, especially in moments when we are stressed or having a difficult time with something?
7. Read the Key Message : ' Anger is a natural emotion that everybody experiences throughout their lives.  The  problem  lies  when  some  people  manifest  or  act  out  their  anger  through  violence, thinking that violence is an acceptable way to express anger. Yet there are other, more positive ways to express anger. Learning to express our anger in a healthy way is better than bottling it up inside and not expressing it because if these feelings accumulate, they will result in an eruption of anger at a later stage.'

## PART 4: MINDFULNESS ACTIVITY: BALLOON PLAY (5 MINUTES)

Materials required: Balloons

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Balloon Play. During this exercise, they'll be working with a partner to keep their balloon from hitting the ground.
2. Have the participants get into pairs and stand face to face. Hand one person in the pair a blown-up balloon.
3. Tell the participant with the balloon to throw it to the other person, who will hit it back, explaining that the goal of the game is to keep the balloon in the air as long as they can.
4. Begin, reminding participants that the point of this exercise is to have fun and to really focus on the task at hand.

## PART 5: WEEKLY COMMITMENT (5 MINUTES)

1. Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'Pay close attention to your emotions this week. Which emotions are you comfortable expressing? Which emotions are difficult to express? When you express anger, especially with those close to you, how often is it really a manifestation of something else, such as sadness, frustration, or fear? And don't forget, you are doing your best. Struggling with these issues is not an admission of weakness, but an expression of strength and hope.'

## PART 6: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing their thoughts, questions, concerns, and experiences today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

## SESSION 4 IDENTIFYING VIOLENCE

<!-- image -->

30

CURRICULUM FOR FATHERS

## OBJECTIVES

- To identify different types of violence and to discuss the types of violence that most commonly occur against individuals, in families, between partners, between parents and children, and in communitiesTo discuss the link between violence that participants experienced in the past or are currently experiencing and the violence they inflict on others

## KEY ACTIVITIES AND TIMING

1. Welcome and Check-In - 15 minutes
2. What Is Violence? - 30 minutes
3. How Violence Has Affected My Life -  45  minutes
4. Mindfulness  Activity:  Affirmations  5  minutes
5. Circle  of  Appreciation,  Closing,  and Check-Out - 10 minutes

Total session time: 105 minutes

## PREPARATION FOR 'WHAT IS VIOLENCE?'

- In preparation for 'What Is Violence?' write down the definitions of violence (given in the body of the activity) on the flipchart paper. Cover these definitions with another piece of paper so the participants do not see them until you show them later.
- As noted in the materials, it is important to have a list of existing referral services on hand to offer participants who may need additional counseling, mental health, legal, psychosocial, and/ or support services for individuals experiencing violence.

Facilitator Note: Should you feel that the participants do not wish to share personal details, do not force them. Instead, ask them how another person would feel in the situation. Having experienced interpersonal violence is strongly associated with using violence against partners or  children  later.  Helping  participants  grasp  the  connection  and  think  about  the  pain  that violence has caused them, as well as empathizing with people they care about in their lives and how they may be hurting, is a potential way of interrupting the victim-aggressor cycle of violence.

- Before  this  activity,  identify  what  the  applicable  laws  are  (if  any)  around  violence,  especially gender-based  violence,  in  Kurdistan  and  Iraq.  Be  prepared  to  share  and  discuss  those  with participants  as  well  since  questions  may  come  up.
- Literacy  Note:  This  activity  requires  some  literacy/writing  ability,  so  be  aware  and  mindful  of participants'  levels  of  literacy.  If  you  feel  one  or  more  group  members  will  struggle,  explore alternative  ways  for  them  to  complete  the  activity.

## MATERIALS

- Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)
- Pieces  of  paper  or  sticky  notes  (at  least seven  per  participant,  but  ideally  more)
- Information about available counseling services, if any, for people who  have experienced violence
- Bucket or hat

## PREPARATION FOR 'HOW VIOLENCE HAS AFFECTED MY LIFE':

- Before the activity begins, set up five flipchart papers on the wall. On each paper, write one of the following phrases:
- How I feel when I use violence
- How I feel when violence is used against me
- In previous implementations of this session, it was much easier for men to talk about the violence they had suffered, particularly forms of violence that took place outside their homes. They felt a certain relief in being able to relay these experiences they had survived. Commenting on or talking about violence committed against them inside their homes was a more delicate matter. Some men commented on domestic violence; however, they did not want to go into details. It is important to be careful not to insist. For men, talking about violence they had committed was even more difficult. They tended to justify themselves, blaming the other person for being the aggressor.

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (15 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. First ask the group, 'Does anyone have a fun parenting story to share? Something successful you did, something funny your child did or said, or something they did that you are proud of?'
3. Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:
-  How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
4. Ask  participants  about  last  week's  commitment  to  pay  attention  to  their  emotions:  'Which emotions were you comfortable expressing? Which emotions were difficult to express? When you expressed anger, especially with those close to you, how often was it really a manifestation of something else, such as sadness, frustration, or fear?'
5. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## PART 2: WHAT IS VIOLENCE? (30 MINUTES)

1. Before anything else, explain: 'Today, we will be discussing different types of violence that exist and some of the ways we and others are affected by that violence. This topic is or can be uncomfortable or distressing for many of us. If at any time you need to take a moment to step outside and take a break from the discussion, for any reason, please go ahead without feeling the need to explain.'
2. Ask  the  group:  'What  is  violence?  What  examples  can  you  share?'  Allow  them  to  share  their opinions.  Write  down  the  participants'  responses  on  a  flipchart  paper.  If  participants  identify general  types  of  violence,  such  as  'physical,'  ask  them  for  specific  examples  of  this.

3. After everyone has shared, explain to the group: 'At its simplest level, violence is the way for one individual to have control or power over another. Violence is not a random act. It happens in specific circumstances and settings. Violence happens more frequently in some settings than others, such as during periods of conflict, but it is also very present in our homes and communities. Violence often occurs within the family and is often used by men against women and by parents against children, although these are not the only types of violence.'
4. Tell the group that most acts of interpersonal violence can be divided into several broad categories. Reveal the definitions of violence to the group:
- Physical violence: Using physical force, such as hitting, slapping, kicking, burning, or pushing.
- Emotional  or  psychological  violence:  Often  the  most  difficult  form  of  violence  to  identify. It  may  include  humiliating,  threatening,  insulting,  pressuring,  and  expressing  jealousy  or possessiveness,  such  as  controlling  decisions  and  activities.  It  can  also  include  restricting someone's  movements.  This  form  of  violence  can  be  verbal  or  nonverbal.
- Sexual violence: Pressuring or forcing someone to perform sexual acts (from kissing to sex) against their will or making sexual comments that make someone feel humiliated or uncomfortable. It does not matter if the person has previously consented to sexual behavior - consent must be given at the time.
- Social or economic violence: When someone else exercises complete or partial control over a person's money and other economic and social resources. This type of violence is a way of exerting power and can be used to control someone's movement: for example, keeping them from meeting friends, limiting access to school, or denying access to resources or opportunities.
5. Going down the brainstormed list, ask participants what type of violence the listed item is until all  items  have  been  categorized.  Then  lead  a  discussion  with  the  following Group Discussion Questions :
-  What are the most common types of violence used against women? Against men? Against children?  Within  families  or  communities?
- What types of honor violence do we see perpetrated in our community? Which of the types of violence we discussed are used as honor violence?
- How does honor-based violence relate to the types of violence we've discussed so far (whether causing, affecting, or impacting them in some way)?
- In what ways is forcing a girl to get married before she is old enough a kind of violence?

Facilitator Note: Probe for common types of violence committed against sons and daughters in  schools,  at  home,  and  on  the  street.  Talking  about  violence  against  children  can  be  even more taboo because many parents do not recognize and may be resistant to labeling 'small' or disciplinary kinds of violence - such as slapping on the wrist or spanking ('hitting that does not leave a mark') - as violence. Even small kinds of violence teach children that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflict or disagreement. These difficult moments are often the best times to teach our children better ways and focus on our long-term goals for our children. This will be discussed in more detail in Session 10 ('Positive Parenting'), and you may want to look ahead to that to help you respond if it comes up in this activity.

Facilitator  Note: It  is  important  that  participants  understand  that  both  men  and  women  use violence;  however, it  is  important  that  the  conversation  not  be  sidetracked  by  discussions  of women's violence against men. As the facilitator, you can explain to the group that while there are cases of women using violence against men, the overwhelming majority of violence is perpetrated by  men  against  women  and  children  and  that  its  drivers,  magnitude,  and  consequences  are significantly different. If the conversation becomes stuck on this issue, try to move the discussion along by asking another question.

## 6. Read the Key Messages :

- 'At its most basic level, violence is a way to control or have power over another person. People often only think about violence as physical aggression, but there are other forms of violence as well. Most often, this violence is targeted toward individuals or groups that are more vulnerable or marginalized in our communities.'
- 'Violence is a violation of a person's human rights, whether it is enacted against women, men, or children.'
- According to official data and statistics at the global, regional, and national levels, women are disproportionately affected by intimate partner violence, while the perpetrators of this type of violence as well as other types of crimes and violence (such as murder and sexual violence outside the home) are overwhelmingly men. Most men are not violent, but men in general often play a critical role in sustaining or challenging the legitimacy of using violence against women.'

## PART 3: HOW VIOLENCE HAS AFFECTED MY LIFE (45 MINUTES)

Facilitator Note: Check the literacy level of your group. If there is low literacy, have participants draw examples of violence on their pieces of paper or sticky notes. Alternatively, you can pair up participants to discuss the topics and then ask for feedback in the larger group discussion. The facilitator can then write the responses on the corresponding flipchart papers.

1. Explain  to  the  participants  that  the  purpose  of  this  activity  is  to  talk  about  the  violence  they experience in their lives and their communities, including the violence they have used and the violence used against them. Everything they say will be anonymous, and they are free to share as much or as little as they like, or not at all. The group will then discuss their feelings in relation to these types of violence. If necessary, review the flipchart paper from the previous activity that shows the different types of violence.
2. Give each participant five pieces of paper or sticky notes. Explain that there are five flipchart papers, and each represents one of the following titles:
- How I feel when I use violence
- How I feel when violence is used against me
3. Review the 2 categories and ask the participants to reflect on them and then write a short reply for each on a separate piece of paper. Each person should write at least one reply for each flipchart paper (or category). Allow about five minutes for this task. Explain that they should not write much, just a few words or a phrase. (They should not write their names.)
4. After five minutes, explain that they should put the phrases on the corresponding flipchart papers.
5. Tell participants to go on a 'gallery walk' to see what they and others have shared. However, stress that this is a silent activity, so there should be no discussion or laughter.
6. Once  everyone  has  finished  their  'gallery  walk,'  ask  them  to  return  to  their  seats  and  lead  a discussion  with  the  following Group  Discussion  Questions :
- As we have seen from the answers, experiencing violence hurts people. So why do men still use violence within our families and communities? What could be some alternatives to using violence to solve problems?
- Men sometimes use anger and other emotions (jealousy, frustration, honor) as an excuse for violence. Do you think this is justified?

- Some researchers say that violence is like a cycle; that is to say, someone who has experienced violence or who witnesses violence is more likely to commit acts of violence later on in life. If this is true, how can men interrupt this cycle of violence?
- What role do men have in preventing violence against women?

## Additional questions if there is time:

- What are the consequences for women who experience violence?
- What role do men and women have in preventing violence against children?
- What have you learned in this activity to help overcome violence? Have you learned anything that can be applied in your own life and relationships?
- In general, when men are violent or when they suffer violence, do they talk about it? Do they report it or know how or to whom they would report? Do they talk about how they feel? If they do not, why not?
7. Close the discussion with the following Key Messages:
- 'Too many people have experienced or witnessed violence at some point in their lives, often at the hands of men. It is commonly assumed that violence is a 'natural' or 'normal' part of being a man. However, violence is a learned behavior - boys, girls, women, and men are often raised to think that violence is an acceptable means of maintaining control, particularly over women and children, resolving conflicts, or expressing anger.'
- 'Just as violence is learned, it can be unlearned. With this in mind, it is the responsibility of all individuals, women and men, to strive to raise boys and men - as well as girls and women - to understand how violence prevents individuals from building positive and loving relationships.'
- 'Violence on an individual level is a behavior, which is learned and can be unlearned. It is the social responsibility of each individual to work on eliminating violence (at least those forms of violence that can be prevented by individuals) in the community, starting with oneself.'

## PART 4: MINDFULNESS ACTIVITY: AFFIRMATIONS (5 MINUTES)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Affirmations. During this activity, you will have them close their eyes and think about what they are thankful for.
2. Ask the participants to close their eyes and say: 'Think of one thing you are thankful for today. What makes you thankful for it? Whom do you have to be thankful to?' Give them 30 seconds to think.
3. Have them open their eyes and write what they are thankful for on a small piece of paper (or index card) without their name.
4. Collect these papers in a hat or bucket and read them aloud to the group.
5. Thank the group for their vulnerability and sharing what they are thankful for.

## PART 5: CIRCLE OF APPRECIATION, CLOSING, AND CHECK-OUT

## (10 MINUTES)

1. Ask everyone to stand up in a circle. Encourage everyone to stand so that they are shoulder to shoulder.
2. Tell participants:
- 'No one is in front or behind another person. We are all together - equal. Let's end this session with a 'check-out' in which each person can briefly say what was important to them during the session or one word on how they are feeling after this session.'
- 'Look around this circle and thank everyone for sharing their time today. Take a deep breath in appreciation of the honesty and compassion that we have shared together.'
- 'Now, we have the opportunity to take what we have learned and practiced together and share them with our family, friends, and colleagues. The changes we make inside ourselves are like a stone in a pond, creating ripples that affect everyone around us.'
3. Thank all participants for sharing their thoughts, questions, concerns, and experiences today.
4. Ask the group:
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
5. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
6. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
7. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.
8. Give the group the following Weekly Commitment (Facilitator Note: If you think this assignment would increase the risk of violence within the household, instead ask the participants to reflect on these topics on their own.): 'In the coming week, have a conversation with your partner and with (or instead with) your sons or daughters, if you are comfortable. During this conversation, you could share how you felt while remembering an act of verbal, psychological, or physical violence that was done against you. This would be an excellent opportunity to make a promise within the family that disagreements will always be resolved without using violence and with respect for the other person's right to disagree.'
9. If you have some, pass out brochures on where men and women can seek mental health services. Also  pass  out  brochures  with  information  on  seeking  services  for  intimate  partner  violence.  If any participant disclosed a particularly violent experience during this session, you should speak to  them privately after the session and ensure that they have the resources and referrals that they need.

- Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)

<!-- image -->

## PART 2: WHAT IS POWER? (35 MINUTES)

1. Explain to the group that in this activity, they are going to explore what power is and how it impacts the lives of men and women.
2. Ask the group: 'What does 'power' mean to you?' Allow the participants to exchange their ideas and opinions.
3. Next, ask the participants to close their eyes and think of a memory of a time they felt powerless.
4. After a minute, ask the participants (with their eyes still closed) to think of a memory of a time they felt powerful.
5. After a minute, tell the participants to open their eyes. Tell the group that participants will now have an opportunity to share some of their experiences. It is an important opportunity to remind the participants of the ground rules, particularly of confidentiality and empathy, but also of the importance of  participation.
6. Ask  the  group:  'How  does  it  feel  to  be  powerful?'  Allow  the  participants  to  share  how  being powerful feels. Ask if anyone would like to share their experience with the group or explain what situations make us feel powerful. Note that sharing is not required, only voluntary.
7. Next, ask the group: 'How does it feel to be powerless?' Allow the participants to share how being powerless feels. Ask if anyone would like to share their experience with the group or explain what situations make us feel powerless.

Facilitator  Note: The following  information  can  help  to  explain  feelings  of  being  powerful  or powerless.

| FEELING POWERFUL CAN FEEL LIKE BEING:                       | FEELING POWERLESS CAN FEEL LIKE BEING:                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| • In control • Knowledgeable • Brave • Big • Strong • Happy | • Small • Without any control • Unwanted • Fearful • Not confident • Sad |

8. After  the  group  has  shared  different  examples,  explain  that  power  can  be  positive  or  negative depending  on  a  person's  own  experience.
9. Explain to the group that there are four types of power. Read out the names of the four types of power (if available, you can write the four types of power on a flipchart paper):
-  Power over
-  Power to
-  Power with
- Power within
10.  Ask the participants to share their ideas about what each of the four types of power means, and where possible, to provide an example.

11.  After the group has had a chance to share their ideas and examples, read the definitions of each type of power to the group:

## Power over:

The power that one person or group uses to  control  another  person  or  group.  An example  would  be  the  culture  giving  a man power and the man using it to control his  family  members,  such  as  his  wife  and children,  including  through  violence.

## Power with:

The power that we have when two or  more  people  come  together  to  do something  that  they  could  not  do  alone (power together). This is a collective sense of empowerment through organizing and  uniting  for  a  common  purpose  or common  understanding.  'Power  with'  is experienced when a group comes together to tackle common  problems,  such  as access  to  latrines  or  creating  community centers.

## Power to:

The  beliefs  and  actions  that  individuals and groups use to create positive change. This  kind  of  power  is  behind  the  concept of  empowerment.  'Power  to'  enables  a person to gain control over his or her life. An example would be an individual teaching another community member about how to grow  products,  such  as  mushrooms.

## Power within:

The power that lives within  an  individual. It  is  a  personal  strength  and  uniqueness based on self-acceptance and self-respect, which in turn extends to respect for others and  acceptance  of  others  as  equals.  It  is different  than  'power  to'  in  that  it  refers to individuals finding strength and positive change  within  themselves,  while  'power to' refers to strength and change for other individuals.

12.  Divide participants into pairs. Ask each pair to discuss with each other examples of times when they have used or experienced each of these types of power.
13.  Give the pairs five minutes to discuss.
14. After five minutes, ask everyone to come back to the larger group.
15.  Ask for a few volunteers to share examples of when they have used or experienced each type of power.
16.  Thank the volunteers for sharing and then ask some of the Group Discussion Questions:
- Did you notice any similarities or differences among the examples that were shared?
- In what ways are men powerful?
-  In what ways are women powerful?
- Is there a difference in how men use power and how women use power?
- Who normally has power in society? Who normally does not have power?
- What are some of the ways that our society promotes or supports relationships in which some people have power over other people?
- How do power imbalances affect us in our relationships with other people?
- How can people work together to generate more positive uses of power?
- How might children feel powerless? How can parents help their children feel less powerless?
17.  Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the Key Message: 'Power has many different faces and meanings. Power often exists in relation to

other people. We are constantly moving in and out of situations and relationships in which we have more or less power. Sometimes, we use power in ways that are harmful to those around us, and sometimes, other people use their power in ways that are harmful to us. However, each of us has the ability to use power in positive ways. We can work together to make positive changes that can help to develop our families and communities.'

## PART 3: SHARING POWER IN DECISION-MAKING (40 MINUTES)

1. Divide the participants into three to four smaller groups. Ask for a volunteer in each group who will present a summary of what the group discusses to the larger group.
2. Once the groups have been divided, ask the following questions for them to discuss in their small groups:
- Are there household decisions you would like to share more with your wife? If so,
- what types of decisions?
- How can men better incorporate their children's opinions into their decision making at home?
- What benefits would you and your family gain by sharing decision-making power?
3. After the small groups have finished discussing, ask the participants to come back to the circle.
4. Ask the group if anyone would like to comment on what was shared. Then, ask some of the Group Discussion Questions:
- What are some of the negative impacts when men are the main decision-makers in the family (probe for the impacts of men, women, and children)?
- If  only  one  person  from  the  family  makes  all  the  major  decisions,  how  does  this  negatively impact the family as a whole?
- Do you think it is realistic for men and women to share decision-making power within the family? Why or why not?

## If you have time you can also ask:

- How can men and women sharing power and responsibility reduce violence in the family and community?
- How can you balance what you think is right for your child vs what they want to do?

Facilitator Note: Through the discussion, encourage participants to think of the different benefits or advantages to men and women sharing decisions, including how joint decision-making can benefit men, women, and children.

5. After the discussion has concluded, end the activity by thanking the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas, and then share the Key Messages:
- 'Men are often raised to be the head of the household and to have the final say in household decisions. As such, men often control access to, use of, and decisions about household finances, resources, marriage of children, and even how family members spend their time. This can have a negative impact on women, children, and men themselves.'
- 'However, there  are  many  benefits  that  come  when  men  and  women  participate  equally  in decisions that affect themselves and their families. It is often easier to make decisions when you can discuss and advise each other. Your spouse will have a different perspective and may have additional information, both of which ensure the best possible decision is made. It also reduces the burden on one person to make decisions and increases shared accountability and decreases blame. Equitable decision-making requires sharing power between men and women, but it brings many positive benefits and better relationships for men, women, children, and the household in general.'

- 'Equitable household decision-making means men and women sharing power, discussing, and agreeing on decisions together. Not all decisions need to be made in this way. For example, there  are  important  decisions  that  each  person  should  be  able  to  make  for  themselves, particularly those regarding their own bodies and their time. However, when men and women make important decisions affecting the household together, it is easier to achieve the goals that they have for their families.'

## PART 4: WEEKLY COMMITMENT (5 MINUTES)

1. Explain the Weekly Commitment:
- 'In  the  coming  week,  take  some  time  to  think  of  one  or  two  aspects  of  family  life  in  which decisions affecting the family are traditionally made by men but that you will share or make together with your spouse. Talk about what kind of decision-making process you can implement that will help you come to the best decisions and what information you both need to make those  decisions.'
- 'In  addition,  try  to  identify  a  family  decision  that  is  usually  made  without  the  input  of  your children and think how you might be able to include them in that decision-making process, and what the benefits could be to that.'

## PART 5: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing their thoughts, questions, concerns, and experiences today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

## SESSION 6 RESOLVING CONFLICT

<!-- image -->

SEED FOUNDATION

43

## OBJECTIVES

- To  discuss  the  common  topics  or  sources  of  conflict  between  spouses/partners  and  how identifying  these  sources  can  help  to  avoid  or  reduce  conflict  within  the  family
- To reflect on some of the positive and negative ways that we react when we are angry and to practice nonviolent ways to react that can help to resolve or avoid conflict
- To identify nonviolent ways to resolve conflict and to reflect on the importance of communication and strong relationships when we face difficult moments as fathers and husbands

## KEY ACTIVITIES AND TIMING

1. Welcome and Check-In - 10 minutes
2. Sources  of  and  Ways  to  Resolve Family Conflict -  65  minutes
3. Mindfulness Activity: Self-Massage 5 minutes
4. Weekly Commitment - 5 minutes
5. Closing and Check-Out - 5 minutes

Total session time: 90 minutes

## MATERIALS

- Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)

## PREPARATION

- Think  about  sources  of  conflict  in  your family  and  others  you  have  seen,  as  well as some of the ways you and your partner effectively  resolve  conflict.  How  have  you learned about and gotten better at resolving conflict  in  your  life?

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:
-  How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
3. Ask participants about last week's commitment: 'Did anyone think of family decisions that you could make more equally or that you could make with greater input from your children? If so, please share with the group, if you feel comfortable, how that discussion went. What was the decision? How will the decision-making process be different in the future?'
4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## PART 2: SOURCES OF AND WAYS TO RESOLVE FAMILY CONFLICT (65 MINUTES)

1. Tell the group 'Before we start this activity, I would like to know what you feel are the main topics or sources of conflict between spouses in this community.' Write down participants' answers on a flipchart paper and have them identify the four most common sources of conflict.
2. Then, tell the group: 'Breaking the cycle of violence requires finding new ways of resolving conflict that do not involve violence or aggression. Communicating our feelings is a very important way to resolve conflict and can even help us to avoid conflict in the first place. A few weeks ago, we did an activity that helped us think of positive ways to express our anger. We will now discuss and rehearse the next step after we have controlled our anger: positive ways of communicating to resolve conflict - ways that can be used not only in our relationships with our spouses but also with friends, family members, and others.'
3. Ask the group the following questions:
- Why is communication in a relationship important?
- What happens when we can communicate directly with our partner?
- How might our partner feel if we do not communicate that we are upset?
- How might we feel or what might happen if we do not communicate that we are upset?
- Do problems disappear if we don't talk about them?
4. After  the  group  has  finished  discussing,  present  the  following  three  types  of  communication responses  to  conflict:
- Avoidance: Avoiding the topic that has made us upset; pushing our feelings inside ourselves because we do not want to talk about it
- Escalation: Arguing, raising your voice, or even becoming violent
- Empathy:  Understanding  a  situation  from  the  other  person's  perspective;  seeing  through someone  else's  eyes
5. Explain:
- We want to strive for empathy in our responses to conflict. Empathy can help us communicate with our partners when we are angry or when we have a conflict. Empathy means understanding a situation from another person's point of view.
- To do that, it is helpful to express our own feelings in a calm way by using 'I' statements. These can be statements starting with, for example, 'I feel,' 'I want,' or 'I see.' These statements help the other person to know where you are coming from and present the situation in a non-blaming manner. Some statements could be 'I see that you are very busy,' 'I feel frustrated about what happened,' or 'I want to understand what is bothering you.'
- It may be important to take a moment to think about how you are actually feeling and then find the words to communicate your feelings in a constructive way, allowing the other person to see the situation through your eyes. This includes not blaming the other person for the situation or focusing on their actions. Rather, it is important to talk about your perspective and how the situation has affected you. This usually avoids escalating the situation into an argument because you are trying to understand the other person's point of view and you are clearly communicating yours.

6. Using the following table, facilitators should role play the differences between 'you' statements and 'I' statements for the group and ask if they have any questions.

| EXAMPLES OF 'YOU' STATEMENTS AND 'I' STATEMENTS                    | EXAMPLES OF 'YOU' STATEMENTS AND 'I' STATEMENTS                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 'You always leave your mess lying everywhere.                      | 'I feel anxious when I come home and the house is messy.'                                            |
| 'You don't care about meor my feelings.'                           | 'I feel frustrated when my feelings aren't heard or acknowledged.'                                   |
| 'You didn't call melike you said you would!'                       | 'I feel worried when I don't hear from you, and I just want to know that you're OK and safe.'        |
| 'You embarrassed meat dinner the other night, like you always do.' | 'I felt really embarrassed the other night in front of our friends when this topic came up because…' |
| 'You never tell mehowyou're feeling.'                              | 'I would love to know how you're feeling about this.'                                                |

Facilitator Note: The following activity involves participants role-playing, which can be awkward for  some.  The  point  of  the  activity  is  for  them  to  practice  their  communication  skills  and  'I' statements. If the participants are not comfortable at all doing the role-plays, the facilitator could just model this scenario with one participant in front of the group. Alternatively, pairs could roleplay but do it not in front of the whole group. (In this case, the facilitator should still go around and observe each pair.)

7. Ask the group: 'Do you think these phrases could be useful for you to communicate when you have conflicts in your relationship? Why or why not?'
8. Divide the participants into four groups. Explain that each group will have two or three minutes to role-play a healthy relationship, using communication - rather than violence or aggression - to resolve a conflict. Explain that each group will be asked to create a scene in which two people are quarreling about a topic and both become angry. The role-play should show the pair communicating to resolve the conflict without resorting to violence: Think about how the couple would act and what they would say. What phrases would they use? Encourage the participants to also include some of the strategies for managing anger that they discussed in the previous activity.
9. Give each group one of the top four topics from the list made at the beginning of the activity.
10.  Give the groups ten minutes to develop their role-play on resolving the conflict through discussion and communication. (See the earlier facilitator note if the men are apprehensive about role-playing.)
11.  After ten minutes, ask everyone to come back to the circle and have each group present their role-play  in  turn.
12.  As the groups present their role-plays, the facilitator should list on a flipchart paper some of the positive, nonviolent ways they communicated, including particular phrases that were useful. Share with the group other strategies for nonviolence, including some of the breathing and mindfulness activities that they have been going through during the sessions. Other strategies include taking a  moment to cool down before engaging in the conversation, being mindful of your tone and volume when speaking and of your body language (don't point at the other person, look annoyed, etc.), taking a break during the conversation if it's escalating, or seeking an outside mediator.

13.  After  all  the  groups  have  presented,  open  up  the  discussion  using  these Group  Discussion Questions:
- What were some of the ways that you all communicated their feelings during the role-plays in positive, nonviolent ways?
- Do you think that these techniques of conflict resolution would be possible between a husband and wife? Why or why not?
- Do we always know why our partner is upset? Does our partner always know why we are upset? What are the benefits of communicating your feelings during a conflict?
-  How can we remember to 'see through someone else's eyes' when we are angry with our partners  and  our  children?

Facilitator Note: Refer back to the sessions on power and what it means to be a man if the participants don't include these topics themselves. You may also note that men are often raised not to discuss their feelings and with the idea that they should be the primary decision-makers in  the family. This can contribute to a lack of communication between partners, leading both partners to have unclear expectations of each other, which can contribute to conflict.

Additional questions if you have time:

- Do you think it would be easy for a woman to express her feelings during an argument? Why or why not?
- Do you think it would be easy for a man to express his feelings during an argument? Why or why not?
- Do you think you could use these skills for communicating in real life? Why or why not?
- How  can  these  communication  methods  lead  to  concrete  problem-solving  in  couple relationships?  How  can  they  help  us  in  disagreements  with  our  children?
- What else can be done to address the common causes of disagreement between partners and between parents and children?
14. Close the activity with the Key Messages:
- 'Conflict always exists, but it does not need to be violent or angry and can be an opportunity for  personal  growth  and  development  rather  than  an  opportunity  for  violence.  When  we communicate with each other, we can resolve conflict  peacefully  and  avoid  future  conflict.'
- 'Sometimes when we are sad or frustrated, we don't talk about it. Very often, by not talking, the frustration or anger builds up until it is expressed through physical aggression or shouting.'
- 'Communication is a key part of healthy relationships. Communicating our feelings to the other person is an important part of resolving conflict and is much more effective than violence. Take the time to talk to your partner and to listen to them. When we communicate, we can often stop a conflict before it starts or resolve it without resorting to violence.'

## PART 3: MINDFULNESS ACTIVITY: SELF-MASSAGE (5 MINUTES)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Self-Massage.

## PREPARATION

- Reflect  on  your  knowledge  of  and  history with honor-based violence and honor killings before this activity so you are mentally prepared  to  address  the  topic.  Also  think about strategies you have used, or would be comfortable  using,  in  challenging  harmful activities  like  honor-based  violence  in  your community:  What  strategies  do  you  find effective  in  trying  to  change  the  minds  of friends and family members? The session will be more effective if you share your successes and  challenges  with  participants.
- Literacy  Note: This  activity  requires  some literacy/writing ability, so be aware and mindful  of  participants'  levels  of  literacy.  If you  feel  one  or  more  group  members  will struggle, explore alternative ways for them to complete  the  activity.

## PART 2: VALUES WE RESPECT (20 MINUTES)

1. Start the activity by asking the group 'What are characteristics that you respect or appreciate of other men?' (Some answers could be: problem solving, closeness with the family, kindness, loyalty, keeping your word, love) Write the answers on a flipchart. (Note: if 'family honor' is mentioned, you can ask participants to unpack that word and use those words. We will be discussing honor in depth later in the session.)
2. Split the group into groups of 2-3 people. Assign one of the characteristics to each group and task them with answering these two questions:
- Why do people value this about others?
- How can we embody this more in our friendships and family?
3. Give each group 10 minutes to discuss this and then present it back to the plenary.
4. Begin with the following Group Discussion Questions :
- Why do men want to feel respected in their community?
- What are the similarities and differences in the reasons why we respect women in our community?

## PART 3: HONOR AND VIOLENCE (40 MINUTES)

1. Tell  the  group:  'We  just  spoke  about  a  variety  of  characteristics  that  we  value  about  men  and women in society. I want to now discuss how honor fits into this situation.' Ask:
- What role does 'honor' play in men's lives? What does it mean for us to be honorable?
- How are we expected to police or enforce honor in our family and our society?
- What is the cost to men, women, and children of these expectations of honor? (See the following facilitator note for examples of the cost to men.)

Facilitator  Note: Usually  the  cost  to  women  and  children  of  honor  killings  is  clear,  but  it  is important to note the ways honor-based violence harms men, including that men can be victims of honor-based violence; men are often coerced to kill their own sisters; men commit crimes under fear or threat of violence; men are forced to marry cousins or someone they do not love; and men are sometimes forced to take responsibility for something done by another relative, especially if that relative is a minor and likely to receive a lighter punishment. Arhe Hamednaca, a Swedish-Eritrean activist against honor killings, puts it poignantly: 'The worst thing that could happen to a boy, when a sister commits a crime…is that the entire family sits down and decides that it is his task to kill the girl. He is forced to do it. And I think that most of them do it against their own will.…The grade of victimhood may not be the same as the girls' , but they are victims too.'

2. Say: 'In some of our communities, one main cost related to these expectations of honor is the act of Honor killings and other forms of honor-based violence Although most men do not directly participate in honor-based violence, the system of belief that underpins it is part of most of our lives to some degree. Today, I'd like for us to discuss some aspects of honor, especially how it relates to what it means to be a man.'

3. Ask the following Discussion Questions:
- Is honor-based violence actually accomplishing what it is supposed to? Is it worth the costs that it has?
- What prevents men from trying to end honor-based violence? (if religion is brought up, see facilitator  note  below)
- Why should we as men play a role in trying to end honor-based violence?
- What example have we seen of men who have pushed back against or challenged honor-based violence? What did they do?

Facilitator Note: Some participants may cite their religious beliefs as a justification for honorbased  violence.  However,  as  a  Canadian  government  report  on  honor-based  violence  in  the country notes: 'There is no mention of honor killing in the Quran or Hadiths. Honor killing, in Islamic definitions, refers specifically to extra-legal punishment by the family against a woman, and is forbidden by the Sharia (Islamic law). Religious authorities disagree with extra punishments such as honor killing and prohibit it, so the practice of it is a cultural and not a religious issue.'

Additionally, Jonathan Brown, a Muslim scholar and professor of Islamic studies, notes in his book Misquoting Muhammad : 'No Muslim scholar of any note, either medieval or modern, has sanctioned a man killing his wife or sister for tarnishing her or the family's honor.' The Canadian government report also notes that honor killings are unknown in many Muslim countries: 'In Indonesia, generally believed to be the country with the largest Muslim population, honor killings are unknown, as is the case in parts of West Africa with majority-Muslim populations and in many other Islamic countries such as Bangladesh.'

4. Give the groups about ten minutes to discuss (more if they need it). After the discussion, go over the ways to stop honor-based violence included in the box below.

Facilitator Note: Hopefully, the groups will come up with lots of ideas, but here are additional things you can add if they are helpful. This list is also Journal Resource Page 8.1.

## Taking a Positive and Personal Approach

Talk with friends and family about the alternatives to honor-based violence you use or would use, including trusting and empowering your wife and children.

Talk with friends and family about how you would never hurt or kill (or ask anyone else to hurt or kill) a relative for any reason, including honor, and why.

Publicly embrace others who have been negatively affected by or rejected due to honor-based violence.

## Proactively Building a Movement

Cultivate allies among your friends and family who are also against honor-based violence so you can work together when and if needed to prevent others from using it. Don't wait until something is already happening to try and find allies. Know who will support you (socially, economically, politically, and otherwise) and with whom you can stand together to publicly reject honor-based violence.

Offer honorable alternatives to honor-based violence that can accomplish the same things.

Seek out and cultivate high-status community leaders who also reject honor-based violence. At key times, you can ask them to add their voice to help convince others and to act as a mediator to prevent violence.

## Withdrawing Participation

Refuse  to  participate  in  honor-based  discussions  when  they  turn  toward  using  violence  and explain  why  to  those  participating.

Reject others who try to impose what you perceive as excessive honor-based norms upon you, your family, your friends, and your community.

## Openly Challenging Honor-Based Violence

Speak up about your opposition to honor-based violence with friends and family, such as when a story about it is in the news or it happens to someone you know. You could speak about it with a group of people or one on one depending on your comfort level. Don't wait until the issue is directly affecting your family. Speak up before it does!

5. Remain in a discussion about honor or honor-based violence when the dialogue turns toward using violence, but express disagreement with those approaches.

After each group has spoken, ask if there are any additional thoughts or things someone would like to add. Tell participants that some of the strategies here can be useful when confronting other forms of violence in the family or community.

6. Close by sharing the Key Messages:
- 'Many people, including many men, are deeply uncomfortable with honor killings and honorbased violence. But due to entrenched social norms, most men don't say anything about it, or they even go along with it. However, as we have discussed today, honor-based violence is deeply detrimental to men, women, and children and society as a whole.'
- 'In most instances, the fear that men have of what will happen to them if they challenge a social norm is far worse than the actual consequences. And if we do not resist now and speak up against it when it isn't directly affecting us, it may be used later against us or someone we love, and by then, it will be too late to resist. And we should not try or expect to solve this alone. We must mobilize others as well.'

## PART 4: MINDFULNESS ACTIVITY: CHECKING IN (5 MINUTES)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Checking In.
2. Ask the participants to close their eyes if they are comfortable and take three deep, long breaths.
3. Ask  them  to  think  about  the  following  questions.  Pause  for  20  seconds  between  each  of  the questions.
- How is my body feeling?
- Is there anything bothering or upsetting me?
- How have I practiced self-care today?
- What do I need right now?
- What things I am thankful for and why?
4. Ask them to take another three deep, long breaths and open their eyes.

## PART 5: WEEKLY COMMITMENT (5 MINUTES)

1. Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'Share your thoughts about honor-based violence with another person who you know or think might agree with you. Discuss what you can do together to prevent honor-based violence in your family or community.'

## PART 6: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing their thoughts, questions, concerns, and experiences today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

## SESSION 8 COMMUNICATING WITH MY FAMILY

<!-- image -->

SEED FOUNDATION

55

## OBJECTIVES

- To reflect on the importance of communication, interaction, and affection between fathers and their sons
- To develop skills for more effective communication between parents and young people
- To  reflect  on  participants'  goals  for  themselves  and  their  family;  on  young  men's  goals  for themselves and their future; and on how young men and adult men can work together to achieve their  long-term family vision
- This session was designed for fathers and sons to come together and participate jointly. If the project design does not allow for that, this session as written can be facilitated with fathers only.
- There  is  an  alternative  session  in  the  youth  curriculum  called  'Session  9  ALTERNATIVE'  that should  be  done  instead,  if  fathers  and  sons  don't  jointly  participate.

## KEY ACTIVITIES AND TIMING

1. Welcome and Check-In - 10 minutes
2. Communicating  as  a  Family  -  60 minutes
3. Our Family Vision - 45 minutes
4. Weekly Commitment - 5 minutes
5. Closing and Check-Out - 5 minutes

Total session time: 125 minutes

## PREPARATION

- Print copies of Journal Resource Page 9.1 for all participants.
- If  this  session  includes young men, make sure to meet with the facilitator of the groups for young men beforehand to discuss how your groups have gone so far and to prepare to facilitate together.
- Think about your own experiences communicating with your parents and other adults when you were younger and, if you are a parent, how you and your children communicate with each other. Make a few notes about what works and doesn't work for you so you can share them with participants.
- Take a few moments to think about your vision for your family and times when you have discussed your family vision with your partner and children so you can share your own experiences with the group as well. If you have not done this before, take some time to do so in the week leading up to the session.
- Literacy Note: This activity requires some literacy/writing ability, so be aware and mindful of participants'  levels  of  literacy.  If  you  feel  one  or  more  group  members  will  struggle,  explore alternative ways for them to complete the activity.
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)
- Paper and pens/pencils for all participants
- Copies of Journal Resource Page 9.1 ('Communicating  as  a  Family')  for  each participant

<!-- image -->

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. If young men are attending, go around and have all participants introduce themselves and who their father/son is. Some men may want to introduce their sons, but make sure that each person introduces  himself.
3. Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:
-  How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
4. Ask participants if anyone had a conversation during the last week about honor-based violence and how it can be prevented in the community. If so, how did it go?
5. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## PART 2: COMMUNICATING AS A FAMILY (60 MINUTES)

1. Tell the group: 'Before we start this activity, I would like to know what you feel are the main topics or sources of conflict between parents, especially fathers, and their teenage sons.' Write down participants' answers on a flipchart paper and have them identify the top five or six most common sources of conflict.
2. Continue:  'Communication  between  parents  and  their  children  is  often  challenging  for  both groups. Teenagers want to assert their independence, try new things, be curious and explore, and do things they enjoy. They are looking ahead to a time when they will be more financially independent and perhaps move out and have a family of their own. And all of that is perfectly normal developmentally. Parents, on the other hand, worry that children will end up in a dangerous situation, may hurt themselves or someone else, or will end up with problems at school or in the community. And it can be hard for parents to admit their child is growing up. Parents are doing what they feel is best, but their children often see it as unfair, overly restrictive, or simply not making any sense.'
3. Then, say: 'In a moment we are going to break into groups of four or six people each. In each group should be two or three adult men and two or three young men, none of whom are related to each other. I want each group to select one of the sources of conflict between parents and children we just listed and to create a role-play based on that. You should create two role-plays of the same scenario.'
- 'In the first role-play, show the conflict the way it often happens, with parents and children not understanding each other, getting frustrated, and perhaps even shouting.'
- 'In  the  second  version,  show  the  conflict  but  with  both  parties  seeing  it  from  the  other's perspective, not getting frustrated, and trying to reach a solution that makes both parties happy. Perhaps each person compromises on their stance a little bit so that they meet in the middle. Demonstrate at least one, or even more, ways to constructively reach a solution. I want everyone to try using empathy, which is understanding a situation from the other person's perspective. And above all, be realistic. Don't make up a scenario that you don't believe would work in real life. '
4. Continue: 'There is just one condition: In your role-plays, the young men will play the role of fathers, and the fathers will play the role of young men. We are going to try hard to put ourselves in the other person's shoes and see the situation from their perspective, and at the same time, explore how you can avoid escalating the situation and making it worse.'
5. Break participants into groups of 4-6 fathers and give them 7 minutes to brainstorm and practice their scenario. After 7 minutes, bring the groups back together and perform one by one.

6. After each role-play, discuss it with the broader group and make a list of what the participants did to reach a solution that both parties could accept.
7. After all the role-plays, share Journal Resource Page 9.1 ('Communicating as a Family'). Give the group a few minutes to read it, and then ask the following Group Discussion Questions:
- What do you think about the list? Do you think some of the suggestions would really work? Which ones and why?
- Can you think of any situations in your life now where using some of these might help you communicate  with  your  children?
- Are there any suggestions that you think would not work as well? Why not?
-  How can we remember to 'see through someone else's eyes' when we are angry with each other?
-  What else can be done to address the common causes of disagreement between fathers and sons?
8. Close the activity by sharing the following Key Messages:
- 'Empathy means understanding a situation from another person's point of view. To do that, it  is  helpful  to  express  our  own  feelings  in  a  calm  way,  such  as  'I  can  see  that  you  are  very busy,' 'I feel frustrated about what happened,' or 'I want to understand what is bothering you.' Communicating our feelings in a constructive way allows the other person to see the situation from our eyes.'
- 'Communicating our feelings is a very important way of resolving conflict and can even help us to avoid conflict in the first place. It is also more effective than using violence.'
- 'Conflict always exists, but it does not need to be violent or angry and can be an opportunity for  personal  growth  and  development  rather  than  an  opportunity  for  violence.  When  we communicate with each other, we can resolve conflict  peacefully  and  avoid  future  conflict.'

## PART 3: OUR FAMILY VISION (45 MINUTES)

1. Explain that in this activity, each person will think about the goals they have for their family and will talk about their shared vision for the future.
2. Ask the participants to close their eyes. Read the following statements aloud slowly so that the group members can consider each sentence as you read them: 'Imagine it is five years from now…'

| QUESTIONS FOR FATHERS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | QUESTIONS FOR YOUNG MEN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| • What are the things you hope to have achieved in that time? • What are your hopes for yourself? What are your hopes for your partner and for your children? • What does your relationship with your partner look like? • What does your relationship with your children look like? • How do you care for each other? How do you help each other? • How do you speak to and listen to each other? | • What are the things you hope to have achieved in that time? • What are your hopes for yourself? • What does your relationship with your family look like? • Will you have a spouse and children as well? What will your relationship with them be like? • How do you care for each other? How do you help each other? • How do you speak to and listen to each other? |

3. Ask the participants to keep their eyes closed and think about this vision for the future and what it looks like.
4. Ask the group:
- How did it feel to have a vision of your and your family's future?
- Do you think your family has similar visions to your own?
5. Next, ask each participant to come up with two or three long-term goals they want themselves and their family to achieve. If they prefer, participants can write these goals down on paper or draw them, but this is not required.
6. After everyone has finished, ask if anyone would like to share their personal and family vision and goals with the group.
7. Allow enough time for participants who want to share their family vision to do so. Remember, sharing is  not  required.

Facilitator  Note: After  each  person  has  shared,  you  may  invite  other  participants  to  provide positive, constructive feedback on group members' visions, guided by the group agreements.

8. Ask some of the following Group Discussion Questions :
- Is it common for men and women, or parents and their children, to discuss the vision they have for their family's future and how they can work together to achieve it? Why or why not? Why might it be beneficial to do this more?
- How important is it for men and women to have a shared vision and work together for the development  and  well-being  of  the  family?
- How can fathers and sons support each other to achieve their visions?
- Do traditional gender roles, or expectations of how men and women should behave, make it difficult for men and women to achieve their family vision? If so, how?
- How can men's participation in caring for children and doing household chores help contribute to achieving the family vision?
- How can your participation in these meetings help contribute to achieving your family vision?
9. Thank  the  participants  for  sharing  their  experiences  and  ideas.  Share  the  Key  Message: 'Communication between family members is important for setting goals for your family. Men and women working together as a couple - such as supporting each other to work, sharing household responsibilities, and encouraging each other as parents - can help you to achieve these goals and support the health, happiness, and economic prosperity of your family. And bringing your children into the discussion, hearing their hopes and dreams, can help clarify that vision and make it easier for parents to support their children.'

## PART 4: WEEKLY COMMITMENT (5 MINUTES)

Explain  the Weekly  Commitment: 'Try  and  apply  some  of  this  week's  lessons,  discussion,  and communication skills in your interactions with each other during the coming week. Notice what works and areas in which you can develop your skills more. Also, share your vision for your family's future with other members of your family and ask them to share theirs with you. How are yours similar and different?'

## PART 5: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing their thoughts, questions, concerns, and experiences today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

## Facilitator Note:

This topic often elicits very strong reactions. Remember in your facilitation that we are not trying to shame people for what they did in the past, but to help them learn to do better in the future. Focus on how positive parenting is better for children emotionally and developmentally and more effective at achieving the goals parents have for their children.

Another thing that parents often bring up is 'I was spanked/slapped/whipped as a child and I turned out fine. I'm doing great!' The psychologist interviewed in this article gives an excellent response to that:

'Let's be realistic, most people who were spanked were spanked as children. And as everyone likes to tell me, they turned out okay. And me included. I think I turned out okay despite being spanked.

'The question is: Did other things counter balance the spanking?

'I  don't  think  we learn to be good people who care about others by being hit. … [We learn from our parents,] who talk to us about the value and the morality of sharing with other people and taking turns and thinking about others' feelings.

'We know now that children need to be in car seats and seat belts. But those of us who grew up in the 1970s were in cars that didn't even have seat belts. Do I think my parents were bad parents for not putting me in a seat belt? No, because no one understood how important seat belts were to protecting children. Do I think I 'turned out okay' because I wasn't in a seat belt? No - I think I was lucky. It's the same with spanking.

'We turned out okay in spite of being spanked, not because of it.'

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:
-  How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
3. Ask  participants  about  last  week's  commitment:  'Were  any  of  you  able  to  use  your  new communication skills in interactions with your family? And did you discuss your family visions with your  spouse  or  children?'
4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## PART 2: POSITIVE PARENTING SKILLS (75 MINUTES)

## Section 1: Introduction

1. Explain to participants: 'For the past few weeks, we have improved our understanding of how to communicate effectively with our partners and our families. We have also talked about how a father is more than just a provider - men are parents who are equally capable of providing an emotionally and developmentally safe environment in which their children can thrive and grow. We talked a lot last week about how to provide a loving, nurturing environment when young people are going through the life changes of puberty and how we can support them.'

2. Continue: 'However, challenges are inevitable. Parents will experience, and probably already have, challenges when children do not always do what parents ask, even when they give them praise.'
3. Ask participants to share some of the biggest challenges they have had in getting their adolescents to behave: for example, 'My kids never seem to listen to what I say,' 'Adolescents can be very demanding - they want everything,' or 'Young people always seem distracted by technology!'
4. Emphasize: 'There are no bad children, only difficult behaviors. Children are not inherently bad. They  are  just  behaving  in  inappropriate  or  difficult  ways,  in  many  instances  because  they  are struggling to communicate in more effective ways - just as we have been speaking about how we as adults can struggle to communicate in the best or most effective ways. And when we speak about discipline for children, it is important to remember that a specific moment of a young person doing something wrong, and a parent responding, is only one percent of what we think of as discipline. Effective discipline is about the environment we create, incentives and disincentives, opportunities, teaching lessons, and of course, love and affection. If we only focus on the moment a young person is disobedient, then we will inevitably fail.'
5. Also discuss that a role that often falls to the father is to be the disciplinarian in the family. Ask: 'What does being a disciplinarian have to do with society's expectations about being a man?' For example, traditionally (though not for all families), fathers are seen as the ones who enforce the rules and create a sense of order and respect in the family.
6. Ask participants: 'What are the common ways men discipline their children, especially when they become angry or frustrated? What about women? Does this ever depend on whether it is a girl or a boy?' State that when children misbehave, parents commonly yell, threaten, or even hit children and young people. This can interfere with parents' long-term goals.
7. Explain: 'There are better and more effective ways to discipline children than hitting, slapping, or shouting at them. Those methods are not just wrong but also counterproductive. Striking a child does not teach them to behave, it teaches them that…'
- 'We communicate important things by hitting.'
- 'Hitting is an acceptable response to anger.'
- 'The people they depend on to protect them will sometimes hurt them.'
- 'They should fear their parents rather than trust them to help and teach.'
- 'Their home is an unsafe place for learning and exploration.'
- 'Even if children comply, they are doing so out of fear, not out of respect, love, or understanding. Think about how it feels to be hit as an adult. We feel humiliated. We don't feel motivated to please and learn from the person who hit us; we feel resentment and fear. So today, we will talk about 'positive parenting,' specifically for young adolescents.'
8. Ask if there are any questions. Then, ask participants the following:
-  What are some ways to communicate with your youth even when they are misbehaving?
- Thinking back to our previous sessions, what are some relevant lessons that we already learned? (i.e., violence, power, honor, emotions, etc.)
9. Say to the group: 'It is important to prevent misbehavior by setting your expectations and rules for their behavior ahead of time and be sure they are capable and knowledgeable of what they are asking you to do.'

## Section 2: Role-Plays

10.  Tell them they will prepare a realistic role-play scene between a young person and a parent. The young person is misbehaving, and the parent must use positive discipline techniques to address the unwanted behavior. To develop their role-play, after they read the scenario, they should think about the following:
- What are some other possible reasons (based on age, development, etc.) he or she might be acting this way? Just as we discussed earlier in our group, sometimes we express a behavior or emotion (such as anger) even though what we are feeling is another one (such as sadness or frustration).
- Is my goal here to punish my child or to educate them so they will behave better in the future? What positive behavior would I like to see instead of this negative behavior?
- What actions, both now and in the future, should I take if I want to see more of the positive behavior and less of the negative one?
- What action can I take that is consistent with showing love and affection for my child?
11.  Give  the  participants  ten  minutes  to  plan  their  role-play.  After  ten  minutes,  ask  the  groups  to present  their  role-plays.
12.  After the role-plays, open the discussion using the Group Discussion Questions:
- What do you think using violent discipline tells a young person about him- or herself? What does it make him or her feel?
- For any of the role-plays, what other or additional forms of positive discipline could have been used?
- Is  there  any  connection  between  the  way  parents  were  raised  and  the  ways  they  raise  and discipline  or  punish  their  children?
- Which technique would be the easiest to use with your children? Why?
- Which technique would be the most difficult to use? Why? What could you do to make it easier to use?
- What obstacles might you face in using these positive parenting techniques?
- What are other ways to discipline children that do not involve hitting, slapping, or yelling and help you achieve your long-term goals for your child?
- What are ways in which we can recognize children for positive behavior?

| Your adolescent is spending a lot of time playing video games. Every day, you must fight with him to get him to turn the games off and do his homework. You worry that he is getting hooked on video games and will lose interest in everything else | You have a rule that your adolescent is to come right home every day after school. Even though you're not home at that time, they have always followed this rule. But one day, they are invited to a friend's house and accept. You just happen to come home early that day and discover that they aren't there. You are frantic with worry. They come home soon after. |

| Your adolescent comes home from school in a very bad mood. She doesn't want to talk to you and has an angry tone of voice.                                                                                                                           | You find a text message or written note to your adolescent from a student of the opposite sex at school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

- How does 'warmth,' such as showing physical affection (like hugging )or saying, 'I love you' to your child, help to reinforce good behavior?
- Do you think you will use any of these techniques in your own family?
- Who else in your home needs to be engaged in using positive parenting techniques?

## 13.  Read the Key Messages:

- 'Positive parenting techniques are not common in many homes. They can be difficult to learn and sometimes do not seem to work to quiet a child as quickly as hitting, slapping, or yelling.'
- 'However,  these  aggressive  techniques  create  fear  and  harm  a  child's  development.  They interfere with our long-term goals for our children. Positive parenting is not about being soft on children or letting them get away with naughty behavior. It is about using techniques that are both healthier for children and more effective in the long term.'
- 'Positive parenting means that we will be teaching the values we want a child to learn.'
- 'Parents must be patient, as the rewards of positive parenting can take time. Keep in mind that you are playing the long game; having a child that behaves today is nice, but even more important is having a child who grows up to be a healthy, intelligent, mature, and secure adult. You are raising your children for what they will become, so try to maintain the long-term perspective.'
- 'There are additional resources about positive parenting in the Participant Journal.'

## PART 3: WEEKLY COMMITMENT (5 MINUTES)

1. Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'Based on our discussion today, try some forms of positive parenting and positive discipline with your children. Discuss what you learned today with your spouse so you two can be on the same page and apply positive parenting even more effectively.'

## PART 4: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing their thoughts, questions, concerns, and experiences today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

<!-- image -->

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. State that today is the final session they will have together as a group. Say a few words about how much this group has meant to you and what you have learned from the participants.
3. Ask the group to share one thing that they learned during the last session and if they were able to do the weekly commitment from last week.
4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

Write some notes here about what you'd like to say about how much this group has meant to you and what you have learned from the participants.

## PART 2: CREATING FAMILY ACTION PLANS (45 MINUTES)

1. Explain to the group that in this activity, participants will have an opportunity to create an action plan of positive changes they would like to make and any plans they have for the future.
2. Tell the group: 'All of you have made a lot of personal growth and changes over these 11 sessions. As we discussed before, change is a gradual process. It is important to reflect on the changes we have made - where we have come from - and where we would like to be in the future. Even after this group has finished, you can continue to make positive changes that will improve your lives and relationships in ways that will benefit yourselves, your partners, your children, and your community.'
3. Ask everyone to close their eyes and think back to the earlier session in which they developed a family vision and refer to those plans:
- 'Remember the vision you imagined for your family and the long-term goals you identified. Remember the  things  you  hoped  to  have  achieved  in  five  years:  the  things  you  hoped  for yourself, your relationship with your partner, and your children. Think about the vision you had for  your  family.'
- 'What do you need to maintain the positive changes you have already made? What commitments are you making to your partner and your children? And based on the changes you have already made, what other changes do you need to make, or actions do you need to take, to achieve this vision?'
4. Ask everyone to open their eyes but keep this vision in their minds. Provide participants with four or five notecards and ask them to write down one action per card that they can do in the next six months to move them toward realizing this vision. (Optional: If you'd like to make this more artistic, you can bring in art supplies and create an art project to display their commitments to action instead.)

5. After everyone has finished, have them go around the circle and share at least one or two actions that they will adopt over the next six months. Also note that participants should also think of ways that the other group members can support them in making positive changes.
6. After everyone has had a chance to speak, open a discussion using the following Group Discussion Questions:
- What excites you about these actions you are putting in place to help realize your vision for your family?
- Do you have any fears or worries about moving forward with these changes?
- How can the participants in this group help each other to successfully implement and sustain the positive changes you have made?
7. Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the Key Message: ' All  of you should be proud of the positive changes you have made in your lives. Identifying our goals and the changes we need to make to achieve them is an important step in realizing the vision we have for ourselves and for our families. The things you have learned in this group and the people you have met here will support you in continuing to make positive changes that will benefit you, your partners, and your families.'

## PART 3: CELEBRATING OUR CHANGES (30 MINUTES)

1. Explain that in this activity, the participants will reflect on how the group sessions have benefited them, some of the positive changes they have made in their lives, and how these have impacted their relationships and the well-being of their families.
2. Tell the group: 'Over these 11 sessions, we have all learned from each other and grown in many ways. All of you have made a commitment to making positive changes in your lives and relationships, including working together for the betterment of your household. Change is a gradual process. It is important to take time to appreciate the changes we have made and to commit ourselves to continuing this process of positive change.'
3. Explain that each person will have the opportunity to share with the group what impact the group sessions have had on themselves, their family, and their relationships. They can talk about how the group has helped them to grow as a person, to work better together, and to make changes in their family.
4. Ask who would like to volunteer to go first. Explain that each person will have as much time as they need to share. They can decide what they would like to share with the group, but it can include:
- What personal changes have you made in your life?
- How has your family and community been involved in this change?
- What rewards or benefits have you seen from these changes?
- What changes do you plan to make in the future to further support your partner's, your children's, and your household's development?
- What did you enjoy about this group?
5. Ask the first person who wants to share to come to the front and stand up to speak. When he has finished, present him with his certificate of completion.
6. Ask for another volunteer and continue until everyone has had time to do so and has received his certificate of completion.

7. After everyone has shared their stories, ask if any of the participants would like to provide feedback to those who have shared their stories. These should be words of encouragement and support.
8. After any feedback has been provided, thank everyone for sharing and congratulate everyone on the important changes and steps they have made in their lives. Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas.
9. Close  the  activity  by  sharing  the Key  Message: 'This  is  only  the  beginning  of  the  process  of change. All of us can commit to be involved, caring, and supportive partners who have equitable relationships and share power and decision-making. When men and women work together side by side, they can better ensure the well-being of their household and achieve the common goals they have for the family. By working together, men and women can achieve happy, successful, and economically productive families. This change can be sustained and expanded through the support and commitment of all of those here today. I encourage all of you to continue to support each other, and seek support from your family and community, in making positive changes.'

## PART 4:

## POST-TEST (20 MINUTES)

1. Hand out the post-test survey and have participants take time to complete it.
2. Collect the completed post-test surveys.

## PART 5: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank participants again for their participation in the group over the past several weeks. Encourage them to continue learning, listening, and practicing their new skills.
2. Ask  participants,  if  they  have  not  already,  to  exchange  contact  information  so  that  they  can continue communicating with each other now that the group has been completed. Suggest they set up a WhatsApp group so they can continue the conversation online.
3. Close the group with one final check-out.

Facilitator Note: The ceremony for participants can also be a separate meeting in which you invite families and community members.

## APPENDIX A: SAMPLE ENERGIZERS AND ICEBREAKERS

## Ha, Ha

Begin  by  having  all  the  players  sit  in  a  circle.  Tell all  the  players  they  have  to  remain  as  solemn  and serious as they can throughout the game. Pick one player  to  start  the  game  by  saying  'Ha'  once.  The player standing next to him says the word 'Ha' twice. Following  this  pattern,  the  third  player  says  'Ha' three times. As the game progresses, eliminate any players who laugh or make noise when it is not their turn. The player who avoids laughing throughout the game  wins.

## Get in Motion

Ask group members to stand. Ask them to shake their right arm, then their left arm, then their right leg, and then their left leg. Now, tell participants that you will count to ten while they shake each limb. They will shake their right arm ten times, then their left arm ten times, followed by their right leg ten times, and their left leg ten times - you can count to ten out loud for  each  limb.  As  soon  as  participants  have  shaken each limb ten times, go through the cycle again, but only count to nine. Proceed, counting to eight, then seven, then six, then five, and so on until participants only  shake  each  limb  once.  To  make  the  energizer more exciting, you can count faster and faster as you go.

## The Stomp

Ask everyone to stand in a circle. Teach them a threecount stomp pattern and do it together (for example: stomp-stomp-clap, stomp-stomp-clap). Then, teach them a four-count pattern (like stomp-stomp-stompclap, stomp-stomp-stomp-clap).

Divide  the  participants  into  two  groups.  Have  one group do the first pattern and the second group do the  second  pattern.  If  there  is  more  time,  you  can have  individuals  create  their  own  patterns  for  the group  to  imitate.

## The Spaghetti

Have  the  group  form  a  tight  circle  with  everyone sticking their hands into the center. Instruct everyone to use one hand to grab the hand of another person. Then, using the other hand, they should each grab the hand of someone different. Tell participants that the object of the game is to get untangled without letting go; by climbing, crawling, and  wriggling around, participants can create one large open circle or,  sometimes,  two  unconnected  ones.  If  they  are totally stuck, you can tell them they can choose to undo one link and then reconnect once that person has turned around, seeing if that works. (Note: This energizer  is  fun  and  creates  a  nice  physical  bond between  participants.  It  also  subtly  communicates ideas of working together to accomplish a task.)

## The Shrinking Iceberg

Put a blanket or several sheets of newspaper on the floor. Ask the group to stand on it. Then, explain that this is an iceberg that is melting away, reducing in size by half every month. Their object is to see how long they can all stay on it. Ask them to get off and fold the blanket in half or remove half the paper. Repeat, each time reducing the area by half, and see how they can find ways to support each other to allow everyone to stay on.

## APPENDIX B: ADDITIONAL MINDFULNESS ACTIVITIES

## Mindfulness Activity: Body Scan

## No materials required

Tell  the  participants  that  you  will  be  leading  them through  a  mindfulness  activity  called  Body  Scan. During  this  activity,  you  will  be  having  them  close their  eyes  or  soften  their  gaze  and  walking  them through an activity in which they will be able to take some time and pay attention to what their body is feeling.  Then,  read  the  script:

Begin by making yourself comfortable. Sit in a chair and  allow  your  back  to  be  straight,  but  not  stiff, with your feet on the ground. You could also do this practice standing or if you prefer, you can lie down and have your head supported. Your hands could be resting gently in your lap or at your side. Allow your eyes to close, or to remain open with a soft gaze.

Take  several  long,  slow,  deep  breaths.  Breathing  in fully  and  exhaling  slowly.  Breathe  in  through  your nose and out through your nose or mouth. Feel your stomach expand on an inhale and relax and let go as you  exhale.

Begin to let go of noises around you. Begin to shift your attention from outside to inside yourself. If you are distracted by sounds in the room, simply notice this and bring your focus back to your breathing.

Now slowly bring your attention down to your feet. Begin observing sensations in your feet. You might want  to  wiggle  your  toes  a  little,  feeling  your  toes against  your  socks  or  shoes.  Just  notice,  without judgment.  You  might  imagine  sending  your  breath down to your feet, as if the breath is traveling through the nose to the lungs and through the abdomen all the way down to your feet. And then back up again out  through  your  nose  and  lungs.  Perhaps  you don't feel anything at all. That is fine, too. Just allow yourself to feel the sensation of not feeling anything.

When  you  are  ready,  allow  your  feet  to  dissolve in  your  mind's  eye  and  move  your  attention  up  to your ankles, calves, knees and thighs. Observe the sensations  you  are  experiencing  throughout  your legs. Breathe into and breathe out of the legs. If your mind begins to wander during this exercise, gently notice  this  without  judgment  and  bring  your  mind back to noticing the sensations in your legs. If you notice any discomfort, pain or stiffness, don't judge this. Just simply notice it. Observe how all sensations rise and fall, shift and change moment to moment.

Notice how no sensation is permanent. Just observe and allow the sensations to be in the moment, just as they are. Breathe into and out from the legs.

Then on the next out breath, allow the legs to dissolve in  your  mind.  And  move  to  the  sensations  in  your lower back and pelvis. Softening and releasing as you breathe in and out. Slowly move your attention up to  your  mid  back  and  upper  back.  Become  curious about the sensations here. You may become aware of  sensations in the muscle, temperature or points of contact with furniture.…With each outbreath, you may let go of tension you are carrying. And then very gently shift your focus to your stomach and all the internal organs here. Perhaps you notice the feeling of clothing, the process of digestion or the belly rising or  falling  with  each  breath.  If  you  notice  opinions arising  about  these  areas,  gently  let  these  go  and return  to  noticing  sensations.  As  you  continue  to breathe, bring your awareness to the chest and heart region and just notice your heartbeat. Observe how the chest rises during the inhale and how the chest falls during the exhale. Let go of any judgments that may arise. On the next outbreath, shift the focus to your  hands  and  fingertips.  See  if  you  can  channel your breathing into and out of this area as if you are breathing into and out from your hands. If your mind wanders,  gently  bring  it  back  to  the  sensations  in your  hands.

And then, on the next outbreath, shift the focus and bring  your  awareness  up  into  your  arms.  Observe the  sensations  or  lack  of  sensations  that  may  be occurring  there.  You  might  notice  some  difference between the left arm and the right arm - no need to judge this. As you exhale, you may experience the arm soften and release tensions. Continue to breathe and shift focus to the neck, shoulder and throat region. This is an area where we often have tension. Be with the sensations here. It could be tightness, rigidity or holding. You may notice the shoulders moving along with the breath. Let go of any thoughts or stories you are telling about this area. As you breathe, you may feel tension rolling off your shoulders.

On the next out breath, shift your focus and direct your attention to the scalp, head and face. Observe all  of  the  sensations  occurring  there.  Notice  the movement of the air as you breathe into or out of the nostrils or mouth. As you exhale, you might notice the softening of any tension you may be holding.

And now, let your attention to expand out to include the entire body as a whole. Bring into your awareness the  top  of  your  head  down  to  the  bottom  of  your toes.  Feel  the  gentle  rhythm  of  the  breath  as  it moves through the body. As you come to the end of this practice, take a full, deep breath, taking in all the energy of this practice. Exhale fully. And when you are ready, open your eyes and return your attention to the present moment.

As you become fully alert and awake, consider setting the intention that this practice of building awareness will benefit everyone you come in contact with today.

## Mindfulness Activity: Beats Listening Game

## No materials required

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called the Beats Listening  Game.  During  this  exercise,  you'll  be concentrating  on  the  sounds  you'll  make  as  a group.
2. Bring the participants into a circle formation.
3. Have one person make a sound, which can be a beat or a rhythm ('boom,' 'swish,' 'bang,' 'uhh,' etc.).
4. Have the next person repeat the sound and add a beat of their own.
5. Continue  around  the  group,  with  each  person adding  a  sound  after  repeating  the  previous sounds.

## Mindfulness Activity: Active Listening

## Materials required: Phone/speakers and a song/ music

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through  a  mindfulness  activity called Active Listening. During  this exercise, they will be concentrating  fully  on  one  song.
2. Pick a song and have it ready to play on a phone or speakers.
3. Ask the participants to close their eyes and listen closely to the music.
4. Explain that they should follow the lyrics, notice the different instruments, or take in the song as a whole experience. If they have heard the song before,  they  should  listen  for  something  they haven't  ever  noticed  before:  What  are  the  new sounds and lyrics that you are hearing? What are they trying to tell you?
5. Play the music.

## Mindfulness Activity: Senses

## Materials required: a candy for each participant

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through  a  mindfulness  activity  called  Senses. During this activity, you will be giving them a raisin (or other candy) and guiding them through their senses while giving the object all their attention.
2. Give the participants a raisin (or other candy)
3. Read the script:

Holding: First, take a raisin and hold it in the palm of your hand or between your finger and thumb.

[(If  in  a  wrapper)  Hearing:  Unwrap  the  candy  and listen  very  carefully  to  the  sounds  it  makes  as  you take it off. Try to block out all of the other sounds you may be hearing in the room.]

Seeing: Take  time  to  really  focus  on  it;  gaze  at  the raisin  with  care  and  full  attention-imagine  that you've  just  dropped  in  from  Mars  and  have  never seen an object like this before in your life. Let your eyes explore every part of it, examining the highlights where the light shines, the darker hollows, the folds and ridges, and any asymmetries or unique features.

Touching: Turn the raisin over between your fingers, exploring its  texture.  Maybe  do  this  with  your  eyes closed if that enhances your sense of touch.

Smelling :  Hold  the  raisin  beneath  your  nose.  With each inhalation, take in any smell, aroma, or fragrance that  may  arise.  As  you  do  this,  notice  anything interesting that may be happening in your mouth or stomach.

Placing: Now slowly bring the raisin up to your lips, noticing how your hand and arm know exactly how and  where  to  position  it.  Gently  place  the  raisin in  your  mouth;  without  chewing,  noticing  how  it gets into your mouth in the first place. Spend a few moments focusing on the sensations of having it in your  mouth,  exploring  it  with  your  tongue.

Tasting: When you are ready, prepare to chew the raisin,  noticing  how  and  where  it  needs  to  be  for chewing.  Then,  very  consciously,  take  one  or  two bites into it and notice what happens in the aftermath, experiencing any waves of taste that emanate from it as you continue chewing. Without swallowing yet, notice  the  bare  sensations  of  taste  and  texture  in your mouth and how these may change over time, moment  by  moment.  Also  pay  attention  to  any changes in the object itself.

Swallowing: When  you  feel  ready  to  swallow  the raisin, see  if you  can  first  detect  the  intention to  swallow  as  it  comes  up,  so  that  even  this  is experienced consciously before you actually swallow the raisin.

Following: Finally,  see  if  you  can  feel  what  is  left of  the  raisin  moving  down  into  your  stomach,  and sense how your body as a whole is feeling after you have  completed  this  exercise.

## APPENDIX C: FACILITATING MIXED-GENDER GROUPS

## Participant Dynamics

In  this  adaptation,  women  are  not  involved  as participants.  However,  depending  on  the  context, a  future  iteration  of  this  curriculum  could  involve a  mixed  group  that  includes  women  spouses  as well  -  particularly  in  Sessions  3,  6,  10,  11,  and  12. These mixed sessions would be designed to engage participants  in  critical  reflection  and  to  promote dialogue  between  men  and  women  and  between parents  and  their  children.  Some  activities  might require men and women to participate in separate group discussions to make sure that both men and women  feel  comfortable  enough  to  express  their ideas and opinions, particularly on issues that may be sensitive to discuss in front of their partner. Through these activities, men and women may begin to feel more comfortable communicating with each other.

In  mixed  sessions,  you  may  see  a  range  of  power dynamics being exercised, especially by men, including many of those we are trying to positively change through the curriculum! Here are a few tips may  be  helpful:

- Be  aware  of  family  and  gendered  power  dynamics. The fathers in the group may be used to speaking on behalf of their partners and children, but in our groups, we want to make sure everyone can speak freely.  If  fathers  or  boys  are  trying  to  speak  on behalf of women and girls, or interrupting them, gently thank them for their enthusiasm but say that in the group we want to make sure everyone can share their own stories. You can even refer back  to  the  group  agreement  about  making  'I' statements - that every participant should speak from  their  own  knowledge  and  experience  and not speak on behalf of others. As the facilitator, you will need to demonstrate and model paying attention to women and girls when they speak as well. Whenever they are talking, look at them and listen carefully to what they are saying. If you are

looking  away  or  not  fully  paying  attention,  that sends  a  signal  to  men  and  boys  that  women's voices are less important.

- Pay  particular  attention  to  interruptions  and side  conversations. In  general,  men  and  boys are far more likely to interrupt women and girls than the other way around. When men and boys interrupt,  step  in,  ask  them  to  please  wait,  and then  turn  your  attention  back  to  the  original person speaking. This also applies when men and boys interrupt other men and boys. Men and boys are often more likely to have side conversations or take phone calls when someone else is speaking. When that happens, pause the conversation and ask those being disruptive to stop and rejoin the group. You can also remind them about the group agreement that only one person speaks at a time.
- Depending on who is in the room, participants may be less willing to share openly. For instance, women may be less comfortable speaking freely in  front  of  their  spouse,  and  children  may  be less comfortable speaking freely in front of one or both of their parents. When these groups are together,  don't  pressure  individuals  to  share, but  you  can  give  them  additional  time  to  think about their answers to the questions or to write down and  reflect  on  their  answers  without  the expectation  that  those  answers  will  be  shared. Feel  free  to  modify  your  approach  in  those activities accordingly based on how you see the participants responding. Another way to address this  is,  where  appropriate,  to  break  participants into family groups to discuss.  Women  and children may be less comfortable speaking about their  spouse  or  father  in  the  large  group  but may be able to speak openly when they are just speaking with family members or even in a small group  with  one  other  family  group.

## Facilitator Dynamics

The  mixed  sessions  in  the  curriculum  would  need to be  facilitated by two  facilitators, ideally  one male  and  one  female.  While  this  always  depends on  the  availability  and  skills  of  facilitators  in  your community,  some  of  the  sessions  ask  to  separate men and women and recommend that these groups be facilitated by just a male facilitator (for the group of men) or just a female facilitator (for the group of women). This allows a bit more comfort during those sensitive conversations.

When  facilitating  with  one  female  facilitator  and one  male  facilitator,  it  is  important  to  make  sure that facilitators are modeling gender-equitable relationships.  That  means  both  are  demonstrating the types of communication and sharing of decisionmaking that you are encouraging the participants to undertake.  Some  items  to  be  careful  of  include:

- Ensure  facilitators  are  dividing  the  work  evenly. That means that one facilitator is not conducting all the sessions or doing most of the work. Activities should be divided evenly by facilitators (either by switching every other activity or switching every session).
- Be careful that female facilitators are not the ones always taking notes or that male facilitators are not

the  ones  always  leading  the  group  discussions. This  can  inadvertently  send  the  impression  that male  facilitators  are  more  valuable  than  their female colleagues. Be sure to share these roles.

- Remember that the reverse is also true. If a female facilitator is leading all the discussions and a male facilitator  is  sitting  back  and  not  participating, it  can  give  the  impression  that  he  is  not  in agreement and is less invested in the group. The facilitator not leading should remain attentive and engaged with the group at all times, not looking off  into  space  or  checking their phone.
- Ensure facilitators are comfortable with one another and have a good working relationship and communication.
- Make  sure  facilitators  don't  interrupt  or  cut  one another off - again, modeling the type of behavior you wish to see in participants is very important.
- Emphasize  that  facilitators  should  practice  with one another before the session and divide up roles and activities  well  in  advance.  If  you  are  unsure about whether your facilitation team is modeling gender-equitable relationships, have them practice in front of a colleague or a supervisor and get  feedback  from  others.

## PARTICIPANT JOURNAL

## Journal Activity 4.1: What Do I Do When I Am Angry?

Think of times recently in which you felt angry. What happened? Describe this briefly in one or two sentences.

After thinking about these scenarios, try to remember what you were thinking about and what you felt. List some of these feelings.

When we feel angry, we often resort to violence. This might happen even before we realize it as a reaction that for some people is instant and manifests as yelling and throwing things across the room or hitting something or someone. In other times, we may get depressed, isolate ourselves, or remain silent. Now that you're rethinking the scenario in which you were angry, how did that anger manifest? How did you behave? Write a sentence or a few words about your actions.

## Journal Resource Page 8.1: Strategies to Challenge Honor-Based Violence

## Taking a Positive and Personal Approach

- Talk with friends and family about the alternatives to  honor-based  violence  you  use  or  would  use, including trusting and empowering your wife and children.
- Talk with friends and family about how you would never hurt or kill (or ask anyone else to hurt or kill) a relative for any reason, including honor, and why.
- Publicly embrace others who have been negatively affected by or rejected due to honorbased violence.

## Proactively Building a Movement

- Cultivate  allies  among  your  friends  and  family who are also against honor-based violence so you can work together when and if needed to prevent others from using it. Don't wait until something is already happening to try and find allies. Know who will support you (socially, economically, politically, and  otherwise)  and  with  whom  you  can  stand together to publicly reject honor-based violence.
- Offer honorable alternatives to honor-based violence  that  can  accomplish  the  same  things.
- Seek  out  and  cultivate  high-status  community leaders who also reject honor-based violence. At

key times, you can ask them to add their voice to help convince others and to act as a mediator to prevent  violence.

## Withdrawing Participation

- Refuse to participate in honor-based discussions when they turn toward using violence and explain why to those participating.
- Reject others who try to impose what you perceive as excessive honor-based norms upon you, your family, your friends, and your community.

## Openly Challenging Honor-Based Violence

- Speak up about your opposition to honor-based violence  with  friends  and  family,  such  as  when a  story  about  it  is  in  the  news  or  it  happens  to someone  you  know.  You  could  speak  about  it with a group of people or one on one depending on your comfort level. Don't wait until the issue is  directly  affecting your family. Speak up before it  does!
- Remain  in  a  discussion  about  honor  or  honorbased violence  when  the  dialogue  turns  toward using  violence,  but  express  disagreement  with those  approaches.

## Journal Resource Page 9.1: Communicating as a Family

## Suggestions for Young Men

- Talk for yourself. Don't let others talk for you. No one will express your thoughts, feelings, or ideas as well as you.
- Work on controlling your body language. Rolling eyes, heavy sighing, and other emotional reactions take your parents' attention away from what  you  are  saying.
- If  upset, take time to cool down before trying to talk. We don't talk, think, or hear clearly when we are upset.
- Think about what it would be like to be your parent. This won't change what you want, but it helps you understand your parent's reactions. That can help you calm down and speak more clearly.

## Suggestions for Parents

- Listen to your teen before responding. Let them know you heard what they said, consider it, and then  respond.
- Remember what it was like when you were their age. This can help you understand their situation without setting aside your job as their parent.
- Know that the best communication can happen on the spur of the moment, when you are on your way  somewhere or  grabbing  a  bite  to  eat.  Take advantage of those times together and talk.
- Remember that young people are in the midst of figuring out what they want and learning how to manage their newly intense emotions. They need time  and  experience  to  accomplish  these  tasks, and so set your expectations appropriately.
- Let your teen know about the mistakes you have made. Just because you did something as a teen does not give them license to do the same thing.
- Remember you had to learn many things by doing them.
- Put aside the teacher role once in a while. Listen to their opinion and ideas, recognizing that they aren't going to act on every idea.

## Suggestions for Both

- Time your conversations. Don't wait until you are upset; don't try to talk when you are busy, tired, or hungry or when your parents/children are busy, tired, or hungry.
- Begin  your  statements  with  the  word  'I,'  not 'you': for example, 'I feel hurt when you talk to me like that' rather than 'You never talk to me like I  am  human.'
- Ask why they said something or made a decision rather than assuming why. Then, respond based on that explanation.
- Pay  attention  to  your  reaction  inside.  If  you're upset, take time to cool down. We don't talk or hear  very  well  when  we  are  upset.
- Show respect for each other's uniqueness. Once in  a  while,  put  aside  the  fact  that  they  are  your parent/child and listen like they are someone else.
- Say you are sorry when you have done something wrong.
- Admit it when the other person is or may be right or when they may have a better idea.
- Show  your  appreciation  for  each  other.  Notice what  each  is  doing  right.
- Be  aware  of  your  tone  of  voice  and  leave  the attitude  outside.  If  you  can't,  take  time  to  cool down  before  beginning  the  conversation.
- Do it the other person's way once in a while.

## Journal Resource Page 10.2: Positive Parenting Techniques

The type of discipline  a  parent  uses  influences  the type of adult that a young man or woman becomes. What type  of  discipline  do  you  use?  What  type  of person do you want your child to be? The following are a few positive parenting techniques that you can use with your child:

- Be firm. Clearly and firmly state, or even demand, that the child do what needs to be done. Speak in a tone that lets your child know that you mean what you say and that you expect the child to do as they are told. Being firm doesn't mean yelling, nagging,  threatening,  reasoning,  or  taking  away privileges. Keep suggestions to a minimum, and always speak kindly, even when speaking firmly.
- Manage behavior. Talk with them calmly to learn what  caused  a  disagreement.  Then,  talk  about ways  to  deal  with  it.  Come  to  a  solution  that's agreeable to both of you. This helps children learn to  be  responsible for their behavior.
- Stay  in  control. Act  before  the  situation  gets out of control - before you get angry and overly frustrated and before the child's behavior becomes unreasonable.
- Praise. Give more attention (and praise) for good behavior  and  less  for  bad  behavior.  Don't  make punishment  a  reward.  Let  them  know  that  you appreciate a good  attitude and cooperation. Young  people  respond  positively to genuine respect  and  praise.
- Prevent  disputes. Look  for  ways  to  head  off a dispute before it starts by thinking  about your  child's  habits  and  needs  and  what  has caused conflict in the past. For instance, if your adolescent becomes grumpy and argumentative when hungry, make sure they always have plenty to  eat,  even  offering  food  unprompted  because you know they need to eat. If there is a particular issue or thing that sets them off, look for ways to avoid it or to prepare them to deal with it when it happens.
- Cool  them  down. When  young people are misbehaving, tell them that they are misbehaving and suggest another activity or just get them to stop what they should not be doing. Then, give them some time and space before bringing it up

to  discuss  why  it  was  a  problem  and  what  the alternatives are.

- Cool yourself down. If  you  find  yourself  getting angry and wanting to shout or use violence, and it  is  safe  to  do  so,  sometimes  the  best  solution can be to leave the room, go outside, or just take a  minute  to  cool  down  before  dealing  with  the child's misbehavior. Even just a minute or two can help you regain your composure and think of the best way to address a situation.

## A Note on Children's Anger

From Positive Discipline in Everyday Parenting by Joan E. Durant,  Ph.D.,  Save  the  Children,  2016.

One of the major tasks of childhood is learning how to manage and express emotions. This is a difficult task  because  emotions  can  sometimes  keep  us from  thinking  clearly.  Emotions  can  lead  us  to  act impulsively, saying things we wouldn't otherwise say or  doing  things  we  wouldn't  otherwise  do.

For a child to understand emotions and to be able to manage them and express them in a positive way is a huge task.

Sometimes  children's  emotions  overwhelm  them. Just  as  they  had  tantrums  in  the  early  years,  they might  have  angry  outbursts  in  the  middle  years. Or they might simply be silent, unable, or afraid to express  how  they  feel.

At  these  times,  they  need  to  know  that  they  are safe and loved. It's not really possible to have a calm conversation with your child when he is very angry. The best thing to do is to simply stay nearby, letting your  child  know  through  your  actions  that  you  are there if she needs you.

Once  the  storm  has  passed,  you  can  talk  about the issue and, by staying calm, you can show your child how to express feelings in a positive way. You can also show her ways of finding solutions to the problem  that  led  to  the  outburst.

Remember that emotional storms do pass. And each one provides an opportunity to be a role model for your  child.

## Journal Resource Page 10.3: Information About Young Teens

## Developmental Milestones

This is a time of many physical, mental, emotional, and social changes. …They might be worried about these changes and how they are looked at by others. This also will be a time when your teen might face peer pressure to use alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs,  and  to  have  sex.  Other  challenges  can  be eating disorders, depression, and family problems. At this age, teens make more of their own choices about friends, sports, studying, and school. They become more  independent,  with  their  own  personality  and interests, although parents are still very important.

## Emotional/Social Changes

Children in this age group might:

- Show  more  concern  about  body  image,  looks, and  clothes.
- Focus  on  themselves; going back and forth between high expectations and lack of confidence.
- Experience more moodiness.
- Show  more  interest  in  and  influence  by  peer group.
- Express less affection toward parents; sometimes might seem rude or short-tempered.
- Feel stress from more challenging school work.
- Develop eating problems.
- Feel  a  lot  of  sadness  or  depression,  which  can lead to poor grades at school, alcohol or drug use, unsafe sex, and other problems.

## Thinking and Learning

Children in this age group might:

- Have more ability for complex thought.
- Be better able to express feelings through talking.
- Develop a stronger sense of right and wrong.

## Healthy Bodies

- Encourage your teen to be physically active. She might join a team sport or take up an individual sport.  Helping  with  household  tasks  such  [as helping in the garden or washing the car also will keep  your  teen  active.]
- Meal  time  is  very  important  for  families.  Eating together helps teens make better choices about the foods they eat, promotes healthy weight, and gives your family members time to talk with each other.
- Keep television sets out of your teen's bedroom. Set limits for screen time, including cell phones, computers, video games, and other devices, and develop a family media plan.
