## INTRODUCTION

## The International Men and Gender Equality Survey

## WHERE ARE MEN ON GENDER EQUALITY?

More  than  25  years  since  the  landmark  World  Conference  on Women in Beĳing and the International Conference on Population and  Development  in  Cairo,  the  world  is  further  from  achieving gender  equality  than  it  should  be.  Global  data  tracking  progress on Sustainable Development Goal 5 show us that only 57 percent of  women  report  making  their  own  decisions  about  sexual  and reproductive health and rights, with only three of every four women able to say no to sex - an essential dimension of bodily autonomy and deciding about their own health care. 1  Contraceptive methods used  by  men  or  that  require  their  cooperation  make  up  only  25 percent of global contraceptive use, a rate virtually unchanged in the past few decades. 2

Globally, women perform three to ten times as much unpaid care and domestic work 3  as men. 4  They also make up 70 percent of the global paid care workforce but represent only 25 percent of senior roles in that system 5 . At the current rate of change, the world is at least  91  years  away  from  achieving  equality  in  unpaid  care  work between men and women, 6  as the traditional gendered division of tasks between paid work and reproductive labor persists. Women's political  participation  -  a  key  indicator  of  women's  full  equality  has  also  stalled.  As  of  March  2022,  women  constituted  only  26 percent of parliamentarians globally. 7  Additionally, the World Health Organization estimates that between 24 and 30 percent of women have  experienced  some  form  of  violence  perpetrated  by  a  man, most often a male partner, with little evidence of decline in recent decades. 8  Data from 142 studies in 44 countries point to an alarming increase in men's violence against women during COVID-19. 9

Behind all of these trends is the ongoing inequitable power, privilege, and  gender  norms  related  to  men  and  masculinities.  Indeed, women's  economic,  social,  and  political  inequality  is  inequality relative to men, whether it be men who hold political and economic power or men in their households and intimate lives. As such, the need  for  policies  to  support  changing  masculinities  and  men's attitudes and behaviors is as urgent as ever. Furthermore, evidence shows that men and boys' lives are also shaped by the gendered violence they experience in their homes, schools, communities, and male peer groups. And numerous studies have affirmed how men's health and well-being are negatively affected by restrictive norms related to masculinity. 10

In the past two years of COVID-19 and the resulting global economic decline, the progress toward full equality for women and girls has been sharply set back. 11  COVID-19 lockdowns have also thrown care inequalities into stark relief. Women have continued to do the lion's share of care work around the world under the pandemic, and the increase in unpaid care work - combined with a surge in domestic violence,  as  well  as  job  losses  and  economic  stress  -  has  meant added strain on mental health, particularly among women. 12

In this context, where progress has stalled or even reversed, it is imperative to ask: Where are men on gender equality? What are their  attitudes  and  day-to-day lived experiences? Are men buying into or resisting the idea of gender equality? How are these issues

similar or different by country and cultural setting? How are men's own  lives  affected  by  salient  norms  related  to  masculinities  and other factors that shape their lived experiences? And importantly, how can the evidence that answers these questions be used to drive  progress  toward  more  equitable,  caring,  and  nonviolent versions of manhood for the benefit of all? These are questions that the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) global data set can begin to answer.

## WHAT IS IMAGES, AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?

Led and created by Equimundo (previously Promundo-US, in partnership with Instituto Promundo  in Brazil) and the International Center for Research on Women, IMAGES is one of the most comprehensive studies ever to explore men's practices and attitudes related to gender equality alongside women's. Using a  wide  variety  of  measures,  IMAGES  questionnaires  investigate gender-based violence, health and health-related practices, household division of labor, men's participation in caregiving and as fathers, men's and women's attitudes about gender and genderrelated  policies,  transactional  sex,  men's  reports  of  criminal behavior,  and  quality  of  life.  Details  on  the  IMAGES  surveys  are presented in Appendix A.

The  IMAGES  questionnaire  incorporates  items  from  existing survey instruments on gender, quality of life, childhood antecedents of  violence  (including  observing  gender-based  violence),  health, sexuality, family gender dynamics, and fatherhood, as well as new items created specifically for the survey. It builds on the Gender Equality  and  Quality  of  Life  Survey  (GEQ  Survey)  first  fielded  in Norway, as well as widely used instruments such as the Gender Equitable  Men  (GEM)  Scale  and  standardized  questions  from the  multicountry  surveys  on  violence  against  women  developed in  partnership  with  the  World  Health  Organization.  Wherever quantitative  data  collection  and  analysis  have  occurred  using the  IMAGES  survey,  research  partners  also  have  conducted

## THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF IMAGES IS TO BUILD UNDERSTANDING OF MEN'S AND WOMEN'S PRACTICES AND ATTITUDES RELATED TO GENDER EQUALITY IN ORDER TO INFORM, DRIVE, AND MONITOR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE GENDER EQUALITY, PARTICULARLY AT THE GOVERNMENT POLICY LEVEL.

complementary qualitative studies in the same settings, seeking to document in depth the lived realities of gender inequalities, notions of  masculinity  and  femininity,  and  participants'  perspectives  on efforts to promote gender equality. IMAGES data make it possible to:

-  Explore men's experience on topics usually explored with women only;
-  Triangulate results across men's and women's experiences;
-  Generate  a  baseline  on  gendered  attitudes  and  practices  in  a setting,  such  that  progress  toward  the  equality  agenda  can  be contrasted with it in the future; and
-  Contribute to a global effort to improve the evidence base on men and masculinities and on gender equality.

It is important to acknowledge that IMAGES is designed to focus on gender dynamics primarily in the households of heterosexualidentifying  adult  partners.  The  questionnaire  asks  respondents about  their  sexual  orientation  and  sexual  practices,  including current or ever cohabitation with a same-sex partner and if they are  heterosexual.  Given  the  high  prevalence  of  homophobic policies, laws, and social norms in the countries surveyed, it seems

likely  that  the  percentage  reporting  a  sexual  orientation  other than heterosexual has been lower than is actually the case. Several IMAGES studies have measured homophobic attitudes, but these  modules  have  not  been  fielded  in  every  study  location  due to  government  restrictions,  safety  risks  to  respondents  or  data collectors, and/or advice from local LGBTQIA+ and women's rights advocates that these topics were too culturally sensitive or politically dangerous to ask. In all locations, researchers have encountered the challenge of seeking to make diverse sexual orientations visible and honored, while also recognizing the unintended harm that may accrue  from  widely  publicizing  how  commonplace  homophobic attitudes are.  IMAGES  has  not  yet  included  questions  about nonbinary gender identity. Future IMAGES surveys should continue to explore sexual orientation and begin to explore gender identity, going deeper in these much-neglected areas in ways that adhere to the needs and priorities of local LGBTQIA+ movement organizing.

IMAGES findings have been widely disseminated to inform policy and  programming  across  multiple  sectors.  At  the  national  level, IMAGES  data  have  informed  policy  and  action  in  a  variety  of ways, including inspiring men's health initiatives in Brazil, starting discussions  with  the  Ministry  of  Health  in  Chile  around  engaging men  in childbirth, promoting  new  and  progressive sexuality education  policies  in  Croatia,  and  initiating  sexual  and  genderbased  violence  prevention  activities  with  men  in  Tanzania  and the  eastern  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo.  At  the  global level,  IMAGES  data  were  the  foundation  for  creating  the  global MenCare campaign, a 50-plus-country initiative to promote men's involvement as equitable, nonviolent caregivers. IMAGES data have also  been  consistently  featured  in  State  of  the  World's  Fathers,  a biennial  global  report  on  men's  participation  in  caregiving  (see www.stateoftheworldsfathers.org). IMAGES studies in many settings have been carried out by, and often funded in part by, the United Nations Population Fund, as well as UN Women. IMAGES also informed the multicountry Partners for Prevention (P4P) studies on men's violence against women carried out in the Asia-Pacific region by multiple United Nations agencies.

The infographics here make use of a sample of 67,202 respondents across 32 countries. Of these respondents, 50,373 are male (from 32 countries) and 16,829 are female (from 21 countries), all of whom were  interviewed  face  to  face. 13   For  12  studies,  only  men's  data were collected and/or made available for the present analysis. The decision to include men alone in some locations reflected funding priorities or other local considerations. This was the least preferred option  and  relatively  rare  overall,  as  most  studies  followed  the practice of asking similar questions of women and men. A focus on men and masculinities,  including  in  sample  construction,  reflects the intended 'value-add' of IMAGES within a prior body of evidence in which studies of violence, health, and family life generally included fewer questions for men, fewer men, or a subset of men who were sampled because of their relationships to women (i.e., husbands). IMAGES has addressed this limitation directly by focusing on men.

Figures  2  and  3  presents  the  sample  size  (and  proportion  of  the global sample) for each study, organized by region. Figure 3 presents how the samples of men and women are distributed by age (18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 49, and 50-plus), education (using global standard categories), and employment status at the time of the survey. Note that  the  totals  may  on  occasion  not  sum  to  100  percent  because of rounding. Overall, the age distributions of men and women are comparable, with slightly fewer women sampled in the 18 to 24 and 35 to 49 age categories and a few more women in the oldest age group (50-plus) compared to men. With regard to education, men are more concentrated in the primary and lower/upper secondary categories,  while  women  are  more  concentrated  in  the  below primary  and  postsecondary  categories.  As  for  employment,  the sample  shows  nearly  three-quarters  (73  percent)  of  men  were currently employed at the time of the survey, while the opposite was true for women, with nearly three-quarters not currently employed (71 percent).

Samples were chosen to be representative of the specific geographic areas where the surveys were carried out and generally represented at least two major urban areas. Budgetary limitations meant  that  only  some,  not  all,  IMAGES  studies  achieved  national representativeness in the manner of larger national initiatives, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys. Nonetheless, all samples followed best practice  household  sampling  approaches,  with samples drawn by national statistical bureaus, local census listings, and nationally recognized research firms or organizations.

When  displaying  comparisons  among  subsets  of  respondents (whether  by  sex,  country,  region, 14   or  other  characteristics),  only findings  that  are  statistically  significant  at  the  p  &lt;  .05  level  are included.

It is important to be cautious when making longitudinal comparisons given  that  data  was  collected  over  14  years  in  different  settings. Nevertheless,  IMAGES  continues  to  provide  a  unique  snapshot into a global picture of gendered attitudes and behaviors. While 32 countries were harmonized in the first round, efforts in the future will be to harmonize and analyze IMAGES data collected from other countries.

## HEADLINE 1

## Many children grow up seeing their fathers or other men dominate household decision-making.

Many men and women in IMAGES locations grew up witnessing unequal power in decision-making between  men and women. IMAGES  surveys asked respondents to reflect on  their  childhood  homes  and  to  share  who  in  their  childhood had the final say on the following decisions: spending on food and clothing,  large  investments  (house,  car,  and  large  appliances), children's education, whether your partner/you may work outside the home, and how you spend your free time. Detailed information on  all  of  the  questions  asked  in  each  country  can  be  found  in country  reports  here.  The  present  analysis  explores  decisionmaking on large investments and children's education. The frequency with which respondents recall a highly unequal dynamic in  their  childhood homes is concerning worldwide, particularly in the  Arab  States,  South  Asia,  and  sub-Saharan  Africa,  where more  than half of men  in most countries recall male-only decision-making on large investments and education (Figure 4). Men's reports of decision-making  about  education  follow the same  general pattern as for large investments, though the pattern is slightly less pronounced.

The  data  from  women  on  male-dominated  decision-making  in their  childhood  homes  follow  a  pattern  that  is  similar  to  men's overall,  with  close  to  or  more  than  half  of  all  women  reporting male  domination  in  large  investments  in  the  Arab  States,  South Asia,  and  sub-Saharan  Africa  (Figure  5).  Clear  regional  patterns can be seen. The percentages are especially high (near or above 70  percent)  in  Morocco  and  Nigeria.  Male  domination  in  these decisions  is  somewhat  lower  in  Eastern  Europe  and  Central  Asia and  in  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean.  Women  report  that  in some settings (Morocco, Palestine, Lebanon, and Nigeria), decisions about education in their childhood homes were considerably less male-dominated than decisions about large investments. The global average  shows  that  across  all  of  the  countries  with  significant results, decisions about children's education were generally more likely  to  be  made jointly by men and women than decisions about large investments.

The  key  finding  is  that  much  of  the  current  generation  of  adults across  the  world  isare  to  their  fathers  -  or  other  men  in  the household  -  dominating  the  important  decisions  of  their  lives. From a developmental perspective, memories of household domination by men can often normalize - for boys and girls, women and men, and all individuals - the idea that men's dominance and prominence are normal, accepted, and the way 'things should be.' Women's  economic  empowerment,  full  labor  force  participation, and overall agency will continue to be constrained as long as this is the case.

## Care leads to care: Men whose fathers were involved in caregiving are more involved themselves.

Global data show that women perform on average 3.3 times the daily unpaid care men do. 16  This discrepancy is one of the single largest drivers of women's curtailed educational opportunities, careers, and leisure time. Increasing equality in unpaid caregiving is fundamental to achieving gender equality. IMAGES explores this dynamic using an  intergenerational  perspective,  asking  respondents  about  care distribution  in  their  childhood  homes  as  well  as  in  their  current homes as adults. 17

Recalling their childhood homes, too many respondents tell of their fathers playing a limited or nonexistent role in the routine care work of cleaning the house, preparing food, and washing clothes. In nine available  countries,  a  majority  of  male  respondents  recall  their father never doing any of this work; in several others, the majority say their father did one or two at most (Figure 6). East Asia and the Pacific stands out for its higher involvement rates among fathers, as reported by their adult sons. Sixty-eight percent of men in China, 67 percent in Papua New Guinea, and 62 percent in Vietnam share that their fathers were regularly involved in all three of these tasks. At the other end of the spectrum, the Arab States is the region that most consistently  features  the  lowest  reported  rates  of  participation in care work, though countries from other regions also have very low participation rates: 71 percent of men in Egypt, 64 percent in Pakistan,  63  percent  in  Rwanda  and  Morocco,  and  58  percent  in Bangladesh report their fathers participated in none of these tasks. South  Asia  shows  tremendous  variability,  where  deeply  involved fathers  were  essentially  nonexistent  in  the  Afghanistan  sample, yet nearly 80 percent of respondents in Sri Lanka witnessed their fathers perform two or more tasks.

These rates matter on their own and also because of how influential they  can  be  for  future  generations  of  sons  who  witness  these patterns.  The  slight  generational  trend  in  Figure  7  affirms  that even as women's participation in the paid workforce has increased in  recent  decades,  men's  increases  in  caregiving  contributions remain limited. Men over the age of 50, recalling childhoods in the 1970s  or  earlier,  report  the  lowest  involvement  by  their  fathers in  care  work.  Respondents in  the  youngest  age  group,  who  were children in the 1990s and early 2000s in most cases, report their fathers were significantly more involved. Younger men (aged 18 to 34) report having witnessed their fathers performing an average of  1.56  tasks  of  the  three  listed  (cleaning  the  house,  preparing food,  and  washing  clothes),  while  the  oldest  men  (aged  50  to  59) report  having  witnessed  their  fathers  engaged  in  an  average  of 1.14.  Women paint a less rosy picture of their fathers' involvement in these tasks, with women in all age groups from 25 up reporting their fathers performed an average lower than even one caregiving task.  The subtle increase in women's estimations of their fathers' participation over time shown in Figure 7, however, does suggest that fathers may be playing a slightly larger role in the present day than decades ago, but the rates in most places remain very low.

Finally, IMAGES data demonstrate that beyond just the mere passing of time, it is witnessing involvement in domestic work that can lead to  increased  involvement  among  future  generations.  The  final

infographic of this set (Figure 8) shows that in most study countries, men whose fathers were more involved in unpaid care and domestic work are more likely to be more involved in this same work when they  become  parents.  Moving  from  the  group  whose  fathers  did no  domestic  work  to  those  who  did  one,  two,  and  three  tasks  in turn, a similar upward trend is visible in men's own participation at statistically significant levels.

It  is  puzzling  that  fathers'  contributions  do  not  make  even  more of  a  difference  in  male  respondents'  contributions  to  their  own households.  Data  show  that  even  when  respondents'  fathers participated in three tasks, the respondents themselves (e.g., in the Arab States) participate in fewer than three tasks on average. Other factors are surely at play here, including cultural norms that vary across settings such as Vietnam and Egypt and, perhaps, a global trend toward gender conservatism across many parts of the world. There are no simple solutions to erasing the pervasive inequality in unpaid care and domestic work worldwide, but data show that as individual men increase their participation in care work, involvement pays forward by increasing the likelihood that their sons will follow suit.

## Multiple and overlapping forms of violence during childhood are common.

Global statistics find  that  approximately  one  in  two  children experiences some form of violence. 18  About three in five children aged 2 to 14 worldwide are regularly physically punished by their caregivers, and one in ten girls worldwide (or around 120 million girls) have experienced forced sexual acts. Compared with other types of violence against children, emotional abuse receives less attention because of its intangible nature. Research affirms, however, that 36 percent of adults report having experienced childhood emotional abuse. 19   This  is  twice  the  proportion  of  those  reporting  physical abuse (about 18 percent), sexual abuse (8 to 18 percent), or physical neglect  (about  16  percent).  Emotional  abuse  harms  millions  of children's lives globally, and it is estimated that one in every three children is currently experiencing it. 20

Global data show strong correlations between having experienced violence (physical, sexual, emotional, and/or school-based violence) as a child and having witnessed one's mother experiencing violence, and that both are linked to adult perpetration of violence. A metaanalysis from 17 countries found that adults exposed to four or more adverse  childhood  experiences,  including  physical  and  emotional abuse,  stood  seven  to  eight  times  the  chance  of  perpetrating interpersonal violence. 21  Childhood exposure to violence has clear intergenerational effects. 22

A large proportion of IMAGES respondents report they experienced physical  violence  in  their  childhoods  and/or  witnessed  physical violence against their mother by their father or other male partners of  their  mother.  There  is  wide  variation  in  rates  of  these  multiple forms  of  violence  across  the  IMAGES  countries.  However,  the intersection  and  concurrence  of  these  two  forms  of  violence  experiencing and witnessing it - stand out strongly in the IMAGES data.  As the bottom row shows - those representing the percentages of each sample that experienced and witnessed physical violence  -  show  in  Figure  9,  many  male  respondents  -  including about  one  in  five  in  Mozambique,  Nigeria,  Mexico,  and  Morocco; one in four in Papua New Guinea; one in three in Bolivia; and one in two in Pakistan - endured both forms of violence in their childhoods.

The  patterns  of  experiencing  and  witnessing  physical  violence look  similar  for  women  and  for  men,  though  men  report  having experienced higher levels of this violence as children. Mexico and Nigeria  stand  out  as  settings  where  all  or  nearly  all  men  report having  experienced  physical  violence  as  children,  and  Uganda  is notable as a place where men universally report having witnessed physical violence against their mothers when they were children. To validate the findings on these three outlier countries, the data were  compared  with  2020  World  Health  Organization  (WHO) data. 23  The WHO data show that 63 percent of boys and girls aged 1  to  14  in  Mexico  reported  having  experienced  violent  discipline in  the  past  month,  lower  than  the  IMAGES  results;  in  Nigeria, this WHO  figure  was  86  percent  for boys and 84 percent for  girls.  The  WHO  data  on  Uganda  showed  that  65  percent of boys and 67 percent of girls had witnessed physical violence  in  the  home  before  age  18,  yet  85  percent  of  boys and girls aged 1 to 14 had experienced violent discipline in the past month .

GENDER ATTITUDES

## HEADLINE 4

## Inequitable ideas about manhood and masculinity are alive and well.

Restrictive, inequitable,  and  stereotypical  views  of  men's  and women's roles are highly prevalent across IMAGES settings. IMAGES assesses ideas about traditional masculinity and masculine norms as a primary focus, and this section explores three statements in particular:  'A  man  should  have  the  final  word  about  decisions  in his home' (power); 'A woman's most important role is to take care of  her  home  and  cook  for  her  family'  (household  gender  roles); and 'A woman should tolerate violence in order to keep her family together' (violence).

As Figures 10 and 11 demonstrate, IMAGES data show that men in the Arab States have consistently traditional and inequitable ideas about gender, with Egyptian men most committed to all three measures of traditional or restrictive manhood, and Lebanese men the least, particularly with regard to tolerating violence. Men in sub-Saharan Africa  appear  to  hold  traditional  ideas  of  masculinity  overall,  but Mozambique  is  an  interesting  exception,  with  distinctively  lower levels of traditional, restrictive attitudes across all three measures. Men from South Asia and from East Asia and the Pacific share similar attitudes, with a strong emphasis on the importance of maintaining inequitable gender roles.

Women in the five regions for which we have data are far less likely to hold consistently traditionalist views, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where women show the greatest agreement with men on the three dimensions of traditional gender roles. Women in South Asia largely agree with stereotypes regarding gendered power and roles but do not feel women should tolerate violence from male partners. Women in the Arab States, like men in the region, have the most consistent adherence to all three dimensions of traditional, inequitable gender norms. Overall, however, it is traditional attitudes about roles and power that women and men are more likely to uphold, while women and men appear to be less accepting of the view that women should tolerate violence from a male partner.

What these figures show us is that gender traditionalism is alive and well, including support for maintaining inequitable gendered roles, men's domination in decision-making, and justification of violence against  women.  At  the  same  time,  though,  these  attitudes  vary substantially  and  point  to  opportunities  to  shift  gender  norms  by building on change that is already happening.

## Progress to equity stalled: Younger men rarely have more gender-equitable attitudes than older men.

Alongside recent increases in the global discourse about gender equality,  one  might  expect  to  see  a  meaningful  shift  in  attitudes about these topics over time. But do younger people actually hold more  equitable  views  about  gender  than  older  people  do?  In  an analysis  of  the  three  previously  mentioned  dimensions  of  gender attitudes (power, household gender roles, and violence), the answer for young women is mostly yes , while the answer for young men is sometimes but mostly not . For this analysis, a single measure of how gender equitable a person's attitudes are was created from these three attitudinal measures. Respondents received a score of 1 for each of the three statements they disagreed with, for a scale score total of 0 to 3, with a higher number indicating more equitable views.

Among  men,  age  cohort  is significantly correlated with the combined attitude score in 16 studies (Figure 12). To be sure, in select locations such as Georgia, Lebanon, Chile, and Cambodia, younger age cohorts consistently hold more equitable scores. More often than not, though, this significant relationship seems to show that men's attitudes follow a curved pattern, whereby the oldest and the youngest men hold more restrictive views than those in their early 30s.

Among  women,  however,  the  relationship  is  more  consistently positive  across  all  age  groups  (Figure  13).  As  a  whole  (with  the exception of Uganda), the directionality is clear: Younger age groups of  women hold significantly  more  equitable  views  than  older  age groups do, especially when taking an average of the 12 studies in which this relationship was statistically significant.

Younger men's restrictive gender attitudes seem consistent during an era of backlash against the progress of women's movements and amid the rise of anti-feminist political leaders, a push back against the women's rights agenda, and in some countries, 'men's rights' and  male  supremacist  groups,  particularly  in  online  and  social media spaces frequented by young people. We can also hypothesize that the youngest groups of men - especially those not yet partnered or raising children - hold idealized or hypothetical notions of their (future) roles in heterosexual relationships, while men with the lived experience  of  cohabitating  and  cooperating  with  their  partners have come to a slightly more equitable worldview. Regardless, this pattern questions the idea that the younger generation of men is more likely to buy into gender equality. For many younger men in some settings, the case must still be made for why gender equality is urgently needed and has not yet been achieved,  which presents a serious challenge for policymakers, activists, and educators alike.

Nonetheless, it is notable that no statistically significant link exists between age groups and these three gender attitude statements in fully half the studies available among men. This is further evidence that social change in gender issues is more than just a matter of inevitable generational change. This work demands more dedicated and country-specific action to shift the views of every succeeding wave  of  young  men  and  new  parents.  Notably,  combining  all countries where this relationship is significant reveals that no men in any age  group  have  as  progressive  or  equitable  views  as  even theeven the the age groups of women with the least equitable views.

## Many men support equality in the abstract but defend their privilege and the status quo in practice.

Pushing men on a full gender equality agenda requires (1) assessing men's willingness to make concrete changes that would reduce their privilege in relation to women; and (2) addressing homophobia and heteronormativity, which are key pillars in reinforcing patriarchal privilege. In exploring these topics, IMAGES data frequently point to a mismatch between respondents' willingness to support broad notions of equality and their reluctance to embody that support on a closer personal and political level.

First,  IMAGES  data  often  find  that  men  show  moderately  high support  for  gender  equality  in  the  abstract;  this  is  evidenced  in Figure 14 by the high proportions of men disagreeing with the notion that 'more opportunities for women mean that men lose out.' This disagreement  implies  that,  in  general,  men  feel  they  don't  stand to  suffer  when instrumental changes are put in place to advance women's opportunities. It is, therefore, notable that when asked to support a specific policy that puts this view to the test, they show far lower rates of support. With the exception of Lebanon, when asked about quotas for women in executive positions and in government, a concrete example of 'more opportunities for women,' men show lower levels of support compared to their more general attitude. An abstract notion of equal opportunity is easier to support, it seems, than specific step to make that notion - and its associated challenge to the patriarchal status quo - real.

IMAGES  data  in  certain  settings  also  explore  a  similar  dynamic with  regard  to  homophobia.  Many  researchers  have  shown  how homophobia  is  a  core  dimension  of traditional masculinity. 24 The  questionnaire  included  items  to  assess  attitudes  on  LGBTQ

identity  and  rights  and  on  homophobia,  including  the  statement: 'Homosexuality  is  natural  and  normal.'  While  not  asked  in  a preponderance  of  settings, 25   in  most  cases,  majorities  of  men and/or  women  agree  with  this  positive  statement.  Morocco  is  a notable exception here. A second item situates the topic closer to home, representing a concrete application of this abstract value: 'I would be ashamed if I had a homosexual son.' Where included in the questionnaire, this discriminatory idea is quite well supported. Majorities of men in ten of 15 locations agree with this statement. IMAGES data suggest that these two seemingly contradictory ideas can  exist  simultaneously  within  the  same  community  and  same mindset. In sum, many women and men may accept sexual diversity in  the  abstract but show homophobic views when the question is poised in a more personal way.

## HEADLINE 7

## Women and men who grew up seeing gender equality in their households as children hold more equitable attitudes.

Despite  the  global  consensus  -  as  expressed  in  national  laws and  international  agreements  -  on  the  need  to  achieve  gender equality,  the  prevailing  social  norms  and  expectations  that  men are breadwinners and women are housewives/caregivers are still pervasive and widely embraced. 26  Of course, neither women working outside the home nor men doing caregiving work necessarily means gender equality. What is more, women and men may engage in these activities out of necessity rather than choice. And women working outside the home may still be expected to shoulder a double burden of unpaid care work at home.

A  study  of  29  countries  found  that  adult  sons  whose  mothers were employed outside of the home when they were boys spend more time in caregiving for their own family, while adult daughters of  these  mothers  spend  less  time  doing  housework. 27   A  higher percentage of women working outside of the home helps challenge those social norms, though in many settings, it has not led to male partners'  increased  engagement  in  caregiving  work 28 .  IMAGES data show that specific modeling by a parent of the same sex can have important effects on that individual's gender attitudes.

As Figure 15 shows, men who saw their fathers heavily involved in household work tend to hold significantly more gender-equitable attitudes. Kuwait, Azerbaĳan, and Tanzania stand out as countries where  the  difference  between  the  gender  attitudes  of  men  who did or did not have involved fathers is particularly large. Similarly, women  who  saw  their  mothers  working  outside  the  home  have significantly more gender-equitable attitudes. In each case, behavior by  the  same-sex  parent  that  went  against  the  gender  stereotype had lasting effects in the attitudes of their children. To be sure, there are 'exceptions that prove the rule' in both charts in Figure 15; in India and Indonesia among men and Afghanistan among women, these relationships are statistically significant, though not at a high real-world magnitude, in the opposite direction. Yet by and large, we find that the legacy of nontraditional gendered behavior on the part of parents lives on in the attitudes of their children. Of note, it may be that women are more likely to report their mothers working because, in general, they paid more attention to their mothers' roles inside  and  outside  the  home  as  they  assessed  their  own  future prospects and life trajectories, whereas boys might have paid more attention to their fathers' trajectories and behaviors.

Finally, IMAGES  data  demonstrate  that  mothers  and  fathers reinforce each other's influence when they make choices that differ from the traditional gender norms. When both parents engage in nontraditional gender activities, their actions reinforce those of the other person to shape the attitudes of their children. The attitudes of women and men together reflect the influence of both parents' modeling in heterosexual households. When both parents adhered to gender-traditional practices, their children's attitudes as adults are  the  least  gender-equitable  (Figure  16).  When  one  parent  was less traditional, it was mothers' work outside the home more than fathers' caregiving that had the greater impact on their children's attitudes. When mothers worked outside the home and fathers were very involved as caregivers, their combined impact was the greatest on transmitting gender-equitable attitudes to their children.

The scale score is again drawn from agreement/disagreement with three items: 'A man should have the final word about decisions in his home' (power); 'A woman's most important role is to take care of her home and cook for her family' (roles); and 'A woman should tolerate violence in order to keep her family together' (violence). A higher number indicates more equitable views. Findings are significant at the p &lt; .05 level.

POWER AND CARING AT HOME

34

## HEADLINE 8

## Household power is unequal and contested between women and men, especially with regard to money and women's mobility.

IMAGES results find that countries vary considerably on whether household decision-making is male-dominated for large household investments (things like buying a car, a house, or furniture). Significant regional variation is visible in men's and women's responses, with Latin America and the Caribbean showing the lowest proportions of male domination in household decision-making and much decisionmaking shared equally overall, likely reflecting women's relatively high labor force participation in the region. Across the regions, there is strong agreement between men's and women's assessments of the household dynamic. In general, the theme expected to appear men giving themselves more credit for equal sharing than women recognize - did not emerge. If anything, the opposite is true: Women report  they  have  some  contributing  power  in  the  'share  equally' scenario, but the same percentage of men don't see it that way, and insist on or perceive their primacy in financial decision-making.

One  universal  finding  is  that  if  one  disregards  'shared  equally,' Bolivia is the only country where women are more likely than men to report making the final decision (gray compared to blue in Figure 17). The highest overall levels of male domination in decision-making can be seen in the Arab States and in sub-Saharan Africa. Eastern Europe and Central Asia shows the greatest variability within a single region, ranging from 43 percent of men and 41 percent of women reporting male domination in decision-making in Azerbaĳan to 16 percent of men and 11 percent of women in Croatia saying the same. Indeed, the levels of men (81 percent) and women (85 percent) in Croatia reporting shared decision-making are the highest across all of the countries for which there are data.

In no country does anywhere near the majority of women report they  have  the  'final  say'  on  how  they  spend  their  own  free  time (Figure 18). In eight of the 13 countries for which IMAGES surveys included  this  question,  men  are  more  likely  to  have  the  final  say than women about women's movement. And the 'shared equally' response when it comes to women's freedom of movement is hardly an indication of equality and autonomy; women alone should be able to decide how they spend their time. Only in Morocco and Kuwait do at least a third of women report that they are making the final decision on their own behalf.

Women's responses to who in their homes has the 'final say with regard to how [respondent] spends her free time': whether she or another female family member has the final say, the final say is shared equally among female and male family members, or a male family member has the final say. Findings are statistically significant at the p &lt; .05 level.

## Household decision-making is more equitable when women have more education and greater economic independence.

Years of research on women's status have affirmed the importance of  education 29   and  labor  force  participation 30   as  key  contributors to  achieving  equitable  household  power.  Women's  responses  in IMAGES surveys show that in many locations, educational attainment and employment status are positively correlated with equally shared or female-led decision-making around major financial purchases. IMAGES data help demonstrate that these aspects of women's lives -  their  educational opportunities, income-earning, and household power - are part of the same equation and the same interlocking set of oppressions and opportunities.

Women's educational attainment is positively associated with equal or  female-led  decision-making  in  seven  of  the  country  studies (Figure 19). While results vary by location, the pattern shows modest increases in decision-making equality as women reach the lower or upper secondary level, and then a major increase for those with postsecondary education. However, these educational opportunities are relatively rare among women in IMAGES studies, meaning that precious few experience this association.  As  Figure  20  shows,  in nine countries, women who were working outside the home for pay at the time of the study played a significantly greater role in major household  financial  decisions  than  those  who  were  not  formally employed.  Overall,  when  these  nine  countries  are  combined  into an average, the scope of this association mirrors that of education, wherein  about  three  in  every  four  women  who  were  formally employed  (the  same  proportion  as  those  with  postsecondary education) say that financial decision-making is shared equally or female-led.  Among  women  not  formally  employed  in  these  same countries, that figure is only 57 percent. The relationship between employment  and  power  seems  particularly  strong  in  the  Arab States;  more  than  half  of  the  total  countries  (included  only  when they  achieve  statistical  significance)  in  both  figures  are  from  the Arab States.

The key finding is that educating girls and empowering them in the labor  market  contributes  to  more  equitable  household  decisionmaking  in  the  long  run.  Many  factors  of  women's  empowerment interact,  including  education,  employment,  and  decision-making, but none of these alone will achieve true equality in the home. For that, we must address the systemic and individual obstacles to men doing their full part at home as well.

## Men's and women's household division of labor is inequitable, but men often don't acknowledge this.

On average, women spend three to ten times as much time as men on unpaid care and domestic work, as noted earlier, independent of  women's  or  their  partners'  employment  status. 31   COVID  has reinforced  women's  domestic  workload,  in  many  cases  obliging them to leave the paid labor force and certainly requiring them to engage simultaneously in caregiving and paid work from home. 32 This ongoing inequality affects women's  employment  and  is associated with their lower wages for the same work compared to men. The IMAGES surveys collect data on whether women and men perform the following (and many other) tasks: cleaning the house, preparing  food,  and  washing  clothes.  The  analysis  shows  that  at least  90  percent (and generally closer to 100 percent) of women everywhere have participated in all three of these tasks.

In contrast to women's near-universal participation in this domestic work,  Figure  21  shows,  men's  reports  of  participating  in  all  three tasks are more limited. The global average shows that fewer than 50 percent of the men in IMAGES samples have participated in all three tasks and that 28 percent have never participated in any of them. Particularly striking is the fact that in El Salvador, India (India-2 only), Bangladesh,  Uganda,  Pakistan,  Lebanon,  Afghanistan,  Morocco, Palestine,  Kuwait,  Azerbaĳan,  and  Egypt,  a  higher  share  of  men have never participated in any of the tasks than have participated in  all  three.  In  Pakistan,  Afghanistan,  Morocco,  Palestine,  Kuwait, Azerbaĳan, and Egypt, more than half of men have never participated in any of them.

In addition, men and women tend to disagree about their respective contributions  to  the  care  of  their  children,  with  men  generally reporting more participation in this care work than women say men carry out. In every country where women's and men's data exist, the proportion saying that daily routine care of the child is 'shared equally' is higher among men (see orange in Figure 22) than among women. Also notable is how rarely overall 'always or usually him' appears. Daily, routine childcare is, by and large, seen as 'women's work,' even as change is slowly happening.

In addition, to the extent that men perform childcare tasks, there is a clear and gendered division of tasks that are performed primarily by women and primarily by men. Drawing on IMAGES data, we can conclude  that  men  play  with  their  children  far  more  commonly than they bathe their children (see Figure 23). Despite considerable variation in the absolute and relative levels of engagement in these activities across regions, one pattern is clear: Men are consistently engaged in more playing and less bathing. The near-global challenge is how to implement policies and other social change to encourage and demand men share fully in all kinds of caregiving.

## Many men exert power and control over women in their lives through multiple forms of violence.

Too many men exert undue power and control over the women in their lives, including and going beyond physical forms of violence. Studies on intimate partner violence have only recently begun to ask men about their perpetration of violence, and IMAGES has sought to  help  fill  this  gap  in  the  evidence  base,  with  an  abundance  of caution and with caveats. Survey data on intimate partner violence likely underrepresent the true prevalence of violence, owing to the sensitivity, shame, and even criminal law connected to these acts. And prevalence surveys do not pick up the most serious of cases: femicide  and  instances  in  which  women  and  girls  may  sustain permanent injury rendering physical or mental disability.

IMAGES  questions  built  on  the  years  of  developing  questions with  women  that  seek  to  reduce  the  stigma  or  fear  of  reporting having experienced violence. Similarly, IMAGES built on pioneering research into men's reports of gender-based violence in locations  such  as  Gauteng  Province,  South  Africa,  in  order  to construct  questions  seeking  to  increase  the  likelihood  that  men would  honestly  respond  about  their  perpetration  of  violence. 33 Women's  responses  present  a  useful  point  of  comparison  to other existing data sources on the prevalence of intimate partner violence  in  the  study  countries,  and  in  most  cases,  are  seen  as reliable  indicators  of  prevalence.  IMAGES  researchers  always receive extensive safety and ethical training and practice prior to fieldwork,  which  is  undertaken  in  accordance  with  best-practice standards  of  privacy,  confidentiality,  compassion,  support,  and safely  distributing  referral  information  for  service  providers  in respondents' local areas.

IMAGES  collects  data  on  psychological,  economic,  physical,  and sexual  violence. 34   Of  course,  other  forms  also  exist,  including reproductive  violence,  and  in  recent  years,  technology-facilitated gender-based violence, in which bullying is permitted and amplified by  devices  and  social  media.  Sexual  violence  is  systematically the least reported form of violence by men, and the gap between women's greater reports of this form of violence is especially large in Tanzania, Uganda, Morocco, and Egypt (Figure 24). Marital rape figures importantly as a form of sexual violence that is commonly disavowed by men yet undermines women's physical and psychological well-being. 35

While  overall  rates  of  intimate  partner  violence  differ  among regions and countries, the overall picture points to the urgency of this  issue.  Men's  use  of  many  forms  of  intimate  partner  violence remains extremely high around the globe, and IMAGES data provide evidence  that  it  is  possible  to  assess  the  extent  of  men's  use  of violence by asking men themselves. Where data are available for both  women  and  men,  women  generally,  but  not  always,  report having experienced higher levels of violence than men indicate they have  perpetrated.  The  exceptions  among  the  countries  included here are Azerbaĳan, Georgia, Egypt, and Kuwait. One explanation for this counterintuitive finding is that where violence is normalized and internalized, women may not even see it as violence but rather as a form of discipline they have 'deserved.' 36  In the case of Egypt, women report higher levels of sexual and economic violence, but men's  much  higher  reporting  of  psychological  violence  'washes out' those results.

## Violence leads to violence.

Existing research on the prevalence and nature of intimate partner violence, primarily with women-only samples, has long shown that witnessing  violence  against  one's  own  mother  during  childhood is  among  the  strongest,  if  not  the  single  strongest,  predictor  of adulthood  experiences  of  intimate  partner  violence.  This  holds true even in multivariate models accounting for several other key factors. 37   On the flip side, as presented earlier, seeing in childhood parents' positive examples (in the form of equitable relationships) can also improve respondents' attitudes and likelihood of participating in unpaid care and domestic work as adults. In sum, parental modeling works in a negative way with regard to violence, just as it works in a positive way with regard to engagement as a caregiver (by fathers) and work outside the home (by mothers).

For the analysis presented in Figure 25, IMAGES male respondents were sorted by whether or not they reported witnessing intimate partner  violence  by  their  father  or  another  male  figure  against their mother. Then, the reported rates of using any form of intimate partner violence themselves were calculated separately for these two groups. In nearly all participating studies, this analysis shows a statistically significant link, whereby  those who  witnessed violence  at  home  were  much  more  likely  to  use  violence  in  their own  adult  relationships.  The  figure  shows  the  statistics  for  all 27  locations  where  this  statistically  significant  link  emerged.  In some  locations,  men  who  witnessed  violence  as  children  have  a likelihood  of  using  intimate  partner  violence  fully  double  that  of those  who  did  not  witness  this  violence  as  children.  This  finding adds  to  the  deep  literature  demonstrating  the  same  unfortunate pattern  for  women,  in  which  having  observed  violence  against one's  mother  shows  a  strong  link  with  one's  own  likelihood  of experiencing  intimate  partner  violence  as  well.  IMAGES  data show  that  many  men  learn  by  example,  normalizing  as  children men's violence  against  women  and  repeating  the  pattern  later  in life themselves.

## Though sexual and reproductive health and rights are often viewed as 'women's issues,' men are participating.

Although  sexual  and  reproductive  health  tends  to  be  viewed as  women's  domain,  the  global  data  show  that  men  are  often supportive and active in decision-making about contraceptive use and antenatal visits, as well as in decision-making on and actions to terminate a pregnancy. They also are often present during labor and  delivery.  IMAGES  includes  four  measures  on  these  issues for both women and men (Figure 26). With regard to who has the final  say  in  contraceptive  decisions,  women  report  65  percent  of those decisions are shared equally, while for men, this figure is 75 percent. However when the 'shared equally' category is added to the response that she has the final say, the total is very similar: 86 percent for  women and 85 percent for men. Similarly, looking at whether a male respondent - or a female respondent's male partner - provided financial support for an abortion, 65 percent of women and 69 percent of men say he did.

There are, however, some important mismatches between women's and men's views. Where men's and women's responses appear to diverge most is in men's physical presence for two important events. The first is whether he attended one or more antenatal care visits during the most recent pregnancy. Women report their partners were with them in the clinic for an antenatal visit significantly less often  than  men  report  having  been  there.  Sixty-four  percent  of women report that their male partners accompanied them, while 78 percent of men report being present for one or more antenatal visits.

The  divergence  is  similar  regarding  women's  and  men's  reports of  where  the  man  was  during  the  last  childbirth:  Nine  percent  of women say that their male partners were in the delivery room, while 31 percent of men say this was the case. Even when the percentage reporting  the  man  was  elsewhere  in  the  building  is  added  to  the percentage reporting his being in the delivery room, the divergent reports from women and men are not entirely reconciled. These two  figures  taken  together  equal  58  percent  for  women  and  66 percent  for  men.  Most  importantly,  42  percent  of  women  report their  male  partners  were  not  present  anywhere  in  the  building, while 34 percent of men say they were not present.

Traditional gendered views about sex and reproduction contribute to poor sexual and reproductive health by impeding communication and  creating  unstated  expectations  and  pressures.  A  look  at men's  responses  to  three  attitudinal  questions  related  to  sexual and reproductive health and rights shows some of the gendered expectations  underlying  this  area.  Men's  responses  to  'It  is  a woman's responsibility to avoid getting pregnant' and 'I would be outraged if my wife asked me to use a condom' vary considerably (Figure 27). At the same time, men around the world show high levels of agreement with the statement 'Men need sex more than women do' - including more than half of men in 11 of the 20 countries for which data are available on this measure.

These  gender-traditional  attitudes  about  topics  related  to  sexual and  reproductive  health  and  rights  shape  relationship  dynamics. In Palestine, Lebanon, Uganda, and Tanzania, more than 30 percent of men who agree it is the woman's responsibility to avoid getting

pregnant  assert  that  contraceptive  decision-making  is male -led (Figure 28). This reflects the view apparently held by many men that men have decision-making power over women's bodies and women should comply with those decisions. On the flip side, men who take responsibility for pregnancy avoidance are less likely to report male dominance  in  contraceptive  decision-making  and  implicitly  show greater support for women's bodily autonomy.

## Adhering to inequitable gender attitudes is bad for men's health.

Globally, numerous studies have shown a link between traditional masculinity and practices that are harmful to men's health, including risk-taking,  substance  abuse,  and  avoidance  of  seeking  care. 38   In some societies, men are expected to remain strong and keep going even  when  they  are  sick  or  injured.  This  expectation  makes  men less likely to seek medical or other forms of help when they need it. Traditional masculinity can also drive men to take risks, and around three-quarters of global deaths from road crashes occur among boys and men. In various societies, masculine norms suggest that men should be knowledgeable and dominant in their sexual activities. These expectations encourage men to have multiple partners, avoid conversations about contraceptive use, drink alcohol, smoke, and maintain other unhealthy practices.

Country-specific  gender  attitudes  were  calculated  together  to determine  each  respondent's  gender-attitude  profile  in  relation to  the  mean  value  within  their  specific  country  context.  Figures 29 and 30 show ten variables covered in the IMAGES surveys for the  countries  in  this  analysis.  Measures  of  agreement  with  three dimensions -   power, roles, and violence - were selected for the earlier analysis of attitudes because they are available across all countries. But as is clear from these figures, these three questions were a small subset of these amazingly rich data. Respondents' answers on every available gender equality survey item from Figures 29 and 30 were combined into a single scale score. For some countries, the scale was based on seven answers and for some ten. These scale scores were  then  divided  into  two  groups:  those  with  gender  attitudes more restrictive than average and those with gender attitudes less restrictive than average. 39  While this is a multicountry snapshot, it is important to keep in mind that the underlying gender attitude scale in each country was slightly different. The emphasis is on the relative restrictiveness of a given man's attitudes about gender compared to his peers.

The  countries  shown  in  Figure  31  are  only  those  for  which  a statistically significant (chi-square) relationship emerged between gender-related  attitudes  and  health  behaviors.  Several  countries with similar trends that fell short of the significance threshold have been left out. A few analyses, marked with two asterisks, are ones for which the relationship moves in the opposite direction from the prevailing trend, also at a statistically significant level. By and large, however,  there  were  strong  associations  in  nearly  all  countries between men holding more restrictive gender norms and specific negative health outcomes.

Men with more restrictive gender attitudes engage in more binge drinking,  with  the  association  between  more  restrictive  views  of gender and more binge drinking being significant and remarkably consistent across Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Men with more inequitable attitudes  are  also  more  likely  to  report  feelings  of  depression,  as reflected in yes/no answers to the question, 'Are you feeling down, depressed,  or  hopeless?'  And  some  men  with  more  traditional attitudes more frequently engage in poor health-seeking behavior: They  often  have  not  sought  any  health  services  for  themselves within the past two years, a very low bar indeed. Yet these data show that  there  are  other  men  for  whom  gender-traditional  attitudes

are associated with greater likelihood of seeking out health care. This may reflect a prioritization of the self prevailing over the sense that  a  'real  man'  does  not  need  to  go  in  search  of  help  with  his health. The high number of countries for which the significance is the reverse of what was expected also indicates that attitudes are not  the  only  driver  of  men's  poor  health-seeking  behavior;  other important factors include men's working lives (their exposures and the flexibility of their time) and the availability of health services.

## Stresses and fears related to providing financially and protecting the family are widespread.

The expectations that men should be breadwinners are strong and pervasive. Men often pin their identities on this financial provider role, but in many economic circumstances, this is impossible. Men face pressures to conform to this role from peers and family, including intimate partners, and their ability to fulfill the role can determine their eligibility for marriage and their satisfaction and stability within that marriage. Men perceive this pressure to be providers even in divergent settings with financial crises, war, displacement, or high unemployment rates. Although the 'provider' identity is expected of all men, structural forces outside their control often curtail their opportunities to fulfill the role.

The IMAGES survey includes a question to assess agreement with the statement 'I am frequently stressed or depressed because of not having enough work or income.' While there is wide variation, the overall results show this 'provider' identity stress is very common: 61 percent of men overall affirm this stress, and the rates are above 90 percent in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Nigeria, and Chile and extend as low as 17 percent in Kuwait. As a region, the Arab States (as represented in Figure 32) shows consistently lower workrelated stress among men than other regions.

Yet when people from the region were asked whether they agreed with  the  statement  'I  worry  about  not  being  able  to  provide  my family with daily life necessities,' at least 60 percent of both women and men responded affirmatively, with the exception of Kuwait (see Figure 33). While they may not have been stressed or depressed, men and women certainly feel the pressures of the role and worry about their ability to fulfill it. Indeed, women in Lebanon and Egypt were more likely than men to agree with the statement on being worried about providing for their families.

A  complementary  aspect  of  traditional  masculinity  is  that  a  man must  be  the  'protector'  of  his  family.  IMAGES  measures  this  by asking whether women and men agree with the statement 'I worry about my family's safety.' In the midst of active political or armed conflict,  the  forces  that  risk  the  safety  and  livelihood  of  men  and their  families  go  far  beyond  anything  under  individual  control. For example, over 95 percent of men and women in Palestine and Lebanon express worry about their families' safety.

War,  economic  instability,  and  other  major  structural  factors continue  to  shape  men's  lives  in  extremely  diverse  contexts  and make it difficult for them to achieve their desired roles as providers. Figure  345  reports  on  the  high  percentages  of  men  and  their families  exposed  to  direct  conflict  in  seven  disparate  IMAGES countries. The experiences reported here highlight the impossibility of fulfilling traditional masculine roles under these circumstances. They  also  highlight  the  extent  to  which  trauma  is  a  reality  in  so many people's lives. From personal experiences of physical violence cited by men in Afghanistan and El Salvador to witnessing killings and rape in Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and Rwanda to active participation as combatants in Nicaragua and Serbia, conflicts have profoundly affected millions of men and women. There is little that they as individuals can do to alter the regional or global political and economic affairs that shape their lives.

## WHAT IS NEXT

## What Is Next? What Will It Take to Bring Men On Board as Full Allies in Gender Equality?

With more than 67,000 respondents from 32 countries over  the  past  12  years,  IMAGES  data  provide  insights  on  the inertia  and  barriers  to  engaging  men  in  gender  equality,  as well as the opportunities for achieving true change. From these  15  headlines,  the  following  emerge  as  key  opportunities for action:

## Masculinities are changing but are also constrained by larger political and structural influences.

The  clear  patterns  across  countries  and  regions  suggest  how much local, national, regional, and global cultural factors influence individual  men  and,  thus,  how  important  regional  and  national policies and circumstances are for achieving change. While IMAGES gathers data on individual men and women, their relationships, and their life trajectories, it is clear how much contextual factors - media, political  realities,  economic  realities,  broader  social  and  gender norms,  national  policies,  and  the  like  -  influence  men's  attitudes, practices, and relationships. in particular urgent action is needed at the local, national and international levels to push back against conservative, anti-feminist movements and voices in some settings by bringing young women and men on board with the full gender equality platform.

## For all the changes in women's educational attainment and workforce participation and in legal changes to build gender equality into national policies, men and masculinities have been slow to change.

Men around the world continue to hold onto views that they should be providers and protectors and suffer considerable stress when they can't achieve traditional versions of  working  manhood. Furthermore, too many stubbornly cling to restrictive, inequitable views  of  themselves  as  making  decisions  for  their  families  and female  partners  rather  than  as  being  collaborative,  egalitarian members  of  the  household.  Many  women  also  continue  to  hold restrictive, inequitable views about men and women, but they are also much more likely than men to question these views. The motor of women, especially younger ones, pushing for equality should be harnessed  and  supported  to  achieve  the  full  promise  of  gender equality - including nudging the younger generation of men toward change.

## Mothers, fathers, and households that are able to break away from gender stereotypes create change that paves the path forward to the next generation and represents a potential motor for faster movement toward equality.

Across  settings  and  on  multiple  indicators,  men  who  saw  their fathers involved in domestic work or taking up egalitarian roles in household decision-making and who saw their mothers in the paid workforce tend to be more equitable and more involved in handson unpaid care and domestic work in their own households when they  become  adults.  This  somewhat  obvious  association  means interventions that engage parents in raising their children in equitable ways are one of the keys to achieving individual and societal change.

## Globally, boys and girls witness and experience multiple and overlapping forms of violence, which pays forward as one of the largest factors in men's use of violence as adults, particularly their use of violence against female partners.

This finding - consistent with other research on the intergenerational transmission  of  violence  -  in  no  way  gives  any  man  (or  woman) an  excuse  for  using  violence.  Instead,  it  reinforces  how  urgently violence  prevention  must  involve  both  reducing  violence  against children  in  all  its  forms  and  also  including  unlearning  violence and  understanding  and  addressing  the  trauma  associated  with childhood  experiences  of violence as  part  of  engaging  men and  boys  in  preventing  intimate  partner  violence.  Ending  men's violence against their female partners requires understanding and preventing  the  violence  that  happens  in  boys'  childhoods.  These are  not  competing  priorities  but  instead  overlapping  urgencies.

## Men's health and well-being are harmed by restrictive norms related to gender roles and masculinities which provides a tremendous incentive for men to be allies in the progress toward healthy masculinity and gender equality.

A  consistent  association  across  diverse  regions  of  the  world  is found between men holding rigid, restrictive views of manhood and their experience of poor mental and physical health. This finding in no way minimizes the agency, opportunities, and quality of life that are denied to women and girls because of restrictive gender norms, gender inequality, and misogyny. The finding that men have worse life outcomes if they hold gender-inequitable attitudes implies that achieving gender equality requires men to understand their stake in achieving healthy, connected, equitable, and nonviolent versions of manhood. It is in appreciating the harm of restrictive gender norms to  men and to women that men can and must be drawn into the journey to gender equality.

## From a research standpoint, existing and new national surveys should ask men and boys about their experiences of gender relations and power and about their attitudes on manhood with a particular lens on men who question inequitable and stereotypical versions of manhood.

IMAGES surveys have been comparatively small in most settings. The  questions  included  in  IMAGES  should  be  incorporated  into larger national, regional, or global surveys so that results can inform policymaking  at  higher  levels.  They  should  also  be  incorporated so  that  more  stakeholders,  including  policymakers,  can  take  into account men's resistance or support of gender equality, as well as expand efforts to engage men as allies for gender equality and in creating healthier versions of manhood for their own well-being.

## The gaps in men's actions to achieve gender equality are evident, but men's support for gender equality provides opportunities to speed up change.

Many research efforts, policymakers, and policies assume that men are  or  will  always  oppose  gender  equality.  And  indeed,  IMAGES results find huge gaps in men's actions for gender equality, whether in  terms  of  their  use  of  violence  against  female  partners,  their restrictions  on  the  autonomy  of  their  female  partners,  or  their domination  of  household  decision-making.  But  there  are  also numerous areas - often unrecognized - in which men are involved and  their  involvement  could  increase.  This  includes  building  on men's  involvement  in  their  children's  education,  men's  frequent reports of playing with children and performing other caregiving roles, men's positive participation in contraceptive decision-making (and  in  abortion-related  decision-making),  and  men's  presence during  prenatal  visits  and  childbirth.  While  men  should  be  doing these things at even higher levels, there is a sizable proportion of men in diverse settings already doing these things. The individual and  social  conditions  that  enable  these  positive,  more  equitable behaviors by some men can offer insights on how to engage more men  in  taking  the  urgent  and  necessary  journey  toward  gender equality, full respect for the rights and autonomy of women and girls, and  nonviolence.  There  is  no  single  path  toward  men's  equitable attitudes and behaviors, but there is much that can be learned from men in diverse settings who are on that path already.

## WHAT IS NEXT

## Call to Action

## GOVERNMENTS

## National ministries and policymaking bodies focused on gender equality should use IMAGES and other gender data to inform policy by increasing male allyship for equality.

IMAGES data  provide  detail  on  the  diversity  of  men  and  specific ideas  on  how  and  where  to  engage  them:  from  prenatal  visits  to sexual  and  reproductive  health  services  to  involvement  in  care work. IMAGES also provides clear measures of men's resistance to gender equality, such as regarding quotas for women in government or university settings. These areas of resistance offer guidance on how to target campaigns and messaging to men. Several national policies were developed in response to IMAGES findings:

In Brazil, data supported advocacy for a national men's health sector within the Ministry of Health and a specific men's prenatal health protocol and online training modules for primary health providers. That  program  has  now  existed  for  more  than  ten  years  and  has shown impact in terms of men's participation in prenatal visits and men's own seeking of primary health services as a result of being 'recruited' into the national public health system via prenatal visits. IMAGES results in Brazil showing that men were going to prenatal visits in large numbers were shared with health ministry officials in Brazil and helped spur the discussions about how to use that positive participation as a point of entry for men into the health system.

In Chile, data on men's participation in prenatal visits and in childbirth were similarly shared with officials in early childhood development and supported the ongoing work to engage men in early childhood development efforts.

## National governments should carry out scans and reviews of their policies on ways to engage men and boys in promoting gender equality.

Such scans should look at policies and initiatives related to health (including  sexual  and  reproductive  health),  caregiving,  violence prevention,  employment,  political  participation,  education,  and more. IMAGES data affirm many opportunities within these sectors where men could be more engaged. Some specific areas, such as prenatal visits, would be easy first steps toward men's engagement.

## Efforts to promote real change in social and gender norms through a gender-transformative approach should be integrated across sectoral policies, from health sectors, to education and employment ministries.

Seeking  to  promote  positive  masculinities,  these  efforts  should go  beyond  merely  engaging  men.  This  work  takes  time,  effort, expertise,  and  the  explicit  intention  to  change  those  norms,  shift opportunities, and build resources and agency for women and girls.

-  Comprehensive sexuality education offers a critical opportunity for young men and young women to learn about equality, respect,

consent, and so on. The IMAGES data highlight how much needs to be done to encourage men to play a more active and supportive role in sexual and reproductive health and rights.

-  Parental  leave  policies  and  early  childhood  policies  should  also look at  ways to engage men from the start in equitable care of young children.
-  Ministries of education and local education bodies should implement campaigns and curriculum reform to promote healthy, equitable ideas of manhood to boys starting at early ages.

## UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM AND DONORS

All United Nations agencies and international donors should include policies and concrete actions for engaging men in gender equality, building those actions into existing funding streams, and assessing movement toward that goal.

The questions and items used in IMAGES provide specific ideas of how change can be measured in terms of attitudes, behaviors, and life outcomes.

Far more needs to be done to support international agreements, national policies, national campaigns, and actions within existing international development platforms to encourage men to lean into a more gender-just world.

Many  existing  platforms  assume  either  that  men's  change  is  too slow to make a difference or that men will not change. Other calls for  action,  such  as  those  calling  on  men  to  do  more  care  work, lack specific goals and targets. Sometimes, the focus is on 'men as champions,' highlighting the actions or words of a few men rather than  the  widespread  policy  and  structural  change  necessary. Drawing on existing successes, such as HeforShe is an important first step.

United Nations agencies and other international bodies that carry out or support regular household surveys and other data collection should include measures of men's attitudes and behaviors, including some of the items from IMAGES, in their instruments.

Over  more  than  a  decade,  IMAGES  results  have  affirmed  that it  is  both  possible  and  strategic  to  assess  men's  acceptance  or resistance to gender equality policies.

The United Nations system and donors can play a leading role in promoting a positive framing of gender-equitable masculinities, going beyond the idea of a zero-sum game when discussing the role of men in gender equality.

Some  discussions  in  United  Nations  meetings  have  suggested that attention to men detracts from or takes resources away from women and girls. The IMAGES data have affirmed the importance of taking a 'both/and' approach to gender equality, recognizing the relational nature of gender dynamics and the harms to everyone of rigid or discriminatory gender attitudes.

## CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS

IMAGES  data  can  support  civil  society  organizations  in  their programmatic actions by providing a stronger evidence basis for their work and providing potential indicators of impact. The work to engage men as allies in gender equality has largely been led by a host of dynamic, creative, and visionary civil society organizations. The  MenEngage  Alliance,  the  global  network  of  male  allyship organizations, currently has more than 1,000 member organizations and numerous regional networks, each of which is addressing the specific  challenges  and  contexts  of  their  respective  geographies. Civil society organizations such as these, informed by IMAGES data, can  in  turn  support  governments  in  integrating  stronger  social change components into sectoral programs in health, employment, education,  agriculture,  and  so  on,  as  well  as  use  measures  from IMAGES as potential indicators of impact.

Programs  should  use  IMAGES  data  to  better  understand  where and  how  men  can  be  engaged  in  gender  equality  and  to  resist backlash movements. The survey data are also a powerful source of information on the overall resistance and specific sticking points in progress toward gender equality. Many civil society organizations (including  those  working  on  women's  rights,  reproductive  rights, and  LGBTQIA+  rights,  among  others)  have  experienced  recent pushback, whether socially or politically, on efforts working toward equality. This pushback often takes the form of directly defending and  championing  a  traditionalist  view  of  the  world  as  a  'zerosum game' that is 'men versus women,' which IMAGES data can powerfully rebut in many cases. Data alone are not sufficient to fully curtail the powerful opponents of gender equality and full human rights,  but  they  can  provide  powerful  material  for  campaigns demonstrating that a more gender-equal world is both good for all genders, families, societies, and economies and is necessary for the well-being and rights of all.

## RESEARCH COMMUNITY

## We continue to need more, and better, research on men's relationship with gender equality in policy and practice.

The tremendous growth in research on men and masculinities in recent  decades  shows  a  greater  maturity  in  the  gender  equality field, which is increasingly recognizing and addressing the relational aspects of gender, in which everyone plays a role. IMAGES seeks to provide ways to standardize and compare men's attitudes, practices, and life outcomes across settings. As challenging and imprecise as that can be, these efforts are useful for painting a more complete picture of how gender is lived by women and men, particularly when triangulated  with  qualitative  research.  Chiefly,  IMAGES  seeks  to show the dynamic nature of relationships, and of men's attitudes and behaviors, and to present the plurality of men. In short, it sees men and masculinities not as 'frozen pictures' stuck in patriarchal, inequitable norms, behaviors, and systems but as mutable, dynamic, and complex.

## Research should go beyond polls and surveys to also explore the nuanced lived realities of gender (particularly among nonbinary and marginalized identities and groups) and the effectiveness or shortcomings of efforts to advance equality.

More qualitative and operational research is needed that is designed to specifically help programmers and policymakers understand the diversity of experiences of gender, as well as which intervention or campaign approaches are most promising.

## PRIVATE SECTOR

## The private sector has an important role to play in developing institutional cultures that permit employees of all genders to engage more fully with family life.

The insights from IMAGES suggest that some key aspects of this institutional culture include the need to:

Offer men the flexibility they need to provide unpaid care to their children and spouses;

-  Convey the expectation that men will play a role in health, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, and carry through on this with information about services, the time to access them, and the insurance to cover the costs involved;
-  Communicate  to  staff  that  gender-based  violence,  including workplace sexual harassment, is always unacceptable and provide workplace-based workshops and training on violence prevention; and
-  Offer  high-quality  counseling  and  support  services,  including opportunities to discuss the role that masculinity plays in making some aspects of life more challenging at times.

25. As noted previously, the IMAGES core questionnaire includes questions on sexual identity and sexual activity of all kinds. However, heteronormativity and homophobia are so widespread that questions about homosexuality were not asked in many settings due to concerns about cultural sensitivities and potential political opposition (see the introduction for a more detailed discussion on the process and considerations around these questions' inclusion). It is likely that the fear of discussing or revealing sexual orientation has meant that sexual diversity has been underreported in countries where it has been asked.
