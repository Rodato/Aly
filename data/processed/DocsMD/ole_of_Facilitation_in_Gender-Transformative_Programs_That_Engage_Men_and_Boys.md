## Introduction

## Background and objectives of this brief

Skilled facilitators are essential to the success of gender-transformative programs. Experiences of gender-transformative programs that  engage men and boys in diverse settings highlight the importance of high-quality facilitation in achieving program objectives and initiating  transformative  change.  This  brief  is intended  for  practitioners  in  the  field  of  male engagement in gender equality and summarizes programmatic lessons on facilitation. It uses examples from Plan International's Strengthening Health Outcomes for Women and  Children  (SHOW) program,  funded  by Global  Affairs  Canada,  as  well  as  from  other program  experiences  from  settings  as  diverse as Bangladesh, Ghana, Haiti, Nigeria, Senegal, Tajikistan, Nepal, Rwanda, and the United States.

The  brief  is  organized  as  follows: The introduction  provides  a  background  on  Plan International's SHOW program and what highquality  facilitation  looks  like.  This  is  followed by  a  section  on  best  practices  and  lessons learned on selecting and training high-quality facilitators,  on  facilitation  strategies,  and  on motivating, supporting, and monitoring facilitators before concluding.

## Background to the SHOW program

SHOW  is  a  multi-country,  4.5-year  gendertransformative project aiming to reduce maternal and child mortality among vulnerable women and children in underserved regions of five countries, namely, Bangladesh, Ghana, Haiti,  Nigeria  and  Senegal ('Global  Affairs Canada  Online Recognition Stories,' n.d.). SHOW  comprises  a  set of comprehensive gender-transformative  approaches  to  engage men  and  boys  as  partners  and  beneficiaries of  gender  equality.  These  include  targeted engagement  of  male  partners  of  women  of reproductive age in groups, of adolescent boys in groups, and of community-based traditional and religious leaders; broad social and behavior change communication (SBCC) campaigns; and  male  engagement  initiatives  by  frontline health providers, including communitybased  health  workers,  to  create  a  broader enabling  environment  for  male  engagement. Of  these initiatives, Fathers  Clubs promote men's equitable and nonviolent involvement as partners in maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) and in sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Fathers Clubs sessions allow men to reflect on what it means to be a man and  a  father  in  the  context  of  these  MNCH and SRHR health needs as well as in broader power  relationships.  Through  this  reflection, men  become  aware  of  how  some  gender expectations  negatively  affect  their  own  lives and the lives of their partners and children.

## What good facilitation should achieve

Effective group interventions foster critical consciousness 1   and  belief  in  the  group's power  to create  change . In addition to participants  learning  new  skills  and  practicing equitable behaviors, the most effective gendertransformative  programs  start  a  process  of critical  reflection  and  build  solidarity  among group  members  to  mobilize  change.  Skilled facilitators can ignite and support this process of developing critical consciousness. For instance, Promundo's approach often includes exercises during which men have the opportunity to listen to  the  voices  of  women  and  vice  versa.  The stories men hear often have to do with women's experiences of bearing the unequal caregiving load  or  of  discrimination  in  the  workplace. Critical  reflection  following  such  sharing  of experiences,  if  guided  by  a  skilled  facilitator, can ignite the process of critical consciousness .

See  the  'Teacher  vs.  Facilitator'  box  in  the next  section  for  how  facilitation  differs  from traditional teaching.

For Freire, this involved 'discussing and reflecting on one's own experiences; […] developing a sense of solidarity with a social group; and making a commitment to making changes in one's own life and context' (quote from Bartel, 2018).

## Facilitation Considerations: Programmatic Lessons and Best Practices

## Selecting suitable facilitators

Consider  the  background  of  the  facilitators selected to implement  your program. For instance,  facilitators  who  have  been  previously trained  as  teachers  can  find  it  difficult  to  adopt a  participatory  style. In  the  Living  with  Dignity program  in  Tajikistan,  seven  of  the  12  recruited facilitators were former teachers. These facilitators were skilled and highly trusted in the community, but they tended to revert to the traditional lecture style of leading sessions, which is not conducive to developing critical consciousness .

See  the  earlier  section  'What  good  facilitation should achieve' for more on how facilitators are essential to building critical consciousness.

## Successful  strategies  for  recruitment  may include  casting  a  wide  net  and  screening .

Advertise widely in the community and highlight strong interpersonal skills as a key  requirement  for  the  facilitator  position. Screening  interviews  that  incorporate  roleplays can be an efficient way to check for the necessary 'soft skills' required of a facilitator.

The  following is an indicative list of the interpersonal skills and qualities that suitable facilitators possess:

- Authentic and sincere
- Humble
- Possesses emotional maturity
- Able to think on one's feet
- Open to other people and new ideas
- Listens actively
- Makes others feel safe
- Guides discussions
- Invites feedback
- Responds to criticism constructively

Feminist and progressive social justice organizations are a good starting point for identifying strong facilitators .  Community organizations  with  progressive  agendas  and feminist non-governmental organizations typically  already  have  deep experience in the communities and can help identify candidates. They  are  also  likely  to  already  epitomize  the values of gender-transformative programs, such as  using  a  participatory  approach,  minimizing harm, centering experiences of women, children, and vulnerable and marginalized groups, among others.

Consider your program objectives to identify  facilitator  demographics,  as  these demographics  may  yield  different  power dynamics in the group . The ideal age range of the facilitator will depend on the objectives of the program. Depending on the region, cultural norms  around  interactions  between  different age groups may affect the program. In Tajikistan, young facilitators leading sessions in the Living with Dignity program found it difficult to guide discussions with older participants present due to  norms  in  the  region  around  reverence  for  older adults .  In  some  contexts,  married  participants may find  it  difficult  to  receive  information  on SRHR  and  gender  equality  from  unmarried adult male facilitators. Similar effects on group dynamics  may  also  result from  hierarchical relations  between  community  members:  If  a respected local leader is selected as facilitator, participants may not feel comfortable opening up or sharing contrasting opinions.

Facilitators should ideally be familiar to the community and able to relate to their lived realities . The  program  should  ensure  that facilitators  are  from  similar  backgrounds  as participants. In  the  Indashyikirwa  program  in Rwanda, the participants who were from rural communities  perceived  the  facilitators  (who were  from  cities)  as  untrustworthy,  unable  to speak the local dialect well, and hence, unable to understand their realities on the ground .

## Training high-quality facilitators

Sufficient time and intensity of training are critical - but there are differing opinions on what is ideal . Bartel suggests that ten days of training is inadequate and that depending on newly recruited  facilitators'  skills  and  experience, 25 days (including booster trainings) might be more suitable (Bartel, 2018).

In South Africa, Stepping Stones and Creating Futures conducted  five weeks  of training and  ongoing  support,  including  two  weeks of facilitators experiencing the curriculum as  participants  themselves  and  two  weeks of  training  on  key  concepts.  In  Nepal,  the Change Starts  at  Home  program  decided  to split  the  training  days  over  a  longer  period of time, opting for six trainings of one, three, or  five  days  each  that  occurred  two  to  three months apart. Promundo's facilitator trainings usually last five days  (or ten  days  if the program is implemented over many months). Following the experience of the SHOW team in  Bangladesh,  who  felt  that  their  three-day training was inadequate, Promundo does not recommend  'cascade  models'  of  training and prefers that the facilitators who will lead the group  sessions  be  directly  trained as much  as  possible.  Facilitator  training  in  the SHOW program for most countries was done using  a  cascade  model,  given  challenges  of geographical  spread.  The  training  lasted  for three to five days, except in Haiti, where the training was  done  directly  with  facilitators over two weeks, which was possible given the relatively small number of facilitators in Haiti. Refresher trainings were also held periodically within the SHOW program . Programs should  include  mechanisms  for  ongoing  and refresher training and support, such as group observations, periodic refresher trainings, and troubleshooting.  Creating  opportunities  for learning  from  each  other  is  also  an  effective way  of  promoting  learning  and  collaborative problem-solving among facilitators.

Discussing the theoretical underpinnings of  facilitation  can  help  clarify  objectives . Facilitators  may  revert  to  lecture-style  modes of  teaching  if  they  do  not  fully  appreciate the  motivation  for  choosing  a  participatory approach. Sharing the motivation and

theoretical basis for this choice can help prevent this. In  South Africa, for instance, the two programs discussed in detail the 'banking' versus  'liberating'  models  of  education  as conceptualized  by  Freire  as  a  way  of  helping facilitators  understand  the  importance  of  not regressing to authoritarian styles of teaching.

## Necessary elements of trainings include

- Content that includes gender as a social construct,  power,  and  violence  against women
- Adequate time to practice facilitation skills
- Learning  to  respond  to  disclosures  of violence and trauma
- Building cohesion in the group
- Strategies to mobilize for social change
- Identifying and addressing facilitators' own biases

Clarify long-term goals together at the beginning . Program  goals  like questioning traditional  gender  norms,  learning  skills,  and building networks to organize and enact activism need to be made explicit and agreed upon with  all  facilitators  and  partners.  Failing to  do  so  can  risk  losing  or  changing  focus  in practice. For  instance,  in  Creating  Futures  in South Africa, facilitators had a different idea of success  than  the  broader  program  -  namely, around increasing rates of condom use - and missed opportunities to challenge gender norms in their sessions .

Involve facilitators in curriculum design . Having facilitators participate in the curriculum development  stage  of  the  program  can  help build  facilitators'  buy-in  and  demonstrate  the importance  of  the  participatory  approach. In Indashyikirwa  in  Rwanda,  facilitators  reviewed the curriculum for two weeks. The heated debate that ensued allowed for testing and adapting the content and showed facilitators the importance of dialogue over getting the 'right answer.' In the SHOW program in Ghana, facilitators' input on the manual helped identify literacy as a key barrier to participants' attendance. The manual was thus adapted with images and illustrations to make it more low-literacy friendly .  A  useful strategy, in circumstances where it is impossible to include facilitators in the design stage, may be  to  develop  a  core  curriculum  that  is  then shared  with  local  partners  and  facilitators  for further adaptation and inputs.

## Teacher vs. Facilitator

Traditionally,  a  teacher  is  an  expert  expected  to  have  all  the  answers.  A  facilitator  need not have all the answers and instead creates an open and safe space to facilitate dialogue and  critical  reflection  among  participants.  Facilitators  ask  unbiased  and  open-ended questions to elicit  detailed,  reflective  responses.  Facilitators  should  also  model  genderequitable relationships; when men and women facilitators are co-facilitating, they should ensure they switch roles of note-taking and leading sessions equitably, share the delivery of content equally, and interact with each other comfortably and respectfully. Additionally, facilitators must ensure that all participants are able to participate and that the discussion is not dominated by the loudest voices or by those who hold power in the community. The following are a few examples of mitigating strategies and techniques to avoid:

An  example  representative  of  many  Promundo  experiences  is  from  the  Changemaker Families  program  in  Bangladesh,  where  gender-inequitable  views  were  brought  up  in the group, often by powerful community members, stifling other opinions. Promundo's approach has been to encourage facilitators to not impose their own views on the group but instead probe the group's views on the statements to encourage reflection, guide discussion,  and  allow  dissenting  voices  to  emerge.  Another  representative  example comes from SHOW in Nigeria, where facilitators would often describe what was happening in  an  image and tell the group the 'right' conclusions to draw. As a result, there was little interactive discussion, and the activity time was almost halved, likely reducing the potential  impact  of  the  program.  In  Bangladesh,  SHOW  facilitators  demonstrated  the participatory approach by sitting on the same level as group members and maintaining eye contact. Even such small gestures can be effective in minimizing power differentials between facilitators and participants.

## Box 2 Same-Gender vs. Different-Gender Facilitators

Programs can often have more than one facilitator leading the group sessions. Depending on contextual appropriateness, different-gender facilitators are usually preferred for leading mixed-gender groups and same-gender facilitators for same-gender groups . Different-gender facilitators working together provides a potential opportunity to model gender-equitable behavior.

See the 'Teacher vs. Facilitator' box for how co-facilitators can model equitable behavior.

## Facilitation Strategies and Potential Pitfalls

Tackling difficult and sensitive topics needs time . Lessons from the Changemaker Families program  in  Bangladesh  suggest  breaking  up longer sessions (if feasible) to ensure adequate depth of coverage for key topics .  Promundo's broader  experience  suggests  that  speaking about violence in a generalized way also makes sensitive discussions  easier  for participants. It  is  imperative  that  facilitators  never  force participants to share experiences they are not comfortable sharing.

See the 'Teacher vs. Facilitator' box for more examples of facilitation strategies.

Empathy as a learning tool has strengths and potential  pitfalls. A review of  the  Boys to  Men  program  in  the  United  States  notes how  positive  representations  of  women  and empathizing  with  their  challenges  can  lead to  powerful  'Aha!'  moments  of  learning  in the  group.  However,  facilitators  have  to  be careful to not reinforce the idea of good and bad  types  of  challenges  or  that  only  some

## Box 3

## Common Challenges Faced by Facilitators

Facilitators may have difficulty operationalizing complex concepts . Gender-transformative programs tackle complex and nuanced topics. Being able to simplify these ideas in a group can be challenging. For instance, facilitators in South Africa found it difficult to operationalize concepts  like  power  and  gender  in  their  sessions.  In  SHOW  Nigeria,  even  where  Hausa translations  were  available,  facilitators  ran  into  problems  conveying  technical  terms  and ended up reading from the manual, which disrupted the flow of the session .

forms of suffering are worthy of empathy . This lesson is particularly important when working with  men  and  boys  for  gender  equality.  As Amanda  Keddie  (2019) describes through an  example,  women  might  be  valorized  as being  more  emotionally  mature  than  men  in an effort to have male participants empathize with  women's  experiences,  but  such  framing can  end  up  reducing  conceptions  of  women as  inherently  able  to  express  emotions  and men  as  inherently  not,  which  is  problematic and counterproductive to the goals of gendertransformative programs.

Reward and acknowledge positive behavior - with caution . Facilitators may want to reward desirable changes to reinforce positive behavior. Acknowledging that this form of positive reinforcement is important to encourage participants,  it  is  critical  to  not  overly  praise the  smallest  of  improvements,  as  was  noted in  some  instances,  since  this  may  undermine the need for participants to keep pushing for deeper change.

Pressure  to  show  results  can  affect  facilitation  quality . Facilitators  in  the  SHOW program in Bangladesh appeared to be pushing participants toward the 'correct' answers in  sessions  in  an  attempt  to  demonstrate  progress .  It  is  important  to  help  facilitators understand that norms change is a slow process and that they should focus instead on critical reflection and dialogue.

Absenteeism can be demotivating . In South Africa, facilitators grew quite frustrated with youth who would not appear for the sessions. As a woman facilitator put it:

Eh, [laugh] I don't know where to start seriously because I have run out of strategies and I realize that I am getting really pissed off with that group. […] the first challenge is that some people won't come for three sessions; they come on the fourth session and be all lost and cocky about it and then not come for three after that (Gibbs et al., 2015)

Strategies like reminder calls and delaying or changing session timings had not worked. Facilitators  began  to  resent  these  participants  instead  of  investigating  reasons  for  their absence. In the South African context, it was important for facilitators to acknowledge the structural barriers that kept participants from attending group sessions and empathize with their inability to attend regularly .

See the brief 'Recruitment and Retention of Male Participants in Gender-Transformative Programs' for ways to improve the retention and attendance of participants.

## Facilitators also may find it difficult to lead discussions and managing group dynamics .

Managing the session time and balancing time between group discussions and interactive activities  is  important  to  meeting  the  session's  objectives.  But  this  can  be  challenging for facilitators for various reasons: for instance, the presence of challenging participants who may dominate the  group  and  act  as  'gatekeepers'  by  stifling  discussion  or  the presence of participants who are reticent in sharing personal experiences. Conducting roleplays during training and refresher sessions may be helpful in building these group management skills.

See  the  earlier  'Teacher  vs.  Facilitator'  box  and  the  'Monitoring  and  supporting facilitators' section for strategies to mitigate this challenge of managing group dynamics and time.

## Motivating facilitators

Paying facilitators can help ensure greater commitment . Facilitation of gendertransformative sessions is intensive and demanding. Not paying facilitators may make it difficult for them to commit the time needed to do it  well,  and  challenges  of  sustainability  can often make it difficult to budget for facilitators. The balance between program sustainability and the need for motivating and fairly remunerating facilitators for work done has to be assessed in each context. A strategy to address sustainability could  be  to  work  with  institutions  and  service providers  that  already  exist  and  add  gendertransformative content to their menu of services offered to communities.

Provide constructive criticism with sensitivity .  While  constructive  feedback  to facilitators  should  be  provided  from  time  to time, it is important to do so with sensitivity. In  SHOW  Bangladesh,  a  perhaps  nervous facilitator  was  speaking  quite  fast,  and  staff members  from Plan intervened at a few points  in  the  session  to  provide  feedback . Such constructive criticism is best shared with facilitators away from the group to avoid undermining or demotivating them.

Create spaces and mechanisms for facilitators to reflect  and  recuperate . In South  Africa,  facilitators  of  Stepping  Stones and  Creating  Futures  found  reflection  diaries and group learning sessions particularly helpful in  reflecting  on  their  own  facilitation  practice and staying motivated .  Allowing facilitators to reflect  on  their  own  techniques  of  facilitation and  build  a  sense  of  community  with  other facilitators can be a powerful motivator.

Correct any perceptions of facilitation as too 'passive.' Facilitators in South Africa found their roles not active enough since they were no longer following lecture-style methods . Orienting facilitators  on  ways  to  engage  participants  and clarifying how transformative changes might be  slower  to  observe  may  be  helpful  in  setting facilitator expectations early on.

## Monitoring and supporting facilitators

Include recommended  times for activities in  manuals . In  Bangladesh,  the  Changemaker Families team suggested including timelines not just  for  the  entire  session  but  also  for  specific activities to help facilitators make sure they were leaving time for critical reflection .  This  can help address  the challenge of balancing  sessions between discussion and interactive activities.

Watch out for the continued perpetuation of harmful ideas . In SHOW  Nigeria, a few facilitators  voiced  the  opinion  that  violence was  a  'misunderstanding'  and  that  women sometimes provoked violence . Facilitators must  be  encouraged  to  push  back  against such harmful norms even if they are reflected in the communities around them. Any refresher sessions and monitoring and supervision structures must ensure that harm to women is minimized and that such harmful notions are not perpetuated by facilitators.

Establish  a  clear  supervisory  process  and structures  from  the  beginning .  Ensuring supportive supervision processes and mechanisms are understood by all and in place from  the  program's  design  phase  can  help make monitoring  and  supporting  facilitators  a more  seamless  process.  To  prevent  reporting processes from becoming  too  onerous for facilitators, technological solutions have worked in  some  cases. In  the  Change  Starts  at  Home

program in Nepal, facilitators shared verbal 'callin'  reports,  where  voice-recognition  software was used to create transcripts to save facilitators time.  Supervisors  also  did  random  reviews  of group session audio recordings and checks via phone interviews to monitor facilitation without overly  increasing  the  workloads  of  everyone involved . When possible, meetings with facilitators should be regular, with at least one or  two  occasions  per  year  in  which  facilitators

## Box 4

## Gender-Transformative Impact on Facilitators

Facilitators often experience deep transformational change through their participation in the program . In Promundo's experience across settings, programs that aim to challenge harmful gender norms cause facilitators to re-examine how they treat people who they care about. For men, this can mean desiring to be closer to their children, communicating with their partner about their dreams for the future, or talking with friends about how to be more gender-equitable men. For women, it can be more challenging; critical consciousness makes them aware of how unequal many of their relationships are, in that they do so much of the domestic and care work. Many exercises in Promundo's programs thus ask women to step outside their box with small acts of 'rebellion' by doing less, while for men it can be about doing more. In South Africa, a male facilitator shared how he had internalized the processes of dialogue and critical reflection:

But ya, they are grasping everything that we are learning in class and there is a high level of […] discussion, and I guess in this point in time they are just showing they are now relaxed with each other and they can relate to one another's feelings and, ya, because there is so much respect in the room.

(Gibbs et al., 2015).

In SHOW in Ghana, a partner shared how her husband who had initially been resistant to the program messages had changed his behavior over time:

Just last month I saw [my husband] post on Facebook that he made my first boy [second born] wash bowls. He snapped it and put it on Facebook and said, 'it is good to encourage our boys to help in the kitchen.' This was from somebody who was very against it… For me, it's a big impact. He tries to say, 'Hey, do this…' [to our son] and he tries to support gender equality.' (Plan International, 2020).

gather  to  reflect.  In  many  contexts  where  the program  sites  are  remote,  it  may  be  difficult to  have  regular  check-ins  with  facilitators.  In such contexts, using social media - like having WhatsApp  groups  -  has  been  successful  in helping  facilitators  troubleshoot  and  ask  for help  in  real  time.  It  is  also  recommended that  issues  and  challenges  be  documented during  implementation  to  be  able  to  respond adequately in future iterations of the program.

## Conclusion

Experiences from diverse settings reveal the  importance  of  skilled  facilitators  -  i.e., facilitators with strong interpersonal skills who encourage reflective dialogue rather than  teach  or  lecture  -  to  the  success  of gender-transformative programs. Ensuring
