## CURRICULUM FOR YOUTH HEALTHY FAMILIES, STRONG COMMUNITIES

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

WELCOME  TO  THE  PROGRAM  H  CURRICULUM,  JOINTLY  DEVELOPED  BY EQUIMUNDO  AND  THE  SEED  FOUNDATION,  AND  WITH  SUPPORT  FROM  THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE. THIS CURRICULUM HAS BEEN ADAPTED FOR THE CONTEXT OF THE KURDISTAN REGION OF IRAQ (KRI) IN 2022.

This  innovative  program  centers  a  family  approach  to  gender  norms,  healthy relationships  between  families,  and  positive  parenting  techniques.  This  program engages  with  both  fathers  and  their  adolescent  sons  to  reduce  intergenerational violence  and  foster  healthy,  caring,  and  supportive  relationships  within  the  family.

Although  complementary  methodologies,  there  are  separate  fathers  and  son's curricula  for  each  target  group.  This  youth  curriculum  is  intended  to  be  facilitated to  adolescent boys aged 15-19. The program for which this was designed engages Kurdish host community members, Iraqi internally displaced persons (IDPs), and the Syrian  refugee  population  in  KRI.

This curriculum has been largely adapted from Equimundo's Program H, designed for young boys. Program H was developed to engage youth in critical reflections on gender and help them build the skills necessary to act in more empowered and equitable ways. These programs have been adapted around the world to sensitize young men to some of the harmful ways they are socialized and to take on more gender-equitable attitudes.

## GUIDE TO USING THE CURRICULUM

Each  session  contains  a  series  of  activities  that  have  been  sourced  from  selected  training  manuals  from countries in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia and adapted where necessary. The time needed for each of the activities and their complexity vary to cater to the curriculum's potential use in diverse settings and with different stakeholders. The activities included in this curriculum are specifically adapted to the context of adolescent boys and young men aged 15 to 24 in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

## EACH SESSION IS DESIGNED USING A STANDARDIZED FORMAT:

- Objectives: The  purpose  of each session is indicated.  Facilitators  can  inform  participants  of the  purpose  before  starting  a  new  session.
- Key  Activities: Each  activity  has  a  title,  which facilitators may choose to share with the group. The activity's recommended length is also indicated but will vary depending on the number of participants and adaptations that facilitators will need to make in relation to the characteristics of the participants and the time available for training sessions/processes.
- Timing: Each  activity  in  the  curriculum  has  a suggested or anticipated time. These are general guidelines and can vary considerably based

on several factors, including the facilitator's comfort with the material, how comfortable the participants are with each other (and thus willing to share), and how talkative the whole group is. Use your discretion and experience as a facilitator to adjust the timing as needed to make the group as  effective  as  possible  without  exceeding  the overall  time  allotted.

- Materials: The  materials  required  to  facilitate the activities are listed. Materials are optional for some  activities.
- Preparation: These are the steps that facilitators should  take,  well  in  advance,  to  prepare  for  the activities. These steps should be completed prior to  each  session  to  save  time  and  to  ensure  the activities  flow  smoothly.

## THEN, FOR EACH SESSION, THERE IS ADDITIONALLY:

- Key  Message(s): The  key  message(s)  of  the activity are indicated. These key messages should be emphasized during and upon concluding the activity.
- Procedure: These are the steps for carrying out the activity.  They may need some adaptation in different contexts. Facilitators should be attentive to  whether  the  steps  are  appropriate  for  the participants  they  are  working  with.
- Group Discussion Questions: Most of the activities  include  group  discussion  questions  to help  guide  the  discussion  on  the  activity  topic. These questions serve as guidance for facilitators. It  is  not  usually  necessary  to  discuss  all  the questions or adhere to the order in which they are listed, and facilitators can use their best judgment on  using  them  depending  on  the  depth  and direction of the conversation among participants.
- Facilitator  Notes: These  are  tips  for  trainers  in relation  to  specific  aspects  of  the  methodology and/or thematic content of the activity that may demand  their  special  attention.

## Checking In and Out

Checking in is a good way to start each new training session. It can be as simple as going around the circle and letting each participant briefly say who they are and how they are doing/feeling. Other areas you can cover when checking in are:

- If  something  new  has  happened  for  them  since the  previous  session
- If  they  have  taken  any  action  since  the  previous session
- One word that describes their state of being
- Their reflection on the discussions so far

In  the  check-out  exercise,  you  can  also  do  a  light debrief of the session to enable participants to share what they most liked (or not) about the activity and what  they  learned.  This  is  also  an  opportunity  to address any emotions that might still need processing before the end of the session.

## Mindfulness Activity

Many,  but  not  all,  sessions  include  a  mindfulness activity. These activities are to help participants relax and  destress  and  to  give  them  a  few  moments  of peace to help process the session's activities and the emotions that  may  have  been  stirred  up.  Facilitate these  peacefully  and  quietly  to  create  a  calming atmosphere.

## Weekly Commitment

At  the  close  of  most  sessions,  participants  will  be asked to take one or more specific actions in line with that week's activities. These actions are specific tasks that  will  help  them  incorporate  the  week's  lessons into  their  daily  lives  and  encourage  them  to  share with  their  families  and  friends.  This  is  sort  of  the 'homework' of the curriculum. In the 'Welcome and Check-In' section of each week, participants will be prompted to speak about how they completed their weekly commitment, if they were able.

## Energizers and Icebreakers

Some  sessions  will  also  include  a  prompt  for  an 'energizer'  or  'icebreaker'  activity.  These  are  very short activities unrelated to session content in which participants  will  get  up  and  move  around.  These activities help to relieve stress and tension, break up sessions with a lot of sitting or discussion, and add an element of physical movement to the session. A number of these activities are included in Appendix A at the back of this curriculum, but facilitators are encouraged to come up with their own if they would like  and  to  modify  existing  ones  to  suit  their  own comfort and that of participants. Think about what you and others might enjoy or what you have done in  groups  with  other  facilitators  and  try  those  out. You might use a different one each time or find one that the group loves and come back to it regularly. Facilitators  are  encouraged  to  use  these  to  help participants feel more comfortable in the space and whenever they feel the energy in the room is getting low.

## F R A N C E GUIDANCE FOR FACILITATORS

reporting. It is important to be aware of the practical realities of the group members' lives and understand that they may face challenges or dangers when trying to make changes.

Changing attitudes and behaviors is a long process. Participation  in  these  activities  will  not  necessarily lead to an immediate transformation of individuals' lives  and  relationships.  However,  it  is  a  big  step toward  promoting  personal  change.

Before you begin, review your own views, assumptions,  and  prejudices,  and  avoid  bringing them  to  the  group.  Be  aware  if  young  men  from particular  social,  cultural,  or  religious  backgrounds trigger certain emotions in you, be they positive or negative, that may affect your own work in the group. At the same time, there will be moments when it is appropriate  and  helpful  for  you  to  share  your  own personal  opinions,  thoughts,  and  values  about  a topic. If the session is discussing a gender-equitable perspective  and  the  group  doesn't  seem  quite  on board, sharing your personal views can help open the door  for  change.

## ASKING QUESTIONS

One of the most important things you will do as a facilitator is simply ask questions. Doing so promotes dialogue  and  opens  new  pathways  for  participants to  explore  the  topics.  To  do  so,  see  your  group as  a  process.  Ask  'process  questions,'  questions that  cause  participants  to  reflect  more,  cannot  be answered with a 'yes' or 'no,' and are unbiased. See the  following  chart  for  additional  tips:

First  and  foremost,  you  should  see  yourself  as  a facilitator,  not  a  teacher.  Rather  than  lecturing,  ask questions  to  better  understand  where  participants are coming from and guide them in group reflections to critically look at harmful norms around masculinity. You do not have to be an expert in the topics you are discussing and do not need to have all the answers. Rather, the role of the facilitator is to create an open and  respectful  environment  in  which  participants can feel comfortable sharing and learning from each other in a safe space.

The  facilitator's  role  is  to  promote  reflection  and participatory learning, present information neutrally, and create a horizontal learning experience in which the  participants  can  learn  from  each  other  and from  active  participation  in  the  activities.  Other information  to  keep  in  mind  includes  being  aware of your position of power, and accordingly, avoiding judgmental and authoritarian attitudes. Never impose your feelings or opinions on the group and do  not  aim  to  instill  fear  because  participants  may 'switch off' their emotions, interest, or engagement with  the  topic  or  feel  paralyzed  while  participating. Always  be  conscious  of  the  language  you  use  and messages  you  present.

Many of the themes in this curriculum are complex and sensitive. During sessions, pay attention to the participants' covmfort level. In some cases, you may need to refer individuals to professional services such as counseling. Before you facilitate any session, it is essential that you have a list of available resources for participants should they need additional assistance and that all facilitators  are  well  versed  in  local  laws on  minors'  rights,  confidentiality,  and  mandatory

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ask process questions. Examples: 'What do you think about discussing this with your parents or your friends?' 'How do you think the conversation would go?' 'What made you think or feel that way?' | Don't ask questions that can be answered with a 'yes' or 'no.' Example: 'Will you discuss this with your friends?'                                                           |
| Be simple . Ask, 'When?' 'Where?' 'What?' 'How?' 'Who?' 'Why?' You should continue with a full sentence. Examples: 'What were you thinking when that happened? Why do you think that is?'           | Don't ask a leading or biased question. Example: 'In order to be a good father when you are older, will you never yell at your children?'                                    |
| Be unbiased. Exclude your own feelings and values from the questions, and instead guide participants in identifying problems and solutions.                                                         | Don't ask too many questions at once. For young people to fully comprehend and answer your prompt, limit yourself to one or two at a time, with probes and follow-ups ready. |

There  are  many  group  discussion  questions  listed for  each  activity  to  help  participants  explore  and understand the issues at hand. Use these questions as a guide for conversation, not a checklist. What is likely to happen is that some of the issues raised by the questions will come up organically in the discussion, in which case there is no need to ask it again. Other questions may be answered by someone while they are  answering  a  different  question.  Sometimes,  a group member will ask others a question from the list without even knowing it. All of that is fine.

Overall, you want the discussion to feel comfortable and  natural for the participants. You  may  also combine  or  reword  the  questions  to  make  more sense or to refer to something that was said earlier, which helps the question feel more relevant to the group. Sometimes, if it seems like a question is too sensitive for the group at that time, you may choose to skip it or save it for a future session.

The more you get to know your group and develop your experience as a facilitator, the more comfortable you  will  feel  with  the  discussion  questions.  Just remember, the group is not students preparing for a test, and you are not a lecturer. You are a facilitator, and as such, are leading a discussion among friends.

## TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL FACILITATION

The  following  are  several  useful  tips  to  help  you lead  the  group  sessions.  These  tips  will  help  you to  encourage  and  create  a  respectful  environment in  which  young  men feel  comfortable sharing their opinions  and  experiences,  as  well  as  listen  to  and learn  from  others.

- Remember the group agreements. In  Session 1, the facilitator will ask participants to decide on a set  of  agreements.  Throughout  the  curriculum sessions,  remind  them  of  those  agreements. Important  group  agreements  relate  to  listening to  and  showing  respect  for  others  (e.g.,  not talking  when  others  are  speaking,  not  making rude  comments,  or  not  talking  on  the  phone), confidentiality, and participation.
- Do  not  judge.  Remember, you are here to facilitate  discussion  and  reflection.  Your  role  is not  to  teach  or  punish  anyone.  Be  friendly  and create  rapport  with  your  participants.  Be  aware of your own position of power - avoid judgmental and  authoritarian  attitudes.  Never  impose  your feelings  or  opinions  on  the  group.
- Promote  inclusion. Ensure  that  all  participants have  the  opportunity  to  speak.  Be  careful  not to  let  one  person  dominate  the  conversation or  make  other  people  feel  that  they  cannot share their opinions. Encourage people to share their  experiences  and  learn  to  identify  when people want to speak but may be too shy to say something unless called on. If a participant begins to take over a group by spending too much time with  a  story,  find  an  opening  and  kindly  say,  'It sounds like you have a lot of valuable experiences to share with the group. That's great! Do others have similar  or  different  stories  they  would  also like  to  share?'
- Address participants' concerns. The group meetings can serve as an important opportunity for  participants  to  receive  help  and  advice.  As  a facilitator, it is important that you validate people's

concerns,  but  you  can  also  engage  the  larger group  in  helping  to  propose  solutions.  Ask  the group, 'How do you think this problem could be solved?' or, 'Has anyone faced a similar situation? What did you do?'

- Know and use referral services. Some problems that participants face may require outside support. In addition, some participants may prefer to  discuss a particular topic, obtain information, or  seek  support  outside  of  a  group  setting,  or they may  need  attention  from  a specialized service  provider.  As  a  facilitator,  you  should  be knowledgeable  on  places  where  you  can  refer participants  if  needed.
- Manage conflicts respectfully. If a conflict arises among  the  group,  or  if  a  participant  shares  a discriminatory  view,  remind  the  participants  of the group agreement. Encourage other members to  help  mediate  the  situation.  Ask  the  group what  they  think  about  the  question  raised  or how they  would  suggest  handling  the  problem. When necessary, you can offer brief responses to questions  and  clarify  misinformation.
- Appreciate  honesty  and  openness. Encourage participants to be honest and open. They should not be afraid to discuss sensitive issues for fear of  ridicule  from  their  peers.  Thank  the  group members  for sharing their personal stories. Never force anyone to participate in the activities. Instead, try to create an environment in which the participants  feel  comfortable.
- Promote  movement  and  interaction. Include as  much  physical  movement  as  possible  so that participants remain active, alert, and interested.  You  are  encouraged  to  use  short energizer activities in between activities to keep the  participants  engaged  in  the  topics  you  are discussing.
- Manage  your  time. Keep  track  of  time;  do  not spend  too  long  on  a  given  activity  or  session. Keep  in  mind  participants'  attention  spans  and schedules.
- Ask  for  feedback. Use  a  'check-out'  to  receive regular feedback from participants.  What  do they  like  and  dislike  about  the  activities?  What is  working  or  not  working?  Use  their  input  to improve  the  sessions.  Do  not  divert  from  the planned activities but use feedback to improve the running of the sessions (for example, by including more  energizers).
- Be respectful in your presence and appearance. Try to be as respectful as possible in your appearance and your nonverbal and verbal presentation.  This  includes  the  way  you  dress

(avoiding clothes that distract) and address participants (work on remembering their names a  simple  name  game  can  help  with  that).

- Be careful of topics that may cause retraumatization. Given  some  of  these  issues' sensitivity, it  is  possible  that  participants  will bring up personal experiences of sexual trauma or abuse.  Under  SEED's  reporting  requirements  for facilitators and staff as part of child safeguarding, all forms of potential or suspected harm to a child must  be  reported  (including  actions  or  failings that  place  children  at  risk  of,  or  result  in,  child abuse,  including  physical  abuse,  sexual  abuse, emotional abuse, exploitation, injury, neglect, and any  other  harm,  whether  perpetrated  externally or  internally).  Thus,  it  is  important  that  at  the beginning of each session, you remind participants that they are welcome to leave the room if they feel uncomfortable. They are not required to share any  sensitive  information,  and  for  those  under 18,  you  as  the  facilitator  are  required  to  report instances  of  abuse.  This  should  be  repeated  at the  beginning  of  particularly  sensitive  activities as well. Also remind participants of the resources available to them and that you are available after the  session  to  talk  further.  Refer  participants  to service providers with whom they can discuss any issues they may be having. It is also helpful to go over the ground rules (group agreements) about respecting  confidentiality  in  the  group  setting, and the participants should also be reminded not to  share  any  personal  information  that  they  do not want to be revealed outside of the group.
- Keep discussions from straying too far from the key messages. One  of  the  main  facilitator  tools you  can  use  is  the  'bank,'  also  known  as  the 'parking lot.' While all discussions are welcome, if  a  participant  brings  up  a  topic  that  cannot  be addressed within the time allotted, write it on a flipchart paper called the 'bank' or 'parking lot.' It  is  important  that  these  topics  are  revisited  at another time. However, if the topic is completely unrelated  say  something  like,  'That's  a  great comment.  We  don't  have  time  to  address  that right  now,  but  let's  talk  more  about  it  after  the session.'
- Be friendly and create rapport with your participants. As  a  facilitator,  you  are  not  an authority figure. You are not sitting in judgment or giving participants grades or evaluations. It is fine and  even  encouraged  to  joke  with  participants, call each other by first names, and share personal stories  (as  appropriate).  All  of  that  builds  the relationships that make the group effective. You are  encouraged  to  share  in  the  group  examples from your life, and your own struggles, challenges,

- and  realizations.  Doing  so  provides  an  example for the group and helps them see that change is possible  and  what  the  process  of  change  looks like.  You  do  not  have  to  be  perfect,  just  on  the same path to personal growth that you are asking the  participants  to  walk.

## RUNNING EACH SESSION

- Review the session and guidance. Prior to each  session,  review  the  'Materials  Needed,' 'Preparation,'  and  'Facilitator  Notes'  sections, as  well  as  the  activity  procedure.  This  will  help ensure  that  you  are  prepared  to  facilitate  each activity and will allow you time to gather additional materials and become more informed on the topic if  necessary.
- Prepare  the  space. When  preparing  the  space, always  arrange  chairs  in  a  circle  for  all  sessions unless otherwise noted. It is recommended that during the sessions, you offer participants some type of refreshment and engage them in physical activity and motion. Beverages and food tend to be  highly  valued  by  participants  and  help  them stay in the group process.
- Check  in  at  the  beginning  of  each  session. It is  important  to  begin  each  session  by  warmly welcoming  back  the  group  and  checking  in.  A check-in  provides  time  for  group  participants  to share  any  thoughts,  personal  experiences,  and comments they have had based on the discussion from  the  last  session.  Spend  several  minutes checking in prior to beginning the day's session. In order to have time for the session activities, keep check-ins brief, without responses or discussion check-ins  shouldn't  be  more  than  ten  minutes.
- Review  the  group  agreements. Most  of  the sessions  will  ask  group  participants  to  share personal  experiences.  To  create  safe  spaces  for participants,  at  the  beginning  of  every  session, review the ground rules that were established by the group in Session 1 ('Welcome, Introductions, and  Act  Like  a  Man').  This  promotes  trust  and confidentiality  within  the  group.
- Carry out the session as written - but be flexible, be  creative,  and  contextualize  activities. Each activity  contains  procedures  to  take  the  group through activities and group discussion questions to prompt critical reflection. The structure proposed in this manual for implementing activities should serve as a general guide; it is not necessary  to  apply  it  verbatim.  Facilitators  can change  the  order  of  certain  activities'  elements or alter the listed examples to make them more relevant  to  their  group's  reality  and  to  reflect

their own knowledge and skills. If the topics and examples  presented  in  these  activities  come across  as  too  abstract  or  removed  from  your reality,  you  can  add  in  examples from your daily life and experiences. This will help participants to be emotionally involved and identify more closely with  the  material.  Sharing  personal  experiences also helps to model the behavior you want from the young men in your group. Be careful, though, not to stray too far from the curriculum, as this can  prevent  you  from  reaching  the  sessions' objectives.

- Use icebreakers and energizers. Icebreakers are short activities that help participants build trust in the group, usually in a lighthearted way. They are a great way to open a session, allowing participants to move around, share, and become comfortable with  one  another.  Energizers  are  short  activities that  are  most  helpful  when  the  group  appears to have low energy, be losing interest, or not be responding to the activity. These help to change the  routine,  get  people  in  motion,  and  relieve fatigue  and  boredom.  They  take  only  a  few minutes.
- Keep group discussions open-ended and among participants. Group discussions can be the most important part of each activity. These discussions are opportunities for young men to reflect on what they've been doing, talk with one another about their  thoughts, and think critically about how to see changes in their own lives. It is important for facilitators to make sure that conversations remain open,  judgment-free,  and  comfortable.  Try  and get the group to talk to one another rather than having one-on-one conversations with whoever is leading the facilitation.
- 'Check out' at the end of the day. End each day with  a  one-word  'check-out'  that  emphasizes some of the key messages or lessons that they learned  during  that  session.  Use  this  time  to reflect  on  the  main  conclusions  of  the  day,  to announce the next activities, or to see what can be improved and what worked well, for example.

## FACILITATING MIXED GROUPS PARTICIPANT DYNAMICS

While  the  sessions  in  this  curriculum  are  just  for young men, there are one or two optional sessions for young men to meet with adult men in a similar group. These sessions are designed to engage participants in critical reflection and to promote dialogue.

In mixed sessions of young and adult men, you may see a range of power dynamics being exercised, for

especially  by  older  men,  including  many  of  those we  are  trying  to  positively  change  through  the curriculum!  In  general,  all  the  previously  discussed principles  apply  no  matter  who  is  in  the  group. However, there are a few additional tips that may be helpful:

- Be aware of family and gendered power dynamics. The fathers in the group may be used to speaking on behalf of their children, but in our groups, we want  to  make  sure  everyone  can  speak  freely. If  fathers  or  young  men  are  trying  to  speak  on behalf of one another, or interrupting each other, gently  thank  them  for  their  enthusiasm  but  say that in the group we want to make sure everyone can  share  their  own  stories.  You  can  even  refer back  to  the  group  agreement  about  making  'I' statements - that every participant should speak from  their  own  knowledge  and  experience  and not speak on behalf of others. As the facilitator, you will need to demonstrate and model paying attention  to  young  people  when  they  speak  as well. Whenever they are talking, look at them and listen carefully to what they are saying. If you are looking  away  or  not  fully  paying  attention,  that sends a signal to adult men and young men that some voices are less important.
- Remember that participants may be less willing to share openly depending on who is in the room. For instance, young men may be less comfortable speaking freely in front of adult men, especially if their father is among them. When these groups are together, don't pressure individuals to share, but  you  can  give  them  additional  time  to  think about their answers to the questions or to write down  and  reflect  on  their  answers  without  the expectation  that  those  answers  will  be  shared. Feel free  to  modify  your  approach  in  those activities accordingly based on how you see the participants responding. Another way to address this  is,  where  appropriate,  to  break  participants into small groups to discuss. Young people may be less comfortable speaking in the large group but may be able to speak openly when they are just  speaking  with  family  members  or  even  in  a small group with one other family group.

## TIPS FOR CREATING A SAFE SPACE FOR PARTICIPANTS AND RESPONDING TO SENSITIVE DISCUSSIONS

Most  of  the  sessions  in  this  curriculum  include reflective conversations about  possibly sensitive topics. As facilitators, it's important to foster a  safe  space  for  the  participants  to  share  their thoughts and emotions. Make sure you are actively and empathetically listening without judging or interrupting the participants' stories. Do not pressure anyone  to  share  but  be  sure  to  allow  participants to  talk  about  what  the  exercise  evokes  in  them, promote reflection, and highlight the key messages of the exercise. If any participant shares any painful experiences,  is  deeply  moved,  or  cries,  you  can implement any of the following recommendations as you  see  fit: 1

- Don't judge. This isn't always easy, but set aside your own opinions to focus on the other person's perspective.  Recognizing  the  participant's  views and  emotions  will  help  them  feel  heard  and understood. This doesn't mean you have to agree with everything the person says - it's about letting them know you care.
- Give the person your full attention. Pay attention with your gaze, your body language, and a warm tone of voice. Maintain eye contact, nodding and giving other cues as appropriate to show you are paying attention, without interrupting. Giving your full attention shows respect, and a person is more likely to remain calm when they feel respected.
- Listen  carefully  (feelings  and  facts). Actively listen  to  the  words  and  experiences participants describe  -  as  well  as  the  emotions  reflected  in their  tone  of  voice,  body  language,  and  other cues - to go beyond words and identify emotions. Listen  with  your  heart,  gaze,  voice,  and  ears.
- Don't be afraid of silence. Sometimes, all a person needs is to be heard or to know you are there. The person may be thinking about what they are going to say next or may need a few moments of silence to  restrain  their  emotions.  Let  the  person  finish speaking before offering a few words of support.
- Say  thank  you. Express appreciation for the participants' openness and confidence in sharing their experiences or for being vulnerable. Comment  that  many  of  us  have  had  painful experiences  with  our  parents  and  being  able  to recognize  them  can  help  us  heal.
- Consider sitting next to the distressed person. You can hold their hand or rest your hand on their back if appropriate in the context, or you can ask the person if they want to go out and get some air  and  accompany  them  if  there  is  a  second facilitator.
- Repeat and paraphrase. Ask questions to confirm and validate experiences that have been shared. Refer  to  the  person's  words:  For  example,  'I heard that Ahmed felt humiliated when his father insulted him. Is that right?' Keep a respectful and nonjudgmental attitude and give the person time to respond. Remember that there is no script

1. Recommendations adapted from Crisis Prevention Institute. (2016, October 12). 7 tips for empathic listening. https://www.crisisprevention.com/fr-CA/ Blog/7-Tips-for-Empathic-Listening

- empathic listening. Respond based on the person, the situation, and the moment.
- Resist the temptation  to  give  advice. Limit yourself  to  listening,  validating  the  experience, being  grateful  for  it  having  been  shared,  and looking for  common  ground  with  the  other participants.
- Follow up. Between sessions or at the beginning or end of the next session, approach the participant who  had  been  emotionally  affected,  ask  how they have been, and suggest other times to meet if necessary  or consider offering information about psychological support services if they are still  distressed.  (See  the  following  guidance  on responding  to  disclosures.)

## RESPONDING TO DISCLOSURES RELATED TO VIOLENCE OR MENTAL HEALTH

Some  problems  that  participants  may  be  facing, such  as  mental  health  issues,  substance  abuse, or  intimate  partner  violence,  may  require  outside support. In addition, some participants may prefer to discuss a particular concern, obtain information, or seek support outside of a group setting, or they may need  attention  from  a  specialized  service  provider. As  a  facilitator,  you  should  be  comfortable  making referrals to SEED's service providers and ensure you do not put the person at risk, and you should consult with  your  supervisor  if  you  are  unsure  of  how  to handle  a  particular  problem.

Use the following guidelines to respond to disclosures of violence or other sensitive issues that might require external,  specialist  services.  Please  always  consult with  your  supervisor  if  you  are  unsure  what  to  do. During a session, if a participant discloses a painful life  experience, you can sit with the participant and ask them if they wish to share their experience. Be sure to avoid pressuring the participant to disclose. Ensure  that  the  group  listens  with  attention  and extreme  respect.

It  is  important  to  establish  if  the  participant  is currently at risk of violence or if this is a story of past violence. If the instance of violence was recent or it seems like they are still at risk, consult with the relevant service delivery coordinator to make a referral. If the instance of violence was in the past, practicing  empathy  and  active  listening  is  very important  to  ensure  the  participant  feels  heard and validated. If the person still seems emotionally distressed  or  has  mental  health  symptoms  as  a result of past violence, consider referring them to mental  health  services.

If a participant reveals that they have experienced or are  experiencing  violence,  it  is  important  to  follow these  steps:

- Listen  with  empathy,  validate  their  experiences and  concerns,  and  be  sensitive.
- Become  familiar  with  the  resources  available locally and have a printed copy available with the names  and  contact  information  of  centers  that offer specialized services for survivors of intimate partner violence. Consult with the service delivery coordinator, Protection and Service Delivery Manager, or Protection Technical Advisor if you  need  additional  support  with  referring  the participant  without  placing  them  at  risk.
- If the person is interested in receiving specialized services (whether internally at SEED or externally), give them the relevant information. Inform your  colleague  about  the  participant  or  inform your  external  contact  at  the  local  center  that  a participant will be looking for help or information.
- Show  the  participant  that  you  care  and  your concern for their feelings.
- Do  all  you  can  to  help  the  person  feel  calm, supported, and connected to others.
- Evaluate  if  there  is  a  current  or  ongoing  risk  of extreme  intimate  partner  violence.
- Discuss the case with your supervisor.
- At  the  end  of  the  session,  sit  with  the  person and ask them how they are doing. You can also suggest the group support the person. In the next session, ask how they fared after the session and during the week.
- If  the  disclosure  of  intimate  partner  violence occurred within the larger group, carefully remind the  group  of  the  agreements  of  respect  and confidentiality.

## Actions to avoid when working with a participant who discloses violence:

- Attempting to solve their problems
- Convincing them to leave the violent relationship
- Convincing them to go to the police or to court
- Asking detailed questions that force them to relive painful  experiences
- Asking them to analyze what happened and why
- Pressuring them to reveal their feelings
- Blaming them for the violence

Disrespecting  their  agency  and  choice  These actions  can  do  more  harm  than  good. 2

## If a participant discloses using violence against someone else:

- Do not allow the group to make light of the issue or make jokes.
- Remember that in cases of disclosure of violence, it  is  essential  to  respect  confidentiality.  Ensure that  all  group  members  are  aware  that  what  is shared in the group should not leave the group, as  it  is  critical  to  guarantee  the  security  of  the victims.  All  disclosures  of  violence  should  be discussed with supervisors but never with members of the community. Any follow-up action should  be  decided  between  the  facilitators  and their supervisor. If the disclosure occurred within the group, ensure that everyone follows the rules of  confidentiality  and  respect.
- Remember  that  exceptions  to  the  principle  of confidentiality  apply  only  if  a  participant  reveals that they will harm another person or themselves or when someone's bodily integrity or life faces an immediate  risk.

## If a participant reveals their intent to harm another person:

1. Speak with your supervisor to determine whom to  contact  to  help  the  person  in  danger  and connect them to any available resources in the community  that  can  provide  support.
2. Make  a  connection:  Give  the  person  in  danger information about organizations (including SEED's  services  for  survivors)  where  they  can receive help. If the individual decides to go, call a contact in the organization (or speak with your colleague  in  advance)  to  let  them  know  that someone will be seeking support and ask them to  receive  the  person  warmly.
3. Inform  your  supervisor  immediately  after  the session so they can take any necessary action.

Men's groups should not be considered an appropriate  place  to  share  details  about  acts  of violence  against  women.  This  could  reinforce patriarchal  ideas  that  legitimize  violence.  In  such cases, the focus should be on how to manage anger and violence, on the harm that can be caused, on men taking responsibility for their actions, and on ensuring that potential survivors are not in danger.

## If a participant reports severe mental health issues:

If  a  participant  requires  specialist  support,  having disclosed suicidal thoughts or demonstrated severe depression during a session, acknowledge this disclosure in the moment and create a plan to talk individually  with  the  participant.  When  the  session ends, determine if they consent to being referred to SEED's mental health services and discuss the case with your supervisor. Remember that facilitators are not  the  participants'  counselors  or  therapists.

## KEY ACTIVITIES AND TIMING

1. Welcome and Pre-Test - 20 minutes
2. The Name Game - 15 minutes
3. Program Overview - 5 minutes
4. Group Agreement - 15 minutes
5. Act Like a Man, Act Like a Woman 45 minutes
6. Closing and Check-Out - 5 minutes

Total session time: 105 minutes

## MATERIALS

-  Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)
- A ball to throw for the Name Game
- Pre-test survey and pens/pencils for all participants

## PREPARATION

- Before the first group session, it is important that you as a facilitator understand the difference between a traditional teaching style (in which the teacher or facilitator is above the participants) and the group education facilitation style (in which the facilitator and group members are equals).
- Make sure that you have your materials together.
- Arrange the space so that it is inviting and equitable. There should be no desks or tables if possible, and chairs should be arranged in a circle. The facilitator's chair should be part of the circle. There can be a break in the circle to place the flipchart easel or to put flipchart papers on the wall.
- Make sure to review all the materials and that you are prepared for the discussion. As this is the first substantive discussion in the curriculum, and a foundational one, it is important that you feel prepared and comfortable facilitating the discussion. Think about some of the answers you would give to the questions, as well as answers that young people give that you might find challenging to respond to.

## PART 1: WELCOME AND PRE-TEST (20 MINUTES)

1. Warmly welcome participants to the group as they arrive and introduce yourself. If there are snacks or drinks available, encourage them to go ahead and take something.
2. Thank them for coming and record each person's name and information on the intake sheet/ attendance  log.
3. Once everyone has arrived (or enough time has passed), ask participants to sit down and thank them for their interest in participating.
4. Tell participants that before you start the program, they will take a survey in which they will be asked about some of their attitudes, beliefs, and practices.
5. Hand out the pre-test survey and have the participants complete it.

## PART 2: THE NAME GAME (15 MINUTES)

1. Explain that you would now like everyone to introduce themselves to the group. Ask participants to stand up and explain that you are going to play the Name Game.
2. Explain the first round and then play (demonstrating first if needed): In the first round, each person says their name before throwing the ball. So, one by one, each participant says their name and then throws the ball to someone else. This round ends when everyone has had a chance to say their name and has passed the ball back to the facilitator.
3. Repeat the game for the second round, but this time, after a participant says their name, they should put their hand on their head to signal that they have already gone. Continue the second round until everyone has spoken.

Facilitator Note: Use your own notebook or a piece of paper (not the flipchart) to write down the names of participants and any information about them after they introduce themselves. This will help you remember who they are and details about them more quickly.

## PART 3: PROGRAM OVERVIEW (5 MINUTES)

1. After each participant has introduced himself, tell the group: 'Over the next few months, we will meet twice per week for a total of ten meetings. Each session will have a different topic and will include interactive activities and group discussion. Some of the key things we will cover include…'
- 'What it means to be young men in our society today, some of the challenges you face, and your strengths you can use to overcome those challenges.'
- 'As people get older, especially in our teenage years, our bodies and minds change, and as a result, how we interact with other people changes, too. We will discuss what some of those changes are, how they affect us, and how we can improve our understanding of those changes so  they  are  not  as  disruptive  to  our  lives.  Some  that  we  will  discuss  include  expressing  our emotions, dealing with anger and conflict, and the effects of violence on our lives.'
- 'We will talk about and develop skills, especially around communication and conflict resolution, that will help us understand ourselves and our families better and help us interact with them better.'
- 'Finally,  we  will  talk  about  the  future.  As  young  people,  the  future  can  seem  very  far  away sometimes, and maybe even hopeless at times depending on the problems we face. But we will talk about what we want and need, what challenges we may face, and how to achieve our visions for a better life.'
2. Ask the group if they have any questions about the group sessions.

## PART 4: GROUP AGREEMENT (15 MINUTES)

1. Explain that the group will discuss many topics that are personal and potentially sensitive, such as family and friends, relationships, and violence. To discuss such issues, it is important to create a  safe,  respectful,  and  comfortable  space  for  members  of  the  group  to  talk  freely  about  such personal and sensitive subjects. Ask the group: 'What agreements would help you to feel safe and comfortable discussing and sharing in this group?'

Facilitator Note: You should write down the list of agreements on a flipchart paper. Remember that  these  need  to  be  visible  in  every  session.  The  following  box  lists  several  recommended agreements. If these are not mentioned first by the group members, recommend that they be included.

## IMPORTANT GROUP AGREEMENTS FOR A SUCCESSFUL GROUP

- Respect the right of others to have different opinions.*
- Let others finish speaking before you speak.*
- Maintain confidentiality. What is said in the group stays in the group.*
- Use 'put-ups,' not put-downs.
- Don't make jokes that are harmful or hurtful to others.
- Don't generalize about people.
- Talk about 'some' instead of 'all.'
- Use 'I' statements - own your opinions.
- Everyone should participate.
- All members of the group are equal.
- Commit to attending all the sessions and to being on time.

Make sure this is included in the final agreement..

2. After a list of agreements is created, ask: 'Is there anything missing that you would like to add?' Make any additions to the flipchart list that are suggested.
3. After the list is complete, ask each group member: 'Does everyone agree to this list and commit to upholding these agreements during our sessions?

Facilitator Note: If someone does not want to commit, ask them why. Ask the group: 'Are there alternative agreements that you would feel more comfortable with?' Suggest that the agreement be changed or removed, depending on the desires of the group.

4. Thank participants for their help in making the group safe, respectful, and comfortable. Explain that it is up to everyone in the group to maintain the group agreements. Ask that if they see their peers not upholding an agreement, they should remind them of the group agreements so the group can stay on track.
5. Read the Key Message: 'Creating group agreements will help everyone to feel comfortable, safe, and respected within this group. The agreements will remain in place for the duration of the group sessions. It is everyone's responsibility to follow them and encourage others to follow them.'

## PART 5: ACT LIKE A MAN, ACT LIKE A WOMAN (45 MINUTES)

1. Ask  the  participants  if  someone  has  ever  told  them  that  they  are  'acting  like  a  man'  or  that they should 'act like a man.' Ask them to tell the other participants about what happened when someone told them this  or  something  similar.
2. After a participant shares their story, ask: 'Why do you think this person told you so? What did you feel after?' Tell the participants: 'We will go deeper into these two questions. This will allow us to know how society makes it difficult to be male or female.'
3. Write on the flipchart paper with big letters the phrase 'Act Like a Man,' and ask the participants what this phrase means to them. What are society's expectations of what a man should be like and how he should behave? How should men feel and react?
4. After participants have given many answers (ideally 20 or more), draw a square box around the participants'  answers.

Facilitator Note: Some of the possible answers include 'be strong' and 'don't cry.' Answers to this question often relate to physical strength, repressing emotions (except anger), wielding power over oneself and others, having high status, and having accomplishments in areas like sports, making money, and professionally. You may need to remind participants that the list should focus on larger social messages about what it means to act like a man and not so much their personal opinion.

5. After you have finished the 'Act Like a Man' list, move to another flipchart paper and write the phrase 'Act Like a Woman.' Ask the participants what this phrase means to them and if they have heard it said to others. What are society's expectations of what a woman should be, how she should behave, and how she should react and feel?
6. After participants have given many answers (ideally 20 or more), draw a square box around the participants' answers.

Facilitator Note: Some of the possible answers include 'be a housewife' and 'don't be too aggressive.'  Answers  to  this  question  often  relate  to  physical  attractiveness,  displaying emotions, deferring to men, motherhood, humility, and acting in socially appropriate ways in terms of  not  displaying  sexuality.

7. After the participants are done with their suggestions, start the discussion using the Group Discussion  Questions:

Primary Questions:

- How does living and abiding by what's written in the box affect the well-being of men? How does it affect the well-being of women?
- Which of these statements - 'Act like a man' or 'Act like a woman' - is more harmful? Why?
- What  advantages  do  men  and  women  get  from  staying  inside  the  box?  Are  there  any disadvantages?

Additional Questions if time allows:

- How does living and abiding by what's written in the box limit and influence a man's life and relationships? How does what's written in the box influence and limit a woman's life?
- What happens to men who step outside of this box (i.e., living outside what is written in the box)?
-  What happens to women who step outside of the box and do not abide by gender roles? What do people say about them? How are they treated?
-  How do norms and expectations about honor affect how men and women behave?
- Can you think of examples of men and/or women in your life whom you admire who sometimes do not conform to the messages inside the box?
- What are some ways that you already do, or would like to, step outside of the confines of this box?
8. Read the Key Message to  the  group:  'The  aim  of  this  activity  is  to  help  clarify  how  society places different rules on how men and women are expected to behave. These rules are known as 'gender roles' because they dictate what is 'normal' for a man to think, feel, and behave and what is 'normal' for a woman. In many cases, these roles - as we will discuss in the coming sessions - might enforce additional limitations on men and women to maintain themselves inside  the  boxes  of  'act  like  a  man'  and  'act  like  a  woman, '  in  addition  to  the  consequences related to decision-making and private relations. These identities are based upon a set of beliefs communicated by parents, families, media, peers, and other members of society that place pressure on men to be a certain way.'

## PART 6: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing their questions, concerns, thoughts, and expectations.
2. Express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
3. Explain that you will use all questions posed and expectations shared to further inform and shape the coming sessions.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Explain that the session is ending and that each meeting will end with a 'check-out,' during which participants will have an opportunity to reflect on what has been discussed.
6. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any final questions?
- Are you looking forward to our future meetings?
7. After addressing the questions, confirm the time, date, and place of the next session

If they do not have or do not know their father, ask them to think about any important male figure in their life, such as a grandfather, uncle, older brother, or teacher.

<!-- image -->

## PREPARATION

- Think about your relationship with your father or male caregiver(s). How would you answer the questions you will be posing in this activity? If you are a parent, how has being a parent changed how you think about your father/caregiver(s) and your experience as a child? Be prepared to share some of these with the participants.
- Prepare a flipchart sheet with the following statements and cover it until indicated in the session:
- One thing that my father does that makes me feel loved and cared for is…
- One thing my father does with me that I don't like or makes me unhappy is…

2. Tell the group to spend a minute thinking about the time they spend with this man. What about those times do they enjoy and why?
3. After two minutes, tell everyone to open their eyes. Ask for volunteers to share briefly about the time they spend with their father or male caregiver.
4. As each person shares their story, thank them for having the emotional strength to share with the group. Once everyone who wants to has finished sharing, thank them once again for the trust participants have in the group.

13.  Then, lead a discussion with the following Group Discussion Questions:
- What are the positive things about your relationship with your parents that you value? Why are those things important to you?
- In a lot of households, we hear things like, 'Men should not cry' and 'Men should raise sons to be tough.' How do you think this affects our fathers? How do you think it affects the way they cared for us?
- How do you think these beliefs affected our mothers?
- How is your life today different than your parents' lives when they were your age? What are some challenges they faced that you do not? What are some challenges that you face that they did not and may have trouble understanding?
14. Read the Key Messages:
- 'Who we are today was shaped by our experiences growing up, both positive and negative. They can, but do not have to, determine who we will become in the future. Reflecting on our own past enables us to make positive choices for the future by replacing negative attitudes and behaviors with positive ones.'

- 'When you're having unpleasant experiences - such as violence, bullying, or other problems young people deal with - it's important to talk to your parents about it or reach out to other adults who can help you. There are more adults who want to, and can, help you than you may realize.'

## PART 3: MINDFULNESS ACTIVITY: DRAWING WHAT YOU FEEL (5 MINUTES)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Drawing What You Feel.  During  this  exercise,  you'll  try  to  channel  your  emotions  into  a  short  drawing activity.
2. Have each person pull out a piece of paper and a pen (or hand them out).
3. Tell the participants to take 30 seconds to do some deep breathing exercises and concentrate on how they are feeling.
4. Have the participants take the next three or four minutes to draw something that reflects how they are feeling now on their pieces of paper. This doesn't need to be a fancy or well-drawn picture

## PART 4: WEEKLY COMMITMENT (5 MINUTES)

1. Explain the Weekly Commitment : 'In the coming week, find a few moments to speak with one or both of your parents about how they parent you, if you are comfortable doing so. You might thank them for an aspect of their parenting that you enjoy and is meaningful to you. Or you might ask them questions about what they enjoy about being a parent or even what they find challenging about parenting.'

## PART 5:

## CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

Adapt this set of characters to reflect the realities of oppressive  'power  over'  systems  in  your  context.

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:
-  How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
3. Ask participants about last week's commitment: 'Did anyone do one thing that is outside of the gender box that they have not done before or do not usually do? How did it feel to do this?'
4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## PART 2: : WHO'S POWERFUL? (30 MINUTES)

- What does power mean for a family? In your community?
- How do you feel when you have power? How do you feel when you don't have power?
2. Introduce the activity of 'who has the power?' . You will read a scenario and the participants need to tell you who they think is more powerful in that situation and why. (Facilitator Note: You can also probe questions like How would this make these people feel? What would you do if you were in the position of less power? What would you advise the powerful person to do in this scenario?)
- A father tells his 14-year-old daughter that she will have to stop going to school because he has found someone for her to marry.

- How can we improve some of these situations?
4. Recap the definition of power and the importance of power balance in relationships.

## PART 3: POWER WALK (30 MINUTES)

Facilitator  Note: Though the activity is brief,  taking  on  the  role  of  some  of  these  characters can  be  an  emotional  experience,  especially  for  those  characters  who  experience  the  most oppression. Be aware of how people react emotionally to the activity. Remind participants that they can choose to step out of the activity at any point. When you ask participants to hand in their character cards at the end, encourage them to remind themselves that they are now back in the group and are no longer 'in character.' As facilitators, please use your best judgement on whether this activity would resonate with your group. For younger boys, this may not be as applicable, and you will want to continue to expand on Part 2 of this session and concentrate on interpersonal power dynamics in the home, friendships, and community.

1. Introduce the activity by explaining to participants that this activity, called the Power Walk, will look at how gender, race, ethnicity, and other factors influence how much power people have in society and how power can be used to restrict some people's progress in life.
2. Ask the participants to stand in a row. Have each pick one of the character cards that you prepared earlier from a box, bag, or hat.
3. Ask each participant to read aloud the role they picked. Explain that you want them to take on the characters that have been written on the cards.
4. Ask the participants to close their eyes and think about what it would be like to be the character they have been given. What would that character's day look like? After a minute, ask them to open their eyes.

5. Tell them that you will read a series of statements. For each statement, you would like them to consider whether that statement applies to their character. If it does, they should move forward one step. If it doesn't, they should stay where they are.
6. Remind participants to speak up and ask for help from the rest of the group if they are unsure how a particular statement applies to their character.
7. Read the following statements one at a time and ask participants to silently move forward one step if the statement applies to them. You do not have to go through all the statements, just as many as you can. (Start from the top and move down until you reach the end.)
- I have had or will have opportunities to complete my education.
- I don't have to worry about where my next meal will come from.
- I can earn enough money to make a good life for myself and my children.
- I could find a new job easily.
- I can go to the police and not be worried about being threatened with arrest or violence.
- I can determine when and how many children I will have.
- If I have a health problem, I can get the help I need right away.
- I can leave my partner if he or she threatens my safety.
- I can travel around my area easily.
- I can decide when and whom I want to marry without fear.
- If I have a crime committed against me, the police will listen to my case.
- I can walk down a street at night and not worry about being raped or murdered.
-  I am respected by most members of my community.
- I can afford to meet my basic needs.
- I can choose whom I want to spend my time with or go out with.
- I can choose when I want to leave the house and socialize, and I have places to go to socialize that are comfortable and safe for me.
8. When you finish with all the statements, ask the participants to read their roles out loud again.
9. Ask the participants to no longer play their character but remain where they are standing, and discuss  the  activity  using  the  following Group Discussion Questions:
- If you did not move or moved very little, how does it feel to see where the others are standing? Does it feel right to be so far behind the others? Who or what is to blame for your position?
- If you moved a lot, how does it feel to be ahead of many of the others? Does it feel right to be so far ahead? Why are you so far ahead?
10.  Ask participants to sit back down in a circle and hand in their character cards.
11.  Tell participants that differences based on gender, age, sexuality, or other reasons often relate to power and privilege. Some people who feel powerless can also have power over others depending on the situation. Proceed to the following Group Discussion Questions:
- How does one's race or ethnicity impact how much power he or she may have? How does your gender impact how much power you have?
- What would a world look like  in  which  everyone  is  standing  closer  together  or  even  in  one straight line - where power is more equally distributed among members of society? What are some advantages of  that  scenario?
- How can this activity help you think about and perhaps make changes in your own lives? In your relationships? In society?

12.  Direct participants to Journal Resource Page 3.1 ('Understanding Power') so participants can read more about different types of power at home.
13.  Read the Key Messages:
- Power has many different faces and meanings. In this activity, we looked at the different ways people have power over others.
- Many people can be impacted in multiple ways by 'power over' systems. For example, a young, unemployed  Black  woman  is  impacted  by  the  effects  of  racism,  sexism,  and  poverty.  Most people have some experiences of privilege in their lives and some experiences of oppression.
- We have many identities (such as man or woman; young or old; and Kurdish, Iraqi, or Syrian); some of these identities can give us more power or privilege than others depending on the situation. Men are privileged by patriarchy - a system in which men on the whole have power over women. But there are limits to these privileges. For example, the privilege of the male member of the Kurdistan Parliament is greater than that of the physically disabled male veteran.
- As we talked about in the 'Act Like a Man, Act Like a Woman' activity, it is important to find ways to break out of these 'power over' systems and support others who are trying to do the same.

## PART 4: MINDFULNESS ACTIVITY: SENSES (5 MINUTES)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Senses. During this activity, you will be giving them a raisin (or other candy) and guiding them through their senses while giving the object all their attention.
2. Give the participants a raisin (or other candy)
3. Read the script:

Holding: First, take a raisin and hold it in the palm of your hand or between your finger and thumb.

[(If in a wrapper) Hearing: Unwrap the candy and listen very carefully to the sounds it makes as you take it off. Try to block out all of the other sounds you may be hearing in the room.]

Seeing: Take time to really focus on it; gaze at the raisin with care and full attention-imagine that you've just dropped in from Mars and have never seen an object like this before in your life. Let your eyes explore every part of it, examining the highlights where the light shines, the darker hollows, the folds and ridges, and any asymmetries or unique features.

Touching: Turn the raisin over between your fingers, exploring its texture. Maybe do this with your eyes closed if that enhances your sense of touch.

Smelling: Hold  the  raisin  beneath  your  nose.  With  each  inhalation,  take  in  any  smell,  aroma,  or fragrance that may arise. As you do this, notice anything interesting that may be happening in your mouth  or  stomach.

Placing: Now slowly bring the raisin up to your lips, noticing how your hand and arm know exactly how and where to position it. Gently place the raisin in your mouth; without chewing, noticing how it gets into your mouth in the first place. Spend a few moments focusing on the sensations of having it in your mouth, exploring it with your tongue.

Tasting: When you are ready, prepare to chew the raisin, noticing how and where it needs to be for chewing. Then, very consciously, take one or two bites into it and notice what happens in the aftermath, experiencing any waves of taste that emanate from it as you continue chewing. Without swallowing yet, notice the bare sensations of taste and texture in your mouth and how these may change over time, moment by moment. Also pay attention to any changes in the object itself.

Swallowing: When you feel ready to swallow the raisin, see if you can first detect the intention to swallow as it  comes  up,  so  that  even  this  is  experienced  consciously  before  you  actually  swallow the raisin.

Following: Finally, see if you can feel what is left of the raisin moving down into your stomach, and sense how your body as a whole is feeling after you have completed this exercise.

Script by Greater Good in Action: https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/raisin\_meditation

## PART 5: WEEKLY COMMITMENT (5 MINUTES)

1. Tell the participants the Weekly Commitment: 'During the next week, think about what power you have and how you can share it with others. When you have an opportunity, try and share power. Think about how it affects your interaction with other people and how it makes you feel.'

## PART 6: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

## PREPARATION

- Before  the  session,  think  about  what  information  is  largely  known/accepted  by  the  local community regarding violence, taking into consideration the current laws and aid available for people who use violence or are victims of it. Coordinate with your supervisor on what the proper response is to discovering that a participant might require a referral because you learn they are suffering from violence or abuse.
- On the flipchart, write the types of violence and their definitions that will be discussed in the activity. Cover these definitions with another piece of paper so the participants do not see them until you show them later.
- There are many case studies provided, but you will only use three or four in the activity. Read them all beforehand and select those that seem most appropriate for your group based on their cultural context, maturity, knowledge, etc.

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:
-  How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
3. Ask  about  last  week's  commitment:  'Did  anyone  find  new  opportunities  to  share  power  with others in the last week? How did it affect your interaction with others? How did it make you feel?'
4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.
- Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)
- A  copy  of  each  of  the  case  studies  in Facilitator  Resource  Page  4.1  ('Violence Case Studies'), located at the end of this session

## PART 2: WHAT IS VIOLENCE? (60 MINUTES)

1. Ask the group: 'What is violence? What is an example of violence you know?' Allow them to share their opinions, writing down the participants' responses on a flipchart paper. If participants identify general types of violence, such as 'physical,' ask them for specific examples of this.
2. After everyone has shared, explain to the group: 'At its simplest level, violence is the way for one individual to have control or power over another. Violence is not a random act. It happens in specific circumstances and settings. Violence happens more frequently in some settings than others, such as during periods of conflict, but it is also very present in our homes and communities. Violence often occurs within the family and is often perpetrated by men against women and by parents against children, although these are not the only types of violence.'
3. Tell  the  group  that  acts  of  violence  can  be  divided  into  several  broad  categories.  Unveil  the definitions  of  violence  to  the  group:
- Physical violence: Using physical force, such as hitting, beating, slapping, kicking, burning, or pushing.
- Emotional  or  psychological  violence: Often  the  most  difficult  form  of  violence  to  identify. It  may  include  humiliating,  threatening,  insulting,  pressuring,  and  expressing  jealousy  or possessiveness,  such  as  controlling  decisions  and  activities.  It  can  also  include  restricting someone's  movements.  This  form  of  violence  can  be  verbal  or  nonverbal.
- Sexual violence: Pressuring or forcing someone to perform sexual acts (from kissing to sex) against their will or making sexual comments that make someone feel humiliated or uncomfortable. It does not matter if the person has previously consented to sexual behavior - consent must be given at the time.
- Social or economic violence: When someone else exercises complete or partial control over a person's money and other economic and social resources. This type of violence is a way of exerting power and can be used to control someone's movement: for example, keeping them from meeting friends, limiting access to school, or denying access to resources or opportunities.
4. Select and read three or four of the case studies on Facilitator Resource Page 4.1 ('Violence Case Studies') and discuss the questions specific to each case study with the group. Remind the group of the definitions of violence.
5. After  reading  and  discussing  some  of  the  case  studies,  ask  the  following Group  Discussion Questions:
-  What are the kinds of violence that occur in relationships between men and women? What causes this violence? (Examples can include physical, emotional, or sexual violence that a man exercises against a friend/girlfriend/wife, in addition to violence used by a woman against her friend/partner.)
- What are the types of violence common within the family? What causes this violence? (Examples may include physical/emotional/sexual violence used by the parents against their children or other forms among family members.)
- What  are  the  types  of  violence  that  occur  outside  the  boundaries  of  family  or  romantic relationships? What causes this violence? (Examples may include physical violence among men related to war, religiously based violence [such as by ISIS], violence in the community, rape, emotional  violence,  and  stigma  against  some  individuals  or  groups  in  the  community.)
- Are there types of violence that relate to a person's gender? What kinds of violence are used against  women?
- Are there types of violence that relate to a person's ethnicity/religion or nationality status? What types?

Facilitator Note: If participants do not mention it, the facilitator should be sure to bring up honor killings as a form of violence used primarily by men against women.

-  Are only men violent, or can women be violent as well? What is the most common type of violence  men  use  against  others?  What  is  the  most  common  type  of  violence  women  use against  others?
- Does any man or woman ever 'deserve' to be beaten or to suffer from violence?
- What are the negative outcomes of using violence on girls? Boys? What are the impacts on families?  Communities?
- What are some actions you can take to protect yourself or others from violence? (Examples include saying 'no' even if you know the person, running away from the violent situation, telling a trusted adult, and shouting loudly for help.)
6. Read the Key Messages:
- 'At its most basic level, violence is a way to control or have power over another person. People often only think about violence as physical aggression, but there are other forms of violence as well. Most often, this violence is targeted toward individuals or groups that are more vulnerable or marginalized in our communities.'
- 'Violence is a violation of a person's human rights, whether it is enacted against women, men, or children. According to official data and statistics at the global, regional, and national levels, women are disproportionately affected by intimate partner violence, while the perpetrators of this type of violence as well as other types of crimes and violence (such as murder and sexual violence outside the home) are overwhelmingly men.'
- 'It is widely assumed that violence is a 'normal' and 'natural' part of being a man. Yet violence is a learned behavior and not innate. Thus, it can be eliminated. As we discussed in other sessions, men are mostly brought up to suppress their emotions, with anger being the sole emotion they can express without affecting their masculine image. Additionally, sometimes men are raised to believe that they have the right to expect certain things from women and that they have the right to abuse women physically and verbally if they do not comply with the men's expectations.'

## PART 3: MINDFULNESS ACTIVITY: AFFIRMATIONS (5 MINUTES)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Affirmations. During this activity, you will have them close their eyes and think about what they are thankful for.
2. Ask the participants to close their eyes and say: 'Think of one thing you are thankful for today. What makes you thankful for it? Whom do you have to be thankful to?' Give them 30 seconds to think.
3. Have them open their eyes and write what they are thankful for on a small piece of paper (or index card) without their name.
4. Collect these papers in a hat or bucket and read them aloud to the group.
5. Thank the group for their vulnerability and sharing what they are thankful for.

## PART 4: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?

3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

## FACILITATOR RESOURCE PAGE 4.1: VIOLENCE CASE STUDIES

Several case studies are available to use with participants. Please read through each before the training and choose case studies that you feel will be the most relevant and sensitive to the community in which you are working.

The case studies include several scenarios of  sexual,  physical,  and  emotional  violence  used  by  men against women in intimate relationships; men using physical violence against women outside of intimate relationships;  physical  violence  between  men;  and  community  and  institutional  violence  against individuals  or  a  group  of  individuals.  When  necessary,  you  can  adjust  these  case  studies  to  address other types of violence that may occur within couples, families, and the local community. One additional suggestion could be a scenario that involves online violence, if appropriate.

CASE STUDY #1: Ziad  and  Lydia  are  married.  One  day,  Ziad's  family  is  coming  for  dinner.  He  is  very nervous, wondering if his family members will have a good time, and he wants to show them how good a cook his wife is. Yet when he returns home that night, his wife hasn't prepared any food since she was feeling sick and couldn't start preparing dinner. Ziad is very angry, as he doesn't want his family to think that he cannot control his wife. They start arguing and yelling. The conflict intensifies quickly, and Ziad starts calling Lydia names, insulting her, and threatening to divorce her.

- What kind of violence is this?
- How should Lydia react/respond?
- Could Ziad act differently in this case?
- How could Ziad's family respond? How would you respond?

CASE STUDY #2: You are hanging out after school with a group of friends when you see a couple arguing. The man calls the woman a whore and asks why she looked at another man. She answers, 'I was not looking at him, and even if I did, aren't I with you?' The man yells at her again, and she answers: 'You don't have the right to treat me like that.' He calls her 'worthless' and asks her to leave his sight, as he can't look at her anymore. Then, he hits her, and she falls to the ground. She yells at him, saying that it's not his right to act that way.

- What kind of violence is this?
- What would you do? Would you leave? Would you say something? Why or why not?
- Would the situation be different if a man were hitting another man?
- What could you do in such cases? What are your options?
- Is it your responsibility to stop others from using violence?

CASE STUDY #3: A group of friends is going to the park. Fady notices another guy looking at his fiancée. Fady gets up and walks toward that guy and punches him, and they start fighting.

- What kind of violence is this?
- Why did Fady act this way?
- Do you think Fady was right to fight this other guy?
- How could or should he have reacted or responded?
- What should his friends do?

CASE STUDY #4: Aveen recently left her family to get married to a man without her father's approval. Her family was angry about it and told her she is dishonoring their family. One night on her way home, she is murdered by her brother and her cousin.

- What kind of violence is this?
- Do you think this treatment is a kind of violence? Why or why not?
- How does society justify this kind of violence?
- How are norms about honor harmful to women? How are they harmful to men?
- What would you do in such a scenario if you were part of Aveen's family?
- How are situations like this usually handled, and what would be a better way to handle them?

CASE STUDY #5: Sami is a guy from a wealthy family. One day, he meets a girl named Laila as she is on her way from school to her house, and they have a conversation. The next day, he meets her again, and he keeps seeing her until one day, he asks her out to a restaurant. During dinner, Sami tells Laila how much he admires her and asks her to go with him to walk in the park. When they are walking in the park, they sit on a bench and start kissing. Then, Sami starts feeling Laila's body under her shirt. Laila stops him and says that she doesn't want him to go any further. Sami feels very angry and tells her that he spent a lot of time on her, saying, 'What will my friends say about me?' He insists that she change her mind. At first, he tries tempting her, and then he starts yelling, expressing his disappointment, but she does not consent.

- Do you think this is a kind of violence? Why or why not?
- What should have Sami done?
- What could have Laila done?

CASE STUDY #6: Noha is a 15-year-old girl who lives with her parents and siblings. One day, her father comes home and says he has found a husband for her and that she will get married in a few months. Noha begins to cry because she wants to continue going to school and she doesn't want to marry someone she has never even met.

- Do you think this is a kind of violence? Why or why not?
- Why might Noha's father have decided to do this?
- Is there something anyone else in the family could do? What should they do in this situation?
- What could Noha do?
- What might be the disadvantages of Noha getting married at this age? What could be some benefits of getting married at an older age?
- What could be some benefits of Noha having input into whom she marries?

Facilitator Note: Please be sure to include some information about the applicable laws regarding early marriage in this scenario.

CASE STUDY #7: Rami and Nada are a couple with two children. When they decided to have children, they  agreed  that  Nada  would  be  the  one  staying  home  and  taking  care  of  the  children  while  Rami worked to bring in money. However, now that the children are old enough to go to school, Nada wants to go back to work part time, but Rami wants her to stay home. They discuss this, but the situation is not resolved. Rami starts giving Nada less money, and soon, she does not have enough money to buy clothes for herself or even meet her friends for coffee. Every day when he comes home, Rami asks her lots of questions about where she went and whom she was with during the day.

- Is this considered a kind of violence? Why or why not?
- What should Nada do, in your opinion?
- Could Rami have acted differently?
- Imagine yourself in this situation. What would you do if this were happening inside your family?

CASE STUDY #8: Tarek is 15 years old and is having a tough day at school. His parents had punished him because of his bad grades and said he could not play football that afternoon. In class, he was unable to answer a teacher's question. Now, after school, his classmate Rana is mocking him for failing to answer the teacher's easy question. She says, 'The question was very easy. Are you really that stupid?' Tarek tells her to shut up and pushes her against the wall. Rana rages with anger and says, 'If you touch me again, I'll show you what I'll do to you!' Tarek replies: 'No, you wait and see what I'll do to you.' He slaps her, turns around, and walks away.

- Do you think Tarek was right to hit Rana?
- Could he have acted in another way?
- What could or should Rana do?
- Would it feel different if it were a boy who said this instead of a girl?
- What type of violence was this?

<!-- image -->

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:
-  How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
3. Ask about last week's commitment: 'Did anyone have a chance to speak with one of your parents about the experience of parenting? How did that conversation go?'
4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## PART 2: TYPES OF EMOTIONS (10 MINUTES)

1. Tape Emoji signs around the room on the wall. Introduce the topic to the youth that today's session will concentrate on emotions. First, we are going to learn about different types of emotions that we feel as humans.
2. Have all students stand up. With the Emoji signs on the wall, read the corresponding name of the emotion and have them identify which is the most relevant Emoji and go stand by that sign. Continue until all are completed.
3. Ask if they have any questions and then emphasize that there are many emotions that we can be feeling - and most times we are feeling multiple at once.
4. Explain For the remainder of the session, you all will concentrate on some emotions we might feel when we are experiencing or using violence so they should keep some of these in their mind.

## PART 3: EMPATHY CLOTHESLINE (45 MINUTES)

## Facilitator Note:

- While it is  critical  with  every  session to remind young men about the limits of confidentiality and to review the ground rules, this activity asks young men to think more deeply about their exposure to violence and violence they may have perpetrated. Young men should be reminded that the discussion is anonymous; they should not put their name on the pieces of paper. Remind young men that they do not need to disclose anything.
- When we talk  about  abuse,  violence,  and  hurting  people,  we  tend  to  only  think  of  physical aggression, but it is important to also think about other forms of violence. Make sure to remind participants about the other forms of violence that were discussed in earlier sessions. It is also essential to help young men think about the acts of violence that they perpetrate because very often, we think others are violent but never ourselves.
- If  possible, facilitation  should  be  done  with  someone  who  has  been  trained  in  supporting survivors so that young men have an identified person to talk to if they would like. The content of this activity is very sensitive, and the young men may not feel comfortable during the discussion. They should be allowed to excuse themselves if they wish. All young men should be given - and reminded how to use - resources relevant to interpersonal violence at the end of the session, with physical copies of those resources handed out to them.

1. Explain that the activity today will continue earlier discussions about violence and how it affects us, our families, and our communities and society.
2. After the four clotheslines are set up, give four small pieces of paper or notecards to each participant.
3. Ask each participant to think for a while about things they may have seen or heard and to write a  short  response  to  each  of  the  two  categories  on  the  clotheslines.  You  can  give  examples  if participants are struggling to think of some. Each person should write at least one reply for each clothesline (or category). Allow about ten minutes for this task. Explain that they should not write much, just a few words or a phrase. Remind them not to put their names on the cards. If the group doesn't have high literacy levels, they can draw their responses, but it is preferred that they write.
4. Ask the participants to place their cards face down on a table at the front of the room, with one stack for each of the four categories. Shuffle the cards and begin to place them on the different clotheslines.
5. After all replies are on the clotheslines, allow the group to walk around and read all the responses. Then, ask the following Group Discussion Questions:
-  What are the most common types of ways we hurt one another?
- How do we feel when someone uses violence against us?
- How do we feel when we use violence against other people?
- What does it feel like when we've been hurt by someone with whom we are in a close or intimate relationship  (like  family,  friends,  or  significant  others)?  How  is  this  different  than  if  it  were someone with whom we were just friends?
- How does the media (music, radio, movies, pornography, etc.) portray some of the violence we've  talked  about?
- Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, 'Returning violence for violence multiplies violence….Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.' This quote illustrates that the use of violence is like a cycle, and it is our duty to interrupt this cycle of violence. What do you think about this? Where might we see cycles of violence occurring? (In our community? In our neighborhood?)
- What role do you think you could play in preventing cycles of violence?
- What are ways to heal the pain or harm caused by violence - not so much the physical pain, but the emotional harm? What can you do to help someone who has been hurt? How does it feel to help others?
- What have you learned in this activity to help overcome violence?
6. After you have asked the discussion questions, ask the group what it was like for them to talk about violence and abuse they may have seen, heard, or experienced.
7. If  anyone  in  the  group  shows  a  need  for  special  attention  due  to  something  said  during  the discussion, ensure you as the facilitator bring the young person to meet with one of the site leads (at the agency where the program is being held). Ensure the young person knows where to get help, consider referring them to appropriate services, and discuss the issue with other senior staff at your organization (see the introduction section at the beginning of the curriculum). Facilitators should adhere to mandatory reporting requirements as specified by their agency or organization.
8. Read the Key Messages:
- 'There are many ways that people can be hurtful toward others. This can include physical as well as verbal and emotional ways of hurting each other. Hurting others in these ways is a form of violence.'
- 'Violence is often passed from person to person. Someone who has been hurt is more likely to hurt others later because of the pain they feel. This does not mean that violence will definitely take place, but just that it might. Recognizing the hurt and finding support for pain are some of the ways to stop this from happening.'
- 'We have the opportunity here to break the cycle of violence that we experience and to prevent that cycle from passing on to others.'

## PART 4: ENERGIZER (2 MINUTES)

1. Select a short energizer from the list in Appendix A and conduct it with participants.

## PART 5: WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I'M ANGRY? (30 MINUTES)

1. Remind participants that a few weeks ago, you talked about violence and its negative impacts. Say that in this activity, they will talk about emotions and their connections with violence.
2. Ask participants:
- How do you know when you are sad (e.g., my energy feels low, I don't feel like going outside)?
- How do you know when you are happy (e.g., I am smiling, I feel like I can do anything)?
3. Explain: 'As you turn into adults, feeling moody or depressed one moment and happy the next is normal. However, this does not mean that your emotions have complete control over you. One emotion that often feels like it takes control of us is anger. Anger is a natural and normal emotion that every human being feels at some point in life. However, many people confuse anger with violence. Violence is a behavior, one way that some people express anger. But there are many other ways to express anger - more positive ways - than violence. It is important to learn how to express our anger rather than bottling it up inside us. When we allow anger to build up, we tend to explode. Additionally, healthier ways of expressing anger can lead to better results.'
4. Explain to the group that you will now talk about how to react to anger.
5. Ask participants to relax and close their eyes. Say: 'Think of a situation when you were angry. It could be with a parent or with a friend. What happened? Don't say it out loud. Just think about it.' Give them a few minutes to think silently.

Optional Step: Refer participants to Journal Resource Page 5.1 ('What Do I Do When I Am Angry?') and pass out pens or pencils to everyone in the group. Ask that they write one or two sentences about a situation in which they felt angry.

6. Next, say: 'In this situation, try to remember what you were thinking and feeling.'

Optional Step: Alternatively, they can write down one or two feelings they felt when they were angry.

7. Explain: 'Very often, after we feel angry, we begin to react with violence. This can happen before we even realize that we are angry. Some men and women react immediately: shouting, throwing something  on  the  floor,  hitting  something  or  someone.  Sometimes,  we  can  even  become depressed and silent. Think about the incident when you felt angry. How did you demonstrate this anger? How did you behave?'
2. Optional Step: They can write a sentence or a few words about how they reacted.
8. Divide participants into groups of four or five people each at the most. Ask them to share what they wrote or thought about in the group. Allow ten minutes for the group sharing.
9. Ask each group to brainstorm realistic and positive ways of reacting when we are angry with a parent, sibling, or friend. Give them ten minutes to brainstorm.
10.  Ask each group to present their answers.
11.  Use the box 'Positive Ways to React When I Am Angry' to give additional suggestions on how to resolve conflicts when we are angry.

## 12.  Ask the following Group Discussion Questions:

- Are there any people in your life you can look to as role models to learn about how we express our emotions like anger in healthy ways?
- We generally know how to avoid a conflict or a fight without using violence. Why don't we apply that knowledge more often?

## POSITIVE WAYS TO REACT WHEN I AM ANGRY

## Get Help From Others

Ask someone or a small group of people you trust to listen to the reasons you are angry and help come up with solutions to deal with these difficult emotions.

## Take a Breath of Fresh Air

To take a breath of fresh air is simply getting out of the situation of conflict and away from the person who is making you angry. You can count to ten, breathe deeply, take a walk, or do some kind of physical activity, trying to cool down and stay calm. You should also explain to the other person that you will go outside to get some fresh air because you are feeling angry. For example, 'I'm really angry, and I need to get some fresh air. I need to do something like go for a walk so I don't feel violent or start shouting. When I've cooled down, we can talk things over.'

## Use Words Without Offending

To use words without offending is to learn how to express two things: to say to the other person why you are upset, and to say what you want from the other person without offending or insulting. For example, 'I am angry with you because…' and 'I would like you to…'

13.  Read the Key Message: ' Anger is a natural emotion that everybody experiences throughout their lives. The problem is when some people mix anger and violence together and consider them the same concept, thinking that violence is an acceptable way to express anger. Yet there are other better and more positive ways to express anger. Learning to express our anger is considered better than bottling up our anger inside and not expressing it because if our anger accumulates, it will result in an eruption of anger at a later stage.'

## PART 6: MINDFULNESS ACTIVITY: SELF-MASSAGE (5 MINUTES)

1. Tell  the  participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Self-Massage.
2. Ask the participants  to  bring  their  hands  together  and  use  one  thumb  to  rub  the  other  hand. Continue  this  for  30  seconds  and  then  have  them  switch  hands.
3. Then, have them bring their hands to their shoulders and rub their shoulders to relieve some of the tension. Continue this for 30 seconds.
4. Bring their attention to their necks. Have them bring their hands to the back of their necks and rub in a circular motion for 30 seconds.
5. Lastly, have them bring their hands to the sides of their heads by their foreheads (temples). Have them gently rub in a circular motion for 30 seconds.
6. Have them take three long, deep breaths.

## PART 7: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.

Facilitator Note: You can also have participants write their own situations; in that case, bring at least two small pieces of paper for each participant and enough pens/pencils for the group. However, bring these written-out situations regardless to add to participants' examples if needed.

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:
-  How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
3. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## PART 2: HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS (45 MINUTES)

## Section 1

1. Ask the participants to think about their friends and brainstorm 'what characteristics they look for in a friend (if an older group, you could say friend and/or wife)'? Write these on a flipchart.
2. Express the importance of finding friends that you get along with and treat you well. Introduce the idea of healthy and unhealthy relationships.
3. On a flipchart paper in front of the group, write 'Healthy' on the left side and 'Unhealthy' on the right.
4. Explain: 'These are two types of relationships that will be explored today. When I say 'relationships,' I do not mean only romantic relationships but any kind of interaction between two people. Other examples of relationships include friends, parents and children, siblings, teachers and students, neighbors, and many others. As you think about what makes a relationship healthy or unhealthy, you should think about how you like or do not like to be treated by other people. That can help you think about what kinds of actions are healthy or unhealthy.'
5. Ask the group to define healthy and unhealthy relationships by brainstorming words under each of the two categories that help describe them. Your flipchart may look like this:
6. Place the list of healthy and unhealthy characteristics aside and be prepared to revisit it later in the activity.

| HEALTHY       | UNHEALTHY                    |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| Honesty       | Lying                        |
| Communication | Poor communication           |
| Equality      | Domination                   |
| Respect       | Being dismissive, belittling |
| Trust Care    | Mistrust                     |

## Section 2

7. Explain that participants are going to look further into what a healthy or unhealthy relationship is. At the top of a large wall or chalkboard, place the three relationship cards so that they are spread out, with 'Healthy' on the left, 'Depends' in the middle, and 'Unhealthy' on the right.
8. Hand out two notecards to each participant. Tell them to write down a healthy scenario on one card and an unhealthy scenario on the other. (These can be made up, something they've seen or heard, or something that happened to them.)

## OR

Take out the 'Relationship Situations' cards mentioned in the preparation section of this activity. Tell participants that these are examples, and they can imagine themselves in that situation in the future or think about people they know being in that situation.

Collect the cards, mix them up, and hand them out randomly to participants.

9. Tell the participants to place the cards in the column they think the situation should be in: 'Healthy,' 'Depends,' or 'Unhealthy.' (If participants have written their own examples and you do not have enough scenarios or variety, you should then hand out the example situations you have written up before the session.)
10.  After all the scenarios have been placed, ask the group what they think about the placements. Review each situation one by one, allowing time for discussion. If participants don't agree, remind them of the qualities of a healthy relationship (communication, respect, equality, responsibility, and  honesty).  Ask  them  if  the  situation  shows  these  qualities  and  move  the  situation  to  the appropriate  column.
11.  After concluding, move on to the Group Discussion Questions:
- What, to you, are the most important things in a relationship? Is this different for everyone?
- What are some challenges or barriers to being able to build the type of relationship we want with others?
- What role does trust play? How do we build that?
- What happens when we feel like we can't trust someone else?
- What are ways to build better communication? What is our role in doing that?
- How do we deal with a relationship that we don't find healthy? Why would someone stay in a relationship that is unhealthy?

## 12.  Read the Key Messages:

- 'Healthy relationships are based on communication, honesty, equality, mutual respect, care, and responsibility. By practicing those things, and asking others to do the same with us, we can build not only better relationships but also better communities.'
- 'Being  in  a  healthy  relationship  can  provide  you  with  support  and  happiness.  Unhealthy relationships can lead to a variety of problems and difficulties in life, so it is important to try and  change  them  if  that  is  possible.  You  can  seek  help  from  family,  friends,  or  community organizations  to  help  you  find  solutions.'

## PART 3:

## MINDFULNESS ACTIVITY: SHAKE IT OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Tell  the  participants  that  you  will  be  leading  them  through  a  mindfulness  activity  called  Shake it  Out. This is a good exercise to do when you're feeling stressed, and it helps release built-up emotions.
2. Ask everyone to stand (if they can; otherwise, it is OK to do this exercise in a chair or seated position, too!) Explain that you will be calling out a body part that the group will need to shake out however they want to. Each body part is going to get ten seconds of shaking, and then you'll move on to the next one.
3. Read the following script:
- 'Start with your feet. Shake your left foot! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Next, your right foot! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Now, move that shake up the whole of your left leg! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Next, your right leg! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Now, shake out your right arm! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Then, your left arm! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'
- 'Now, move that shaking feeling up and down the whole of your body! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Stop.'
4. Get everyone to stop, take a deep breath, and let their breathing return to normal.
5. Thank everyone for their participation. Remind them that they can do this at home at any point they have feelings that they want to get out of their system.

## PART 4: WEEKLY COMMITMENT (5 MINUTES)

1. Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'Think about your interpersonal relationships, whether it is with family, friends, classmates, neighbors, or someone else. Are there any that you would like to make healthier? Think about how you can do that and try one of the approaches. Also, if you have a relationship that you think is very healthy and you value, let that person know and thank them for the role they play in your life.'

## PART 5: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

2. Thank all participants for sharing today.
3. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
4. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
5. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
6. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

## SESSION 7 CHALLENGING VIOLENCE IN THE COMMUNITY

<!-- image -->

SEED FOUNDATION

51

<!-- image -->

## OBJECTIVES

- To discuss how to develop and use safe and effective outcome-based interventions to prevent and interrupt sexist behaviors, violence, and conflict in school and community settings

## KEY ACTIVITIES AND TIMING

1. Welcome and Check-In - 10 minutes
2. Bystander Intervention - 60 minutes
3. Mindfulness Activity: Checking In - 5 minutes
4. Weekly Commitment - 5 minutes
5. Closing and Check-Out - 5 minutes Total session time: 85 minutes

<!-- image -->

## PREPARATION

- Print out a copy of Facilitator Resource Page 7.1 and cut out each of the bystander intervention scenarios.
- Think  about  how  you  would  answer  the  question  posed  in  the  'Giving  and  Receiving Constructive Feedback' exercise so that you can share your own experience with participants.

Facilitator  Note: Often,  when  individuals  see  someone  else  doing  something  wrong or harmful, they react in one of two ways: silence or anger/violence. One of the main goals of this exercise is to help the participants move beyond this and think - based on their own experience - about how they can challenge harmful behaviors in ways that are constructive and effective. Responding with anger and violence often feels emotionally satisfying, but it is almost guaranteed to produce a negative counter-reaction and possibly even escalate the confrontation. This exercise encourages participants to think about how to de-escalate the situation as the first step in challenging the harmful behavior.

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:
-  How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
- Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)
- Copies of the bystander intervention scenarios on Facilitator Resource Page 7.1  ('Bystander  Intervention  Scenarios'), located  at  the  end  of  this  session

<!-- image -->

3. Ask about last week's commitment: 'Did anyone try to make changes in a relationship that had unhealthy aspects to it? Or did anyone thank someone in their life with whom they have a healthy relationship? Share how your efforts went.'
4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## PART 2: BYSTANDER INTERVENTION (60 MINUTES)

## Section 1: Giving and Receiving Constructive Feedback

1. Ask participants the following question, and tell them that their answers will relate to the next exercise: 'When you have done something wrong or made a mistake, such as something that hurts another person or leads to conflict in your family, how would you prefer that people, such as your parents or a teacher, let you know?'
2. Ask participants to provide answers, writing them on a flipchart paper. If they are struggling to come up with answers, share your own perspective on this and/or share one or two of the following possible answers. If some of the following possible answers are not mentioned, feel free to bring them up for discussion:
- I  prefer that someone takes me aside after it happens and speaks to me privately instead of embarrassing me in front of the whole community.
- I prefer constructive criticism telling me what I can do better rather than just attacking me for what I did wrong.
- I think it is more effective when the criticism is focused on the behavior and is not a personal attack on my character.
- I  like it when someone explains why the behavior is wrong so I understand it rather than just saying it is wrong.
3. After you have made a list, thank participants for sharing their personal experiences and remind them that they should keep in mind what they have learned about themselves and each other during this exercise as they complete the next exercise.

## Section 2: Intervening to Challenge Sexism and Bullying and Prevent Violence

4. Then, explain that participants will be divided into small groups to brainstorm and demonstrate ways  to  effectively  intervene  to  challenge  sexism  and  bullying  and  prevent  violence.  Divide participants  into  groups  of  four  or  five  people  each
5. Give each group of participants one of the scenarios on Facilitator Resource Page 78.1 ('Bystander Intervention Scenarios').
6. Instruct participants to read the scenario out loud in their group and then develop a short skit in which they demonstrate the problem in the scenario, as well as one or more interventions that young people like themselves could use to stop the negative action. They should think about how the intervention can be effective and safe, as well as prevent future violence. They should also keep in mind their brainstorming in the first part of this exercise about how they like to be confronted when they have made a mistake or done something wrong.
7. Call the first group to perform their skit.
8. After each group performs their skit, ask the larger group to describe the intervention(s) that they saw used. Keep a list of the interventions on the flipchart paper to discuss after the groups have presented. If some interventions seem likely to escalate or inflame the situation, ask as part of the debrief if there are any disadvantages the group could see from using that approach. Also ask the performers why they chose the intervention(s) they did and why they thought these would be effective.

9. After each performance, ask the participants if they would really be comfortable enough to carry out the bystander behavior modeled in the skit. If not, ask them to consider what they would be comfortable doing. If it isn't direct engagement, perhaps it is telling a parent, teacher, or friend.
10.  By the end, you should have a list of several ways to challenge violent behavior. Highlight for the group that no matter what the situation, there are always many ways one might intervene. (Note: The following box has a few additional strategies and intervention approaches that, if they do not come up during the discussion, you may want to insert into the list and talk about with the participants.)
11.  Explain to participants that there are four ways to intervene or 'stand up': direct approach, team up, call an authority, and distract. What are some examples of each? If participants have trouble coming up with their own examples, use the following box (this is also Journal Resource Page 8.1, 'Challenging Violence in the Community'):

## Direct Approach

- Calmly ask the person to explain their actions and why they are engaging in the negative behavior. Pose questions and ask for clarification about what they are doing and why in a non confrontational way that helps to change the dynamic and may help the person realize what they are doing is a problem.
- Educate the person about the possible consequences of their actions, as well as the harm they could inflict on the victim(s) and even on themselves.
- Suggest alternative actions that can accomplish the same goal but that will provide better outcomes.
- Speak from a perspective of friendship and begin with your concern for the person. For instance, say that you do not want them to get in trouble with teachers or the police and that you think they are a better person than what their actions may suggest to others.
- Speak  from  your  own  perspective.  Rather  than  saying,  'You  shouldn't  do  that,'  use  'I' statements and explain how you feel about the person's actions, how they may bother you, or why you feel they are harmful. This method feels much less accusatory for the person being  confronted.

## Team Up

- If you do not know the person well, if you think they may respond with violence or hostility, or if you think they will not be convinced by just one person, recruit other young men from this group (or others from the community) to speak with them.

## Call an Authority

- Seek  out  an  authority  figure  who  can  do  something  about  the  situation  based  on  their position (such as a parent or police officer) or find someone whose opinion they value, such as a friend, relative, teacher, elder, or community leader.

## Distract

- Compliment or highlight something the person has done well or that you admire before bringing up what they have done wrong.
- If all else fails, try distraction. Some situations are not the time or place for education, but you can interrupt to ask for the time or directions, thus breaking the dynamic of someone using violence or sexism and possibly giving the person being targeted a chance to leave.

## THINGS NOT TO DO

- Never react with violence or too much force or with shouting and anger. This is likely to escalate  the  situation,  making  it  more  dangerous  for  everyone.
- If you fear that the person will use physical violence against you as well, then do not intervene alone. Instead, immediately alert the police or ask others in the community to help also.
- Your first  concern  is  the  health  and  safety  of  the  person  who  has  been  attacked.  If  it  is necessary to keep the victim safe, then let the other person leave the scene while you help the  victim.
12.  After making your list, ask the Group Discussion Questions:
- How did it feel to come up with these scenarios? Were they easy or hard?
- Why might someone be afraid to intervene in a situation of violence or conflict?
- Why might someone feel able to intervene in a situation?
- What are some ways that we can support ourselves and others to intervene in situations of violence or harassment?
- Who is more likely to intervene in situations? An older man? A younger man? A woman? Why might that be?
- Do young people feel comfortable or prepared to intervene in situations of violence or harassment?
- How can we take the techniques we learned today and apply them to our own lives?
13.  Read the Key Messages:
- 'There are safe and constructive ways to prevent violence, and these ways differ based on the situation,  personal  preference,  and  safety.'
- 'While there is no 'right' way to prevent or respond to violence in every setting, there are many different options, and if you think creatively, you can almost always find something that will work.'

## PART 3: MINDFULNESS ACTIVITY: CHECKING IN (5 MINUTES)

1. Tell  the  participants  that  you  will  be  leading  them  through  a  mindfulness  activity  called Checking In.
2. Ask the participants to close their eyes if they are comfortable and take three deep, long breaths.
3. Ask  them  to  think  about  the  following  questions.  Pause  for  20  seconds  between  each  of  the questions.
- How is my body feeling?
- Is there anything bothering or upsetting me?
- How have I practiced self-care today?
- What do I need right now?
- What things I am thankful for and why?
4. Ask them to take another three deep, lwong breaths and open their eyes.

## PART 4: WEEKLY COMMITMENT (5 MINUTES)

1. Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'During the next week, look for opportunities to use the different kinds of interventions discussed and demonstrated today. If you can, write down in a journal what kinds of situations you saw, whether or not you did anything, and if so, what you did. This is not a test or something you will be criticized for, but rather an opportunity to learn and practice and also to explore situations in which intervening might be more difficult.'

## PART 5: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

## SESSION 8 COMMUNICATING WITH MY FAMILY

<!-- image -->

SEED FOUNDATION

57

## OBJECTIVES

- To reflect on the importance of communication, interaction, and affection between fathers and their sons
- To develop skills for more effective communication between parents and young people
- To  reflect  on  participants'  goals  for  themselves  and  their  family;  on  young  men's  goals  for themselves and their future; and on how young men and adult men can work together to achieve their  long-term family vision

** This session was designed for fathers and sons to come together and participate jointly. If the project design does not allow for that, this session as written can be facilitated with fathers only.

**There is an alternative session in the youth curriculum called 'Session 9 ALTERNATIVE' that should be done instead, if fathers and sons don't jointly participate.

## KEY ACTIVITIES AND TIMING

1. Welcome and Check-In - 10 minutes
2. Communicating  as  a  Family  -  60 minutes
3. Our Family Vision - 45 minutes
4. Weekly Commitment - 5 minutes
5. Closing and Check-Out - 5 minutes

Total session time: 125 minutes

## PREPARATION

- Print copies of Journal Resource Page 8.1 for all participants.
- If  this  session  includes young men, make sure to meet with the facilitator of the groups for young men beforehand to discuss how your groups have gone so far and to prepare to facilitate together.
- Think about your own experiences communicating with your parents and other adults when you were younger and, if you are a parent, how you and your children communicate with each other. Make a few notes about what works and doesn't work for you so you can share them with participants.
- Take a few moments to think about your vision for your family and times when you have discussed your family vision with your partner and children so you can share your own experiences with the group as well. If you have not done this before, take some time to do so in the week leading up to the session.
- Literacy Note: This activity requires some literacy/writing ability, so be aware and mindful of participants'  levels  of  literacy.  If  you  feel  one  or  more  group  members  will  struggle,  explore alternative ways for them to complete the activity.

## MATERIALS

- Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)
- Paper and pens/pencils for all participants
- Copies of Journal Resource Page 8.1 ('Communicating as a Family') for each participant

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. If young men are attending, go around and have all participants introduce themselves and who their father/son is. Some men may want to introduce their sons, but make sure that each person introduces  himself.
3. Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:
-  How are you?
- Has anything new happened since the last session?
- Did you talk to anyone about the issues discussed in the group?
4. Ask participants if anyone had a conversation during the last week about honor-based violence and how it can be prevented in the community. If so, how did it go?
5. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## PART 2: COMMUNICATING AS A FAMILY (60 MINUTES)

1. Tell the group: 'Before we start this activity, I would like to know what you feel are the main topics or sources of conflict between parents, especially fathers, and their teenage sons.' Write down participants' answers on a flipchart paper and have them identify the top five or six most common sources of conflict.
2. Continue:  'Communication  between  parents  and  their  children  is  often  challenging  for  both groups. Teenagers want to assert their independence, try new things, be curious and explore, and do things they enjoy. They are looking ahead to a time when they will be more financially independent and perhaps move out and have a family of their own. And all of that is perfectly normal developmentally. Parents, on the other hand, worry that children will end up in a dangerous situation, may hurt themselves or someone else, or will end up with problems at school or in the community. And it can be hard for parents to admit their child is growing up. Parents are doing what they feel is best, but their children often see it as unfair, overly restrictive, or simply not making any sense.'
3. Then, say: 'In a moment we are going to break into groups of four or six people each. In each group should be two or three adult men and two or three young men, none of whom are related to each other. I want each group to select one of the sources of conflict between parents and children we just listed and to create a role-play based on that. You should create two role-plays of the same scenario.'
- 'In the first role-play, show the conflict the way it often happens, with parents and children not understanding each other, getting frustrated, and perhaps even shouting.'
- 'In  the  second  version,  show  the  conflict  but  with  both  parties  seeing  it  from  the  other's perspective, not getting frustrated, and trying to reach a solution that makes both parties happy. Perhaps each person compromises on their stance a little bit so that they meet in the middle. Demonstrate at least one, or even more, ways to constructively reach a solution. I want everyone to try using empathy, which is understanding a situation from the other person's perspective. And above all, be realistic. Don't make up a scenario that you don't believe would work in real life. '
4. Continue: 'There is just one condition: In your role-plays, the young men will play the role of fathers, and the fathers will play the role of young men. We are going to try hard to put ourselves in the other person's shoes and see the situation from their perspective, and at the same time, explore how you can avoid escalating the situation and making it worse.'
5. Break participants into groups of 4-6 fathers and give them 7 minutes to brainstorm and practice their scenario. After 7 minutes, bring the groups back together and perform one by one.

6. After each role-play, discuss it with the broader group and make a list of what the participants did to reach a solution that both parties could accept.
7. After all the role-plays, share Journal Resource Page 89.1 ('Communicating as a Family'). Give the group a few minutes to read it, and then ask the following Group Discussion Questions:
- What do you think about the list? Do you think some of the suggestions would really work? Which ones and why?
- Can you think of any situations in your life now where using some of these might help you communicate  with  your  children?
- Are there any suggestions that you think would not work as well? Why not?
-  How can we remember to 'see through someone else's eyes' when we are angry with each other?
-  What else can be done to address the common causes of disagreement between fathers and sons?
8. Close the activity by sharing the following Key Messages:
- 'Empathy means understanding a situation from another person's point of view. To do that, it  is  helpful  to  express  our  own  feelings  in  a  calm  way,  such  as  'I  can  see  that  you  are  very busy,' 'I feel frustrated about what happened,' or 'I want to understand what is bothering you.' Communicating our feelings in a constructive way allows the other person to see the situation from our eyes.'
- 'Communicating our feelings is a very important way of resolving conflict and can even help us to avoid conflict in the first place. It is also more effective than using violence.'
- 'Conflict always exists, but it does not need to be violent or angry and can be an opportunity for  personal  growth  and  development  rather  than  an  opportunity  for  violence.  When  we communicate with each other, we can resolve conflict  peacefully  and  avoid  future  conflict.'

## PART 3: OUR FAMILY VISION (45 MINUTES)

1. Explain that in this activity, each person will think about the goals they have for their family and will talk about their shared vision for the future.
2. Ask the participants to close their eyes. Read the following statements aloud slowly so that the group members can consider each sentence as you read them: 'Imagine it is five years from now…'

| QUESTIONS FOR FATHERS:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | QUESTIONS FOR YOUNG MEN:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| • What are the things you hope to have achieved in that time? • What are your hopes for yourself? What are your hopes for your partner and for your children? • What does your relationship with your partner look like? • What does your relationship with your children look like? • How do you care for each other? How do you help each other? • How do you speak to and listen to each other? | • What are the things you hope to have achieved in that time? • What are your hopes for yourself? • What does your relationship with your family look like? • Will you have a spouse and children as well? What will your relationship with them be like? • How do you care for each other? How do you help each other? • How do you speak to and listen to each other? |

3. Ask the participants to keep their eyes closed and think about this vision for the future and what it looks like.
4. Ask the group:
- How did it feel to have a vision of your and your family's future?
- Do you think your family has similar visions to your own?
5. Next, ask each participant to come up with two or three long-term goals they want themselves and their family to achieve. If they prefer, participants can write these goals down on paper or draw them, but this is not required.
6. After everyone has finished, ask if anyone would like to share their personal and family vision and goals with the group.
7. Allow enough time for participants who want to share their family vision to do so. Remember, sharing is  not  required.

Facilitator  Note: After  each  person  has  shared,  you  may  invite  other  participants  to  provide positive, constructive feedback on group members' visions, guided by the group agreements.

8. Ask some of the following Group Discussion Questions:
- Is it common for men and women, or parents and their children, to discuss the vision they have for their family's future and how they can work together to achieve it? Why or why not? Why might it be beneficial to do this more?
- How important is it for men and women to have a shared vision and work together for the development  and  well-being  of  the  family?
- How can fathers and sons support each other to achieve their visions?
- Do traditional gender roles, or expectations of how men and women should behave, make it difficult for men and women to achieve their family vision? If so, how?
- How can men's participation in caring for children and doing household chores help contribute to achieving the family vision?
- How can your participation in these meetings help contribute to achieving your family vision?
9. Thank  the  participants  for  sharing  their  experiences  and  ideas.  Share  the Key  Message: 'Communication between family members is important for setting goals for your family. Men and women working together as a couple - such as supporting each other to work, sharing household responsibilities, and encouraging each other as parents - can help you to achieve these goals and support the health, happiness, and economic prosperity of your family. And bringing your children into the discussion, hearing their hopes and dreams, can help clarify that vision and make it easier for parents to support their children.'

## PART 4: WEEKLY COMMITMENT (5 MINUTES)

1. Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'Try  and apply some of this week's lessons, discussion, and communication skills in your interactions with each other during the coming week. Notice what works and areas in which you can develop your skills more. Also, share your vision for your family's future with other members of your family and ask them to share theirs with you. How are yours similar and different?'

## PART 5: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing their thoughts, questions, concerns, and experiences today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

## PART 2: COMMUNICATING WITH MY FAMILY (30 MINUTES)

1. Tell the group: 'Before we start this activity, I would like to ask: What do you feel are the main topics or sources of conflict between parents and their children who are your age?' Write down participants' answers on a flipchart paper and have them identify the four most common sources of conflict.
2. Continue  the  activity  by  saying:  'Communication  between  parents  and  their  children  is  often challenging  for  both  groups,  especially  when  children  are  older.  Children  want  to  assert  their independence, try new things, be curious and explore, and do things they enjoy. All of that is perfectly normal developmentally. Parents, on the other hand, worry that children will get hurt or end up in a dangerous situation, will accidentally hurt someone else, or will end up with problems at school or in the community. They are doing what they feel is best, but their children often see it as unfair, overly restrictive, or simply not making any sense.'
3. Then, say: 'In a moment, we are going to break into four groups. I want each group to select one of the sources of conflict between parents and children we just listed and to create a roleplay based on that. You should show the conflict, but also show one or more ways to resolve the conflict with both parties seeing it from the other's perspective, not getting frustrated, and trying to reach a solution that makes both parties happy. I want everyone to try using empathy, which is understanding a situation from the other person's perspective. And above all, be realistic. Don't make up a scenario that you don't believe would work in real life.'
4. Break participants into 4 groups and give them 7 minutes to brainstorm and practice their scenario. After 7 minutes, bring the groups back together and perform one by one.
5. After each role-play, discuss the role-play with participants and make a list of what the performers did to reach a solution that both parties could accept.
6. After all the role-plays, ask participants to open Journal Resource Page 8.1 ('Communicating With My Parents'). Give the group a few minutes to read it, and then ask the following Group Discussion Questions:
- What do you think about the list? Do you think some of the suggestions would really work? Which ones and why?
- Can you think of any situations in your life now where using some of these might help you communicate  with  your  parents?
- Are there any suggestions that you think would not work as well? Why not?
- How can we remember to 'see through someone else's eyes' when we are angry with someone?
-  What else can be done to address the common causes of disagreement between parents and children?

## 7. Read the Key Messages:

- 'Communication with your parents is going to be really hard sometimes, but it's very important for a good relationship. It's important to always use statement that tell them how you are feeling and provide solutions to problems.'
- 'When speaking to parents, its important what you say, how you say it, and when you bring it up. The handout we gave you in your Journal gives you some great tips for that.'

## PART 3: MY SUPPORT NETWORK (25 MINUTES)

1. Explain to the participants that you are going to do an activity that will make them think about the important relationships in their lives and the people they can turn to for support or advice when they have a problem. How can we build a network to help achieve some of the goals we have for ourselves?
2. Ask participants  to  open  to  Journal  Resource  Page  8.2  ('My  Support  Network')  and  give  each person a pen or pencil. Tell the participants to think about the people they turn to for advice when they have a problem.
3. Tell the group they should put themselves at the center of the circle. In the circles around the center, they should write the names of those they can rely on for support or advice. The people they can rely on the most should be in the rings closest to the center. Those who provide less support or advice should be placed in the outer rings/circles. Tell the participants that 'support' can be either advice or financial or material assistance.
4. Give the participants 15 minutes to complete their networks. Then, ask if any of the participants would like to share their social support network with the whole group. After some individuals have shared their networks, open the discussion using the following Group Discussion Questions:
- Was it easy or difficult to identify the people you can rely on for help and support?
- In what ways do these people and networks help you as an individual? What advice do they provide?
- How do ideas of manhood or stereotypes about men impact our ability to ask for or receive support?
- If you are having a disagreement with a sibling, other family member, or friend, whom can you turn to for advice?
- Are there people you would like to rely on for more help, support, and guidance?
- How can we build those lines of communication?
- How can we provide the same type of support we wish to have from others?

## 5. Read the Key Messages:

- 'Having people around to support you makes you a stronger person, family, and community. There  are  many  different  types  of  support  we  need  as  humans  and  some  people  can  play different  support  roles  in  your  life. '
-  'You, too, can be part of someone's support network. Remember that whenever someone is feeling down or in need, they might lean on you for support.'

## PART 4: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (5 MINUTES)

1. Thank all participants for sharing today.
2. Ask the group:
- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
3. After addressing the questions and other comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
5. Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session if there are any changes.

3. Final Reflections - 20 minutes
4. Post-test - 20 minutes
5. Closing and Check-Out - 10 minutes

Total session time: 90 minutes

## PREPARATION

- Make several copies of Facilitator Resource Page 9.1 ('Adjustments to Life Scenarios') and cut out the scenarios.
- Take a few moments to reflect on your experience facilitating this group, thinking about what you have learned, what you have enjoyed, and what you will take from this experience. Write a few notes about that in the following box and be prepared to talk about it with the group. That will  model the process for them and help reinforce that the facilitator and participants were co-learners in this experience.

## PART 1: WELCOME AND CHECK-IN (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.
2. State that today is the final session they will have together as a group. Say a few words about how much this group has meant to you and what you have learned from them as participants.

## MATERIALS

- Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)
- Multiple copies of Facilitator Resource Page 9.1 (' Adjustments to Life Scenarios')
- Art supplies
- Certificates of Completion

Write some notes here about what you'd like to say about how much this group has meant to you and what you have learned from the participants.

3. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## PART 2: WHO AM I? WHERE AM I GOING? (30 MINUTES)

1. Invite the participants to sit comfortably, take a deep breath, and close their eyes. Ask them to think  about  the  following  questions:
- How would I describe myself?
- What do I like doing the most? The least?
- What have I been told I do well?
2. Tell the participants they will have 20 minutes to draw, paint, or create something that represents who they are. Write the questions from the previous step on flipchart paper so that the participants can refer to them while creating their pictures.
3. After  the  participants  finish  their  representations,  invite  them  to  think  about  the  following questions,  and  write  them  down  on  a  piece  of  paper:
- What do I want to be like in ten years?
- What will 'success' look like at that time?
4. Tell them to now draw a picture of themselves ten years from now.
5. Ask the participants to think about any barriers or challenges to achieving those goals. What are some things that may prevent them from reaching these goals? Which of these barriers do they have the power to overcome, and which barriers are outside of their control? Begin to distribute the 'Adjustments to Life Scenarios' cards. Remind them that this is just a game and not real life.
6. Have each participant read their card to themselves. After a minute, give yourself a card and read it aloud. Discuss with the group why this would make it very difficult for you to accomplish your goal.
7. Go around to each participant and discuss how their 'adjustment to life scenario' would affect their ability to accomplish their goals. Ask:
- What are some ways you can prevent this possibility from happening?
- If one of these things were to happen, how could you continue to work toward your goals? What are some of your options?

8. Divide  the  participants  into  several  groups  based  on  their  'adjustment'  (that  is,  all  those  who received 'arrested for committing a crime on social media' should be grouped together). Tell them to discuss some of the options they presented and the following questions as groups:
-  Why might someone choose this option?
-  Why might someone not choose this option?
9. Allow them to discuss for about five to ten minutes, and then bring them back into a large circle and ask the Group Discussion Questions:
- What things do people consider when setting goals for the future?
- How flexible are most people when things don't go as planned?
-  (When applicable) How might someone avoid negative adjustments?
- What are some things that could happen that you might not be able to control?
- How can we apply the lessons from our group to achieving some of these goals or desires we have for our future?

## PART 3: FINAL REFLECTIONS (20 MINUTES)

1. Explain that in this activity, the participants will reflect on how the group sessions have benefited them and some of the positive changes they have made in their lives.
2. Tell the group: 'Over these ten sessions, we have all learned from each other and grown in many ways. We have learned about ourselves, our friends and families, and our society. We have learned things that will help change ourselves and those around us for the better. But change is a gradual process; it does not happen overnight. It is important to take time to appreciate the changes we have made and to commit ourselves to continuing this process of positive change.'
3. Explain that each person, if they feel comfortable doing so, will have the opportunity to share with the group what they have enjoyed about the group sessions and how they feel the group has positively changed them. If the group is very large, this can be done in smaller groups.
4. Ask who would like to volunteer to go first. Then, ask for another volunteer and continue until everyone who would like to share has had time to do so.
5. After everyone has shared, ask if any of the participants would like to provide feedback to those who have shared their stories. These should be words of encouragement and support.
6. After  any  feedback  has  been  provided,  thank  everyone  for  sharing  and  congratulate  everyone on the important changes and steps they have made in their lives. Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the Key Message: 'This is only the beginning of the process of change. All of us can commit to continuing to improve ourselves and playing a role in making our families, communities, and world a better place. This change can be sustained and expanded through the support and commitment of all of those here today. I encourage all of you to continue to support each other and seek support from your family and community in making positive changes.'

## PART 4: POST-TEST (20 MINUTES)

1. Hand out the post-test survey and have participants take time to complete it.
2. Collect the completed post-test surveys.

## PART 5: CLOSING AND CHECK-OUT (10 MINUTES)

1. Thank participants again for their participation in the group over the past several weeks. Encourage them to continue learning, listening, and practicing their new skills.
2. Encourage participants, if they have not already and want to, to exchange contact information so that they can continue communicating with each other now that the group has been completed.
3. Hand out certificates of completion (optional) and close the group with one final check-out.

## APPENDIX A: SAMPLE ENERGIZERS AND ICEBREAKERS

## Ha, H a

Begin by having all the players sit in a circle. Tell all of  the  players  they  have  to  remain  as  solemn  and serious as they can throughout the game. Pick one player  to  start  the  game  by  saying  'Ha'  once.  The player standing next to him says the word 'Ha' twice. Following  this  pattern,  the  third  player  says  'Ha' three times. As the game progresses, eliminate any players who laugh or make noise when it is not their turn. The player who avoids laughing throughout the game  wins.

## Get in Motion

Ask group members to stand. Ask them to shake their right arm, then their left arm, then their right leg, and then their left leg. Now, tell participants that you will count to ten while they shake each limb. They will shake their right arm ten times, then their left arm ten times, followed by their right leg ten times, and their left leg ten times - you can count to ten out loud for  each  limb.  As  soon  as  participants  have  shaken each limb ten times, go through the cycle again, but only count to nine. Proceed, counting to eight, then seven, then six, then five, and so on until participants only  shake  each  limb  once.  To  make  the  energizer more exciting, you can count faster and faster as you go.

## The Stomp

Ask  everyone  to  stand  in  a  circle.  Teach  them  a three-count  stomp  pattern  and  do  it  together  (for example: stomp-stomp-clap, stomp-stomp-clap). Then, teach them a four-count pattern (like stompstomp-stomp-clap, stomp-stomp-stomp-clap).

Divide  the  participants  into  two  groups.  Have  one group do the first pattern and the second group do the  second  pattern.  If  there  is  more  time,  you  can have  individuals  create  their  own  patterns  for  the group  to  imitate.

## The Spaghetti

Have  the  group  form  a  tight  circle  with  everyone sticking their hands into the center. Instruct everyone to use one hand to grab the hand of another person. Then, using the other hand, they should each grab the hand of someone different. Tell participants that the object of the game is to get untangled without letting go; by climbing, crawling, and  wriggling around, participants can create one large open circle or,  sometimes,  two  unconnected  ones.  If  they  are totally stuck, you can tell them they can choose to undo one link, and then reconnect once that person has turned around, seeing if that works. (Note: This energizer  is  fun  and  creates  a  nice  physical  bond between  participants.  It  also  subtly  communicates ideas of working together to accomplish a task.)

## The Shrinking Iceberg

Put a blanket or several sheets of newspaper on the floor. Ask the group to stand on it. Then, explain that this is an iceberg that is melting away, reducing in size by half every month. Their object is to see how long they can all stay on it. Ask them to get off and fold the blanket in half or remove half the paper. Repeat, each time reducing the area by half, and see how they can find ways to support each other to allow everyone to stay on.

## APPENDIX B: ADDITIONAL MINDFULNESS ACTIVITIES

## Mindfulness Activity: Body Scan

No materials required

Tell  the  participants  that  you  will  be  leading  them through  a  mindfulness  activity  called  Body  Scan. During  this  activity,  you  will  be  having  them  close their  eyes  or  soften  their  gaze  and  walking  them through an activity in which they will be able to take some time and pay attention to what their body is feeling.  Then,  read  the  script:

Begin by making yourself comfortable. Sit in a chair and  allow  your  back  to  be  straight,  but  not  stiff, with your feet on the ground. You could also do this practice standing or if you prefer, you can lie down and have your head supported. Your hands could be resting gently in your lap or at your side. Allow your eyes to close, or to remain open with a soft gaze.

Take  several  long,  slow,  deep  breaths.  Breathing  in fully  and  exhaling  slowly.  Breathe  in  through  your nose and out through your nose or mouth. Feel your stomach expand on an inhale and relax and let go as you  exhale.

Begin to let go of noises around you. Begin to shift your attention from outside to inside yourself. If you are distracted by sounds in the room, simply notice this and bring your focus back to your breathing.

Now slowly bring your attention down to your feet. Begin observing sensations in your feet. You might want  to  wiggle  your  toes  a  little,  feeling  your  toes against  your  socks  or  shoes.  Just  notice,  without judgment.  You  might  imagine  sending  your  breath down to your feet, as if the breath is traveling through the nose to the lungs and through the abdomen all the way down to your feet. And then back up again out  through  your  nose  and  lungs.  Perhaps  you don't feel anything at all. That is fine, too. Just allow yourself to feel the sensation of not feeling anything.

When  you  are  ready,  allow  your  feet  to  dissolve in  your  mind's  eye  and  move  your  attention  up  to your ankles, calves, knees and thighs. Observe the sensations  you  are  experiencing  throughout  your legs. Breathe into and breathe out of the legs. If your mind begins to wander during this exercise, gently notice  this  without  judgment  and  bring  your  mind back to noticing the sensations in your legs. If you notice any discomfort, pain or stiffness, don't judge this. Just simply notice it. Observe how all sensations rise and fall, shift and change moment to moment.

Notice how no sensation is permanent. Just observe and allow the sensations to be in the moment, just as they are. Breathe into and out from the legs.

Then on the next out breath, allow the legs to dissolve in  your  mind.  And  move  to  the  sensations  in  your lower back and pelvis. Softening and releasing as you breathe in and out. Slowly move your attention up to  your  mid  back  and  upper  back.  Become  curious about the sensations here. You may become aware of  sensations in the muscle, temperature or points of contact with furniture.…With each outbreath, you may let go of tension you are carrying. And then very gently shift your focus to your stomach and all the internal organs here. Perhaps you notice the feeling of clothing, the process of digestion or the belly rising or  falling  with  each  breath.  If  you  notice  opinions arising  about  these  areas,  gently  let  these  go  and return  to  noticing  sensations.  As  you  continue  to breathe, bring your awareness to the chest and heart region and just notice your heartbeat. Observe how the chest rises during the inhale and how the chest falls during the exhale. Let go of any judgments that may arise. On the next outbreath, shift the focus to your  hands  and  fingertips.  See  if  you  can  channel your breathing into and out of this area as if you are breathing into and out from your hands. If your mind wanders,  gently  bring  it  back  to  the  sensations  in your  hands.

And then, on the next outbreath, shift the focus and bring  your  awareness  up  into  your  arms.  Observe the  sensations  or  lack  of  sensations  that  may  be occurring  there.  You  might  notice  some  difference between the left arm and the right arm - no need to judge this. As you exhale, you may experience the arm soften and release tensions. Continue to breathe and shift focus to the neck, shoulder and throat region. This is an area where we often have tension. Be with the sensations here. It could be tightness, rigidity or holding. You may notice the shoulders moving along with the breath. Let go of any thoughts or stories you are telling about this area. As you breathe, you may feel tension rolling off your shoulders.

On the next out breath, shift your focus and direct your attention to the scalp, head and face. Observe all  of  the  sensations  occurring  there.  Notice  the movement of the air as you breathe into or out of the nostrils or mouth. As you exhale, you might notice the softening of any tension you may be holding.

And now, let your attention to expand out to include the entire body as a whole. Bring into your awareness the  top  of  your  head  down  to  the  bottom  of  your toes.  Feel  the  gentle  rhythm  of  the  breath  as  it moves through the body. As you come to the end of this practice, take a full, deep breath, taking in all the energy of this practice. Exhale fully. And when you are ready, open your eyes and return your attention to the present moment.

As you become fully alert and awake, consider setting the intention that this practice of building awareness will benefit everyone you come in contact with today.

## Journal Resource Page 3.1: Understanding Power

Some types of power exist in relation to other people or  resources:  We  have  (or  do  not  have)  power  in relation to another person or group that has more, less,  or  the  same  power we do. It is a relationship. For example, this includes a teacher and student or a parent and child.

Power  is  not  fixed:  It  is  not  something  we  are biologically  born  with  (that  is,  it  is  not  inherent to  us  but  is  constructed  based  on  circumstance, community,  and  context)  or  something  that  we always have all the time. We are constantly moving in  and  out  of  situations  and  relationships  in  which we have more or less power - for example, a woman who  is  a  supervisor  at  work  has  power  over  her employees, but she may not have the same level of power  at  home  with  her  husband.

Power can lead to positive and negative feelings: We often feel positive and in control when we are feeling powerful,  and  we  have  negative  feelings  when  we are  feeling  less  powerful.  This  affects  our  ability  to influence and take action in a situation.

There are different types of power, which can be used in different ways. These are:

Power  over: To  have  control  over  someone  or  a situation in a negative way, usually associated with repression,  force,  corruption,  discrimination,  and abuse. This involves 'taking power' from someone else and then using it to dominate and prevent others from taking it - a win-lose situation.

Power with: To have power on the basis of collective strength and/or numbers - to have power with people or groups, to find common ground among different interests,  and  to  build  a  common  goal  to  benefit all  those  in  the  collective.  This  power  multiplies individual  talents  and  knowledge  and  is  based  on support,  solidarity,  and  collaboration.

Power to: The ability  to  shape  and  influence  one's life.  It  refers  to  having  the  ideas,  knowledge,  skills, money, and ability to convince yourself and others to do something. When many people have this kind of power, it can also create 'power with.'

Power within: A person's feelings of self-worth and self-knowledge.  This  is  related  to  people's  ability to imagine a better life for themselves and to have hope and the sense that they can change the world - the feeling that they have rights as human beings. It  involves  having  a  sense  of  self-confidence  and  a feeling  that  they  have  value  because  they  exist.

## Journal Resource Page 5.1: What Do I Do When I Am Angry?

1. Think of times recently in which you felt angry. What happened? Describe this briefly in one or two  sentences.
2. After  thinking  about  these  scenarios,  try  to remember  what  you  were  thinking  about  and what  you  felt.  List  some  of  these  feelings.
3. When we feel angry, we often resort to violence. This might happen even before we realize it as

a  reaction  that  for  some  people  is  instant  and manifests as yelling and throwing things across the  room  or  hitting  something  or  someone. In  other  times,  we  may  get  depressed,  isolate ourselves,  or  remain  silent.  Now  that  you're rethinking the scenario in which you were angry, how  did  that  anger  manifest?  How  did  you behave? Write a sentence or a few words about your  actions.

## Journal Resource Page 7.1: Challenging Violence in the Community

## Direct Approach

- Calmly ask the person to explain their actions and why they are engaging in the negative behavior. Pose questions and ask for clarification about what they are doing and why in a nonconfrontational way that helps to change the dynamic and also may help the person realize what they are doing is a problem.
- Educate the person about the possible consequences  of  their  actions,  as  well  as  the harm they could inflict on the victim(s) and even on themselves.
- Suggest alternative  actions  that  can  accomplish the same  goal but that will provide better outcomes.
- Speak from a perspective of friendship and begin with  your  concern  for  the  person.  For  instance, say that you do not want them to get in trouble with teachers or the police and that you think they are a better person than what their actions may suggest to others.
- Speak  from  your  own  perspective.  Rather  than saying, 'You shouldn't do that,' use 'I' statements and  explain  how  you  feel  about  the  person's actions,  how  they  may  bother  you,  or  why  you feel  they  are  harmful.  This  method  feels  much less accusatory for the person being confronted.

## Team Up

- If  you  do  not  know the person well, if you think they may respond with violence or hostility, or if you think they will not be convinced by just one person, recruit other young men from this group (or  others  from  the  community)  to  speak  with them.

## Call an Authority

- Seek out an authority figure who can do something about the situation based on their position (such as  a  parent  or  police  officer)  or  find  someone whose  opinion  they  value,  such  as  a  friend, relative,  teacher,  elder,  or  community  leader.

## Distract

- Compliment  or  highlight  something  the  person has done well or that you admire before bringing up what they have done wrong.
- If all else fails, try distraction. Some situations are not the time or place for education, but you can interrupt  to  ask  for  the  time  or  directions,  thus breaking the dynamic of someone using violence or  sexism  and  possibly  giving  the  person  being targeted a chance to leave.

## THINGS NOT TO DO

- Never  react  with  violence  or  too  much  force  or with shouting and anger. This is likely to escalate the  situation,  making  it  more  dangerous  for everyone.
- If  you fear that the person will use physical violence against you as well, then do not intervene alone. Instead, immediately alert the police or ask others in the community to help also.

Your  first  concern  is  the  health  and  safety  of  the person who has been attacked. If it is necessary to keep the victim safe, then let the other person leave the scene while you help the victim.

## Journal Resource Page 8.1: Communicating With My Parents

## What You Say

- Talk  for  yourself.  Don't  let  others  talk  for  you.  No  one will  express your thoughts, feelings, or ideas as well as you.
- Begin  your  statements  with  the  word  'I,'  not 'you': 'I feel hurt when you talk to me like that' rather than 'You never talk to me like I am human.'
- Show respect for each other's uniqueness. Once in a while, put aside the fact they are your parent and listen like they are someone else.
- Say you are sorry when you have done something wrong.
- Admit it when the other person is or may be right or when they may have a better idea.
- Show  your  appreciation  for  each  other.  Notice what  each  is  doing  right.
- Be  aware  of  your  tone  of  voice  and  leave  the attitude  outside.  If  you  can't,  take  time  to  cool down  before  beginning  the  conversation.
- Ask why they said something or made a decision rather  than  assuming  why.  Then  respond  based on that explanation.

## How You Say It

- Work on controlling your body language: Rolling eyes, heavy sighing, and other emotional reactions take your parents' attention away from what  you  are  saying.
- Pay  attention  to  your  reaction  inside.  If  you're upset, take time to cool down. We don't talk or hear  very  well  when  we  are  upset.
- Listen to what is being said to you as well; take it in, and then give your perspective.

## When You Say It

- If  upset, take time to cool down before trying to talk. We don't talk, think, or hear clearly when we are upset.
- Time your conversations. Don't wait until you are upset; don't try to talk when you are busy, tired, or hungry or when your parents are busy, tired, or hungry.

## And Finally…

- Think about what it would be like to be your parent. This won't change what you want, but it helps you understand your parent's reactions. That can help you calm down and speak more clearly.
- Do it the other person's way once in a while.
