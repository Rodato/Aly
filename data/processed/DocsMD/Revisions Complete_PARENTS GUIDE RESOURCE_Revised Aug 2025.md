## Complementing Gender Equality Efforts in Education

The Lifting Barriers Global Resources on supporting boys' engagement in education is designed to complement, not compete with, existing efforts to promote girls' education and gender equality in schools. Significant progress has been made in addressing barriers to girls' education and this important work must continue. At the same time, many boys face challenges that impact their learning, well-being, and future opportunities. This guide aims to be a complement to broader gender equality efforts, including those focused on girls' education. Teachers, parents, and school leaders can use the Lifting Barriers materials alongside existing strategies to ensure all learners have the support they need to succeed.

Strengthening boys' engagement in education is not just about improving outcomes for boys; it also contributes to gender equality more broadly. When schools challenge harmful and restrictive masculine norms and foster more inclusive spaces, girls as well as boys benefit from more equitable learning environments, free from harmful stereotypes and imbalances. Ensuring all children, regardless of gender, can fully participate in their education is essential for building a more just and equal society.

## Overview

The Guide to Working with Parents and Caregivers to Support Boys' Education is designed to support educators build supportive and collaborative relationships with parents and caregivers as they implement initiatives to support boys' engagement in education. UNESCO's 2022 Global report on boys' disengagement from education highlighted that common beliefs about how boys should behave - at home, in school, and in the community - can make it difficult for them to stay interested in learning and do well in school. Strong relationships are important for fostering parents' and caregivers' trust and confidence in educational institutions, which in turn motivates them to encourage their sons to participate actively in their learning.

As educators read through this guide, they will find:

- Recommendations on how to work with parents and caregivers to support boys' education and gender equality at home
- Suggested structures for parent meetings that ensure parents and caregivers are informed about initiatives to support boys' education
- Ideas on how to keep parents and caregivers engaged throughout the school year

Guide

This guide is part of a set of Global Resources from the Lifting Barriers Project for educators both inside and outside the classroom on how to keep boys in school, support them throughout their education, with a view of contributing to gender equality. They are designed to be used together to maximize the impact on boys' engagement in education. Other Global Resources include:

- Educators' Guide: Start here! A resource to promote gender-transformative and inclusive pedagogy, equipping educators with strategies to create gender-equitable learning environments that support both boys' and girls' growth and academic success.
- In-Classroom Modules for Educators: Lesson plans and activities that help teachers introduce gender equality topics in the classroom, enhancing boys' and students' awareness of societal gender inequalities and how these shape their lives, opportunities, and choices.
- Boys Club Implementation Guide: A resource to support facilitators in creating and sustaining Boys' Clubs-safe, engaging spaces where boys can explore healthy and positive masculinity, build social-emotional skills, and contribute to gender equality and their own educational success.
- Guidance for Teaching and Learning Materials: This guide has been developed to support Ministries of Education and other stakeholders involved in the revision or development of teaching and learning materials with the aim of ensuring that these materials actively promote gender equality and inclusion.

Each resource is designed to complement the others, ensuring a holistic approach to fostering boys' engagement in education and gender equality.

## Introduction

As evidenced by the 2022 UNESCO Global report on boys' disengagement from education, in many countries boys are at greater risk than girls of repeating grades, having poor learning outcomes, and failing to complete their education. Since the early 2000s, boys' disengagement has been a concern in high- or upper-middle-income contexts, or in regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean. And new patterns are emerging. Gender gaps in some low and lower-middle income countries - where historically girls were less likely to be in school - are narrowing and several countries are facing a 'reversal' in gender gaps, with fewer boys progressing and completing their education. Across all countries, evidence of boys' disengagement is most prevalent at the secondary level. Boys' disengagement from education is influenced by multiple factors, including societal expectations of how to be a man, strict and inflexible teaching methods, and other social, economic, and cultural factors in families, communities, and school environments.  In particular, masculine norms and gender stereotypes often serve to discourage boys from achieving academic success.  One of the places boys learn how to view themselves and the world around them is through their interactions with their parents and other adult caregivers. The home can be a place where gender norms can shape and support gender-equitable behaviors and reinforce gender-transformative education. At the same time, parents themselves can also be influenced by gender norms and stereotypes to teach children what they can and cannot do based on their sex - including how or where to play, which toys are appropriate, the stories they are told, whether or for how long they go to school. 1 Engaging parents and caregivers to support learning and foster more gender equitable norms with boys is critical to complement efforts to support boys' greater engagement in education. The overall purpose of this short guide is to serve as a resource for schools and educators, as well as other key stakeholders, to keep parents and caregivers informed of what their children will be learning, as well as, more broadly, raise awareness with parents on the value of education for boys and how gender equality in their lives enhances their well-being.

## How to Use the Parents and Caregivers Guide

Use this guide in conjunction with the other 'Lifting Barriers' global resources. In an ideal setting, the meetings with parents (for brevity, 'parents' in this guide refers to all parents and caregivers) should be held before implementing initiatives to address boys' disengagement from education in schools. Parents appreciate transparency and open communication with their children's schools. Oftentimes, critical discussions about gender equality with learners will cause behavior change in their children that they were not expecting (e.g. a son wanting to help with the dishes when they did not express a desire to do this before). Parents will be more willing to be engaged and support efforts and reinforce messages at home if they understand what the initiative is about, if they are asked for input, and are given opportunities to ask questions.

This guide is aimed towards parents with upper primary school learners (roughly, ages 9 to 12 years old). The ages of upper primary students vary slightly across different countries, but generally, 'upper

primary' refers to the last few years of primary education before transitioning to lower secondary school.

While this - and all the global resources - focus on supporting boys' engagement in education, all learners should be enabled to challenge rigid gender norms and learn from learning materials that are gender-transformative. This means educators should seek to engage parents of all learners - boys, girls, and their peers, regardless of their gender identity, and emphasize how the initiative will benefit them all.

## Recommendations for Working with Parents

In your interactions with parents, it is important to take an asset-based approach where you emphasize:

- For boys : Their strengths, their potential to lead with others, and capacity for growth, rather than treating them as problems to be fixed. Very young adolescence is a period of opportunity to support boys to live up to their full potential, and all young people need emotionally supportive family and peer networks, as well as space to define what manhood and womanhood mean to them. Stress that initiatives that support boys' engagement in and through education are needed for them to succeed both in school and in life.
- For parents: Valuing parents' insights into their sons' learning, interests, and challenges, and seeing them as partners in education. It is also important to frame their engagement as a collaboration rather than a correction, ensuring parents feel respected and involved, with your meetings as opportunities to offer resources and ideas.

## Why This Matters for Girls Too

Parents may also have questions about if this initiative addresses girls' education. Addressing boys' disengagement in education benefits all learners, including girls. Explain to parents that when boys are more engaged in learning, classrooms become more focused, respectful, and supportive environments for all learners. Encouraging boys to succeed academically also helps challenge gender stereotypes that underpin some types of school violence (including against girls), promoting equality and mutual respect. By supporting this initiative, we create a school culture where both boys and girls can thrive, free from limiting expectations and distractions.

## Tips for Parents

As you share with parents the drivers behind boys' disengagement from education, they may have questions with regard to how to raise kind, caring, successful, and respectful boys, or they may think that the behavior of their boys is natural and that boys do not need to change. Here are some tips to share with parents on how to support more gender-equitable homes and support boys' education. There is also a sample handout that you can adapt to share with parents as a take-home resource at the end of this guide.

## To support more gender-equitable homes, parents can 2 :

1. Encourage free self- expression through play. They can introduce boys to a range of games and activities, including those that might be traditionally thought of as 'for girls,' as well as gender-neutral toys. It's also a good idea to avoid games and activities that reinforce harmful stereotypes for any gender.

Example of what parents can say: 'You can play with any toy you like. What matters is that you're having fun and being yourself - there are no 'boy' or 'girl' boys in this house.'

2. Encourage and model empathy in their interactions with their children. Parents can show empathy in their daily interactions-whether it's with them, their partner, friends, or even strangers. When children see their parents expressing understanding and compassion, they're more likely to mirror that behavior. Parents can use stories and media to ask, 'how do you think that character felt? What would you do if you were in their shoes?'

Example of what parents can say: Using stories and media, you can ask, 'How do you think that character felt? What would you do if you were in their shoes?'

3. Celebrate diverse interests inside and outside the home . Boys often feel pressure to pursue certain activities seen as appropriate for their gender. Parents can encourage them to explore a variety of other activities based on their interests, such as dance or cooking. They should also support boys to be their authentic selves and celebrate all of the facets of who they are, breaking free from gender stereotypes.

Example of what parents can say, 'If you like dancing (or cooking or drawing), that's amazing - go for it! Everyone should get to do what they love, no matter what others say.'

4. Be part of the emotional support system. Parents can help boys feel supported and that they will not be judged for asking questions, being curious, or sharing their emotions. Parents can make boys feel safe by saying that they can always talk with them, even when they are upset, hurt, or confused.

Example of what parents can say: 'It's okay to feel sad or confused. You can always talk to me about what you're going through. I'm here to listen and help.'

## To support boys' education, parents can:

1. Embrace reading at home. Parents can let their sons choose books based on their interests and have, if resources allow, books easily accessible in the home. Free books (including e-books) are also available in public libraries, usually accessible in urban centers. Fathers and other male caregivers can model reading by enjoying books, newspapers, and magazines.

Example of what parents can say: 'Pick any book you're curious about - I'd love to hear what it's about after. I'm going to sit and read mine too.'

2. Encourage a 'growth mindset.' Boys can become discouraged when they feel they're not able to keep up with their peers academically. Parents can teach them that making mistakes is part of learning and praise their effort .

Example of what parents can say: 'It's okay not to get it right the first time. What matters is that you're trying - that's how your brain grows!'

3. Create a structured learning environment. Parents can help sons to set up a consistent routine of doing school work and studying. They can help boys to find a quiet space or have 'quiet hours' at home.

Example of what parents can say: 'Let's figure out the best time for you to do your homework every day so you have time to relax and play too.'

4. Pay attention to potential road blocks to learning. Both female (such as mothers) and male caregivers (such as fathers) should strive, as much as they are able to, to be equally involved at school by attending meetings with teachers. They can ask boys what homework they have that evening, and consult with teachers about simple strategies to support learning in the home.

Example of what parents can say: 'Do you have any homework today? Do you want me to check in with your teacher to see how I can support you better at home?'

5. Celebrate their achievements. Parents can provide a supportive environment by recognizing when their sons are making progress in school - not just results. They can reward them for doing well with special outings or simple words of affirmation.

Example of what parents can say: 'I noticed how hard you worked on that project. You didn't give up - you must be proud of yourself!'

6. Avoid harsh punishments. Harsh punishment - such as shouting or hitting - can harm boys' emotional well-being, lower their self-esteem, and increase aggression or defiance. At  home, parents should practice positive discipline -like setting clear expectations, using consistent consequences, and encouraging open communication.

Example of what parents can say: 'I know you made a mistake, but we're going to talk it through or figure out what to do differently next time. You can always come to me.'

## Working with Fathers and Male Caregivers

Fathers and other male caregivers, such as uncles or older brothers, are sometimes overlooked when schools seek to engage parents in their children's education. However, the men in boys' lives play an important role in shaping their attitudes toward education, gender equality, and personal development. These male caregivers can model and support gender equality for their young sons by dividing household work and caregiving responsibilities fairly, demonstrating empathy for others including treating women with equality and respect, and teaching their children about boundaries and consent, among many other actions.

As you reach out to parents and caregivers, ensure any materials are also inclusive of male caregivers. In your meetings emphasize how important fathers are as role models for their sons, while also being sensitive that many children may not have fathers present in their lives. Invite fathers and other male caregivers  to meetings, workshops, and any school activities. Materials meant for parents should also describe the important role male caregivers can play in supporting their children's education.

## Parent Meetings

It is suggested to have at least two meetings during the school year with parents of all learners (boys and girls) - one to introduce the initiative on boys' education and a second to share the positive impact. There are also suggestions on how to keep parents engaged throughout the school year towards the end of this section.

## Outline for Parent Meeting 1: Introducing Boys and Education Initiatives to Parents

## 1. PRE-MEETING PREPARATION

Aim to hold the first meeting with parents and caregivers before conducting the Educator's Guide, Classroom Lessons, and Boys' Clubs. These meetings should be done in close coordination with the school management and educators who are involved in the initiative. You can invite wider parent teacher associations and committees, as well as representatives of the local education office to participate in this first meeting.

- Choose a convenient time and location . Usually, either one or both parents work and have more limited hours during the workday. Consider having in-person and hybrid options for multiple caregivers to join.
- Send invitations and reminders through appropriate channels (e.g. physical invitations, through parent chat groups, email). Make sure to explicitly invite fathers and explain why their presence is important to the success of the meeting.
- Assign roles and responsibilities . Initiatives to address boys' disengagement from education and promote gender equality should be supported institution-wide. Invite representatives from across school leadership and administration to take on roles during the meeting.
- Prepare short, straightforward reasons why boys' disengagement from education is an important issue for your education institution to address . Explain why it matters for parents such as:
- Limits Future Opportunities - Boys who disengage from education may face fewer career prospects, lower earnings, and less financial stability.
- Increases Risky Behaviors - School disengagement is linked to higher risks of delinquency, substance use, and mental health struggles.
- Affects Family Well-being - Struggles in school can lead to stress at home, strained relationships, and long-term financial pressures.
- Reinforces Gender Inequalities -When boys don't stay engaged in school, they miss chances to learn how to treat others with fairness and respect. This can lead to problems later in life, like unfair treatment of girls and women at home, work, or in relationships.
- Prepare necessary materials . You may want to prepare handouts with more information about the initiative and key tips parents implement at home to support their son's educational achievement.

## 2. SUGGESTED PARENT MEETING STRUCTURE

This is a suggested structure on how to hold the meeting with parents. You should adapt this to your needs and setting. The meeting can be between 1 to 2 hours , depending on your time availability.

- Welcome. Greet fathers, mothers and other caregivers to the meeting. If feasible, do a round of introductions with each parent saying their name and their child(ren)'s name and age.
- State the reason for the meeting.
- o Share the evidence and consequences. You can say something like, 'In our community, boys are facing many challenges to doing well in school, especially in higher education. Here is evidence that this is happening, and why we are taking initiative to address this issue.' Share relevant statistics from your education institution, from local departments of education, or global databases from places like UNESCO (https://uis.unesco.org/) that show gender differences in educational attainment such as in enrollment, school absences, and dropout in your setting. Share reasons why boys' disengagement has consequences for families using some of the reasons listed above in Pre-Meeting .
- o Encourage discussion. Ask parents what they are proud of in their boys. Ask if parents and caregivers have encountered challenges with supporting boys' education at home.
- Emphasize an asset-based approach to working with boys. Say that your school is taking an asset-based approach to working with boys, meaning your team acknowledges the strengths that exist within each boy to do well in school. Say that the school aims to nurture the resilience, kindness, and capacity of each boy and will engage them actively in their own learning.
- If you have time, do the 'Parent Group Reflection' exercise parents . See end of this resource.
- Introduce the initiative.
- o Say that the social environment around boys can potentially discourage them from achieving academically, reading, or pursuing diverse school activities that do not align with traditional expectations of what it means to be a boy or man.
- o Say the school will be implementing interactive and participatory activities to work with boys, girls, and their peers to look at how they can work better together in the classroom, build stronger friendships, support each other to do well in school, and promote gender equality.
- o Say what kinds of topics will be covered:
- Gender stereotypes (overly simplified ideas about how people should behave based on their gender) and how they cause harm to boys' educational attainment
- Address Bullying Behavior
- How to form better habits to support their education and lead healthy lives
- Building stronger communication skills
- How to have stronger and more positive peer and educator relationships
- o Explain that they might notice a change in their child's behavior because of the discussions in the classroom, community projects, and club activities.
- o Ask if they have any questions.
- Share further information. Emphasize the important role parents play in supporting their son's educational attainment. Pass out any relevant handouts with tips, recommendations, and other
- relevant resources (see a sample at the end of this Guide). Share contact information that parents can use to ask questions throughout the school year.
- Close the meeting. Share next steps and close.

## Parent Group Reflection

Objective: To help parents recognize and reflect on the pressures boys face in school to live up to limiting definitions of what it means to be a man, and how these norms shape their behavior, relationships, and emotional well-being.

Time Needed:

## Directions:

1. Ask parents: Close your eyes and think back to when you were 10 years old and try to remember how you were treated. What messages did you receive about how to act like a boy or girl in school? How did this influence your engagement in school?
2. After a few minutes, ask parents to share. Summarize what you hear.
3. Ask parents: What messages do boys receive about how they should act at school? What about girls? Get lots of responses. Write these on a flipchart or chalkboard.
4. Say that like girls, boys receive messages that both support their education and ones that discourage them from doing well.
5. Say that a lot of these messages have to do with the expectations society has of boys to be 'real men, ' (also known as 'gender norms'). Some messages about being a man are good (e.g. be a leader, be brave), but others can cause harm, especially if they discourage boys from doing well in school. For example, boys may be told that 'real men don't ask for help' or that 'school is for girls,' which can make them feel ashamed of studying, asking questions, or showing interest in subjects like reading or the arts.
6. Ask parents: What could be the impacts of these messages on your son's education? Get lots of responses and write these on a flipchart or chalkboard.
7. Conclude by saying that all boys and girls have the capacity to challenge these harmful expectations and to do well in school. Girls and boys alike are caring, compassionate, and have the potential to succeed academically alongside their peers.

## Outline for Parent Meeting 2: Sharing the Positive Impact with Parents and Caregivers

This meeting should be held towards the middle or end of the school year. Like with the first meeting, these meetings should be done in close coordination with the school management and educators who are involved in the initiative. Besides parents, you can invite wider parent teacher associations and committees, as well as representatives of the local education office to participate in this second meeting.

15 to 20 minutes

The meeting time can be between 1 to 2 hours , depending on your time availability.

## 1. PRE-MEETING PREPARATION

- Prepare evidence of positive impact. Consult learners and educators such as teachers about what they think are the biggest positive outcomes from the initiative to address boys' disengagement in education. You can ask them to craft stories, testimonials, art, and other demonstrations that can be shared during this parent meeting. You can even prepare a slideshow or short video so that parents can witness important moments in the classroom or club firsthand.
- Choose a convenient time and location . Usually, employed parents have more limited hours during the workday. To encourage more diverse participation, consider having in-person and hybrid options so that most caregivers can join.
- Send invitations and reminders through appropriate channels (e.g. physical invitations, through parent chat groups, email). Make sure to explicitly invite fathers and other male caregivers and explain why their presence is important to the success of the meeting.
- Assign roles and responsibilities . Initiatives to address boys' disengagement from education and promote gender equality should be supported institution-wide. Invite representatives from across school leadership and administration to take on roles during the meeting.

## 2. MEETING STRUCTURE

- Welcome remarks. Greet fathers, mothers, and other caregivers. Have members of school leadership and local education authorities open the meeting and explain the importance of the initiative.
- Brief description of the initiative and impact. Remind parents of the issues regarding boys' disengagement in education and its consequences. Give a brief overview of the main objectives and activities the school implemented to address boys' disengagement. Share any positive observations on the school environment, boys' engagement in the school, and more.
- Testimonials and stories from boys and their peers, and teachers.
- o Invite learners who you consulted in the Pre-Meeting Preparation  to share the positive impact the boys' education initiative had on themselves, friendships, and educational attainment.
- o Invite teachers to share how this initiative has influenced their teaching practices, relationships with students, and their observations of boys' engagement in the classroom.
- Parent feedback and discussion. Open the meeting for parents to ask questions about the boys' education initiative and any suggestions they might have to improve it for the next school year.
- If time is available, discuss continuing support for boys. Brainstorm with parents, learners, and teachers how parents and caregivers can continue supporting boys' education alongside their siblings during the long break (e.g. summer holidays) so that they are ready for the next school year.
- If time is available, discuss next steps and future plans. Share any plans on the part of the school or club to continue activities in the next school year. Invite learners, teachers, and parents to share ideas on how to improve the programme.
- Close the meeting.

## Keeping Parents and Caregivers Engaged Throughout the School Year

Keeping parents engaged in your educational institutions initiative can be done throughout the school year. Here are some tips for keeping them involved:

- Provide regular updates through written communication that is sent home with students, or through parent chat groups and newsletters.
- Organize sessions through the school or clubs where parents can learn how to support boys' time management, reinforce their responsibilities to do school work in a timely manner, and encourage a love of reading
- Invite parents to a classroom session so that they can observe sessions, and even engage in activities.
- Ask for fathers and other male caregivers such as grandfathers or respected members of the community to volunteer to participate in Boys' Clubs activities as mentors or facilitators.
- Invite parents to other sessions where learners can give testimonials about what they are learning and how it is helping boys' to succeed in school.
- Invite parents to participate in community activism where they can work alongside their children to spread awareness about gender equality and the importance of education.

## [TEMPLATE TO ADAPT] Supporting Your Son's Education at Home

## Why Your Support Matters

When boys know their parents believe in them, it helps them stay motivated, confident, and curious about learning. You do not need to be a teacher or spend money-just showing interest in your son's life and learning can go a long way.

## Simple Ways to Support Learning at Home

- Show Interest - Ask your son about his school day, what he's learning, and what he enjoys. Praise effort, not just results.
- Encourage Reading - Read together, talk about books, and let him see you reading too. Even short daily reading helps build skills. You can say things like 'Pick any book you're curious about I'd love to hear what it's about after. I'm going to sit and read mine too.'
- Encourage his diverse interests - It might be cooking, dance, sports, or building. Encourage him to be curious and pursue different interests. Say things like 'If you like dancing (or cooking, or drawing), that's amazing-go for it! Everyone should get to do what they love, no matter what others say.'
- Build Good Study Habits - Set up a quiet place for homework, create a routine, and break tasks into small steps. Say things like 'Let's figure out the best time for you to do your homework every day so you have time to relax and play too.'
- Support Friendships &amp; Emotional Well-being - Help your son navigate friendships, handle emotions, and build resilience by listening and guiding him positively. Say things like: 'It's okay to feel sad or frustrated sometimes. If something's bothering you with your friends or at school, I'm here to listen and help you figure it out. You don't have to handle it alone.'

## Encouraging Motivation &amp; Confidence

- Avoid Harsh Punishment - Instead, use clear expectations, consistent consequences, and encouragement to build self-discipline. Say things like 'I know you made a mistake, but we're going to talk it through and figure out what to do differently next time. You can always come to me.'
- Talk About the Future - Discuss his interests and how school helps him achieve his dreams. Show him role models who were able to use their education to discover an interesting career or a new passion.  who succeeded through education. Say things like: 'You've said you love fixing things-did you know engineers do that every day? School can help you get there. Let's learn more about what they do.'
- Praise His Strengths - Notice what he does well-whether in school, sports, helping at home, or being a good friend. Say things like: 'I saw how you helped your friend today-that was kind and thoughtful. That's just as important as getting good grades.'

## Stay Connected with the School!

- Attend Parent Meetings - Stay informed about his progress and talk to teachers, other parents, or local community groups connected to the school if you have concerns.
- Ask for Help When Needed - Schools have resources to support learning-do not hesitate to reach out. Say things like: 'I've noticed my son is struggling to stay focused on his homework-can we talk about how the school might support him? Or: 'Who can I speak with about extra help for my son in reading? I want to make sure he doesn't fall behind.'

Every small effort counts! Your involvement can help your son stay engaged, confident, and ready for success. For more support, contact [School Contact Information].
