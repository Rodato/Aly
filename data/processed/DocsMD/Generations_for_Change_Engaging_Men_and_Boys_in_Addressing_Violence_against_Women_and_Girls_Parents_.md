## Preface

Welcome to the Generations for Change curriculum, jointly developed by Equimundo and Terre des hommes Lausanne (Tdh), with support from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.

This innovative program centers a family approach to gender norms, healthy relationships within families, and positive parenting techniques. It engages with both parents and their young adolescents to reduce intergenerational violence and foster healthy, caring, and supportive relationships between parents and their children.

Although complementary methodologies, a separate curriculum is used for each target group (parents and youth), with two sessions together as a family. The parents' curriculum includes some sessions held with fathers and mothers separately and other sessions where fathers and mothers are engaging with the content together.

This curriculum has been adapted from Equimundo's 'Program P', which is named after padre and pai, the words for father in Spanish and Portuguese, respectively. Program P was originally developed to provide a direct and targeted response to the need for concrete strategies to engage men in active fatherhood from prenatal care through delivery, childbirth, and their children's early years. For this context and project design, the Program P methodology was adapted to include both mothers and fathers and have a focus on parents of early adolescents (ages 12 to 14).

## Activities

Each thematic unit contains a series of activities that have been sourced from selected training manuals from countries in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia and adapted, where relevant, to the Jordanian context and to address key issues identified during the formative research. The time needed for each of the activities and the activities' complexity vary to cater to the curriculum's potential use in diverse regions and settings within Jordan and with different stakeholders.

## Timing

Each activity in the curriculum has a suggested or anticipated length of time. These are general guidelines and can vary considerably based on several factors, including the facilitator's comfort with the material, how comfortable the participants are with each other (and thus willing to share), and how talkative the group as a whole is. Use your discretion and experience as a facilitator to adjust the timing as needed to make the group as effective as possible without exceeding the overall time allotted.

Each session is designed using a standardized format:

## Preparation for the Session

<!-- image -->

Objectives: The purpose of each session is indicated. Facilitators can inform participants of the purpose before starting a new session.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Participants: The groups will be either men and women separately, men and women together, or men and women together with their children. There may be an additional note about how group composition affects facilitation.

Key Activities and Timing: Each activity has a title, which facilitators may choose to share with the group. The activity's recommended length is also indicated but will vary depending on the number of participants and adaptations that facilitators will need to make in relation to the characteristics of the participants and the time available for training sessions/processes.

Materials: The materials required to facilitate the session are listed. Materials are optional for some activities.

Preparation: These are the steps that facilitators should take, well in advance, to prepare for the session. These steps should be completed prior to each session to save time and to ensure the activities flow smoothly.

<!-- image -->

Each session is structured in the following way:

## Welcome and Check-In

Checking in is a good way to start each new training session. It can be as simple as going around a circle and letting each participant briefly say who they are and how they are doing/feeling. Other areas you can cover when checking in are:

- If something new has happened for them since the previous session
- If they have taken any action since the previous session in line with the weekly commitment
- One word that describes their state of being
- Their reflection on the discussions so far

## Each Session Activity

- Key Message(s): The key message(s) of the activity are indicated. These key messages should be emphasized during and upon concluding the activity. The key messages are meant to conclude the conversation and be a natural link to what was covered in the session.
- Procedure: These are the steps for carrying out the activity. They may need some adaptation in different contexts. Facilitators should be attentive to whether the steps are appropriate for the participants they are working with.
- Group Discussion Questions: Most of the activities include group discussion questions to help guide the discus sion on the activity topic. These questions serve as guidance for facilitators. It is not usually necessary to discuss all the questions or to adhere to the order in which they are listed, and facilitators can use their best judgment on using them depending on the depth and direction of the conversation among participants.
- Facilitator Notes: These are tips for trainers in relation to specific aspects of the methodology and/or thematic content of the activity that may demand their special attention.

There is also direction about who will be in each session. Men and women will be together in eight sessions and separate in five sessions. I n the five sessions where men and women are separate, the facilitation is largely the same; however, there are some questions specified as 'for men' or 'for women.' Finally, in two sessions near the end where men and women will be together, the couple's children will also be present.

## Mindfulness Activity

Most sessions include a mindfulness activity. These activities are to help participants relax and destress and to give them a few moments of peace, acknowledging that everyone arrives carrying daily worries and, at times, difficult situations they are going through in their personal lives. Mindfulness activities can help participants center and open themselves to experience the session through the interaction with others, as well as process the session's activities and the emotions that may have been stirred up. Facilitate these peacefully and quietly to create a calming atmosphere.

## Weekly Commitment

At the close of most sessions, participants will be invited to explore and try carrying out one or more specific actions in line with that week's activities. These actions can help them incorporate the week's learnings into their daily lives and encourage them to share with their partner, children, and community. This is sort of the 'homework' of the curriculum. In the 'Welcome and Check-In' section each week, participants will be prompted to speak about how they completed their weekly commitment, if they were able.

## Closing and Check-Out

Checking out often entails the participants making a concrete commitment to actions they will take before the next session. Checking out-type exercises are already included in many activities, but it is always useful to end a session with participants making a clear commitment to doing something practical before the next session.

In the check-out exercise, you can also do a light debrief of the session to enable participants to share what they most liked (or not) about the activity and what they learned. This is also an opportunity to address any emotions that might still need processing before the end of the session.

## Energizers and Icebreakers

Some sessions will also include a prompt for an 'energizer' or 'icebreaker' activity. These are very short activities unrelated to session content in which participants will get up and move around. These activities help to relieve stress and tension, break up sessions with a lot of sitting or discussion, and add an element of physical movement to the session. A number of these activities are included in Appendix A at the back of this curriculum, but facilitators are encouraged to come up with their own if they would like and to modify existing ones to suit their own comfort and that of participants. Think about what you and others might enjoy or what you have done in groups with other facilitators and try those out. You might use a different one each time or find one that the group loves and come back to it regularly. Facilitators are encouraged to use these to help participants feel more comfortable in the space and whenever they feel the energy in the room is getting low.

## Guidance for Facilitators

First and foremost, you should see yourself as a facilitator, not a teacher. Rather than lecturing, ask questions to better understand  where  participants  are  coming  from  and  guide  them  in group reflections to critically look at harmful norms around masculinity. You do not have to be an expert in the topics you are discussing and do not need to have all the answers. Rather, the role of the facilitator is to create an open and respectful environment in which participants can feel comfortable sharing and learning from each other in a safe space.

The  facilitator's  role  is  to  promote  reflection  and  participatory learning  (recognizing  and  building  on  participants'  experience, knowledge,  and  strengths),  present  information  neutrally,  and create a horizontal learning experience in which the participants can learn from each other and from active participation in the activities. Other information to keep in mind includes being aware of your position of power, and accordingly, avoiding judgmental and authoritarian attitudes. Never impose your feelings or opinions on the group and do not aim to instill fear because participants may 'switch off' their emotions, interest, or engagement with the topic or feel paralyzed while participating. Always be conscious of the language you use and messages you present.

Many of the themes in this curriculum are complex and sensitive. During sessions, pay attention to the participants' comfort level. In some cases, you may need to refer individuals to professional services such as counseling to address mental health, child protection, or specialized support for survivors of violence. Before you facilitate any session, it is essential that you have a list of available resources for participants should they need additional assistance and that all facilitators are well versed in local laws on  minors'  rights,  confidentiality,  and  mandatory  reporting.  It is important to be aware of the practical realities of the group members' lives and understand that they may face challenges or dangers when trying to make changes.

Changing attitudes and behaviors is a long process. Participation in these activities will not necessarily lead to an immediate transformation of individuals' lives and relationships. However, it is a big step toward promoting personal change.

Before you begin, review your own views, assumptions, and prejudices, and avoid bringing them to the group. Be aware if men or women from particular social, cultural, or religious backgrounds trigger certain emotions in you, be they positive or negative, that may affect your own work in the group.

<!-- image -->

At the same time, there will be moments when it is appropriate  and  helpful  for  you  to  share  your  own  personal  opinions, thoughts, and values about a topic. If the session is discussing a gender-equitable perspective and the group doesn't seem quite on board, sharing your personal views can help open the door for change.

## Asking Questions

One of the most important things you will do as a facilitator is simply  ask  questions.  Doing  so  promotes  dialogue  and  opens new pathways for participants to explore the topics. To do so, see your group as a process. Ask 'process questions,' questions that cause participants to reflect more, cannot be answered with a 'yes' or 'no,' and are unbiased. See the following chart for additional tips:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Terre des hommes

Helping children worldwide.

There are many group discussion questions listed for each activity to help participants explore and understand the issues at hand. Use these questions as a guide for conversation, though, not a checklist. What is likely to happen is that some of the issues raised by the questions will come up organically in the discussion, in which case there is no need to ask again. Other questions may be answered by someone while they are answering a different question. Sometimes, a group member will ask others a question from the list without even knowing it. All of that is fine.

Overall,  you  want  the  discussion  to  feel  comfortable  and  natural  for  the  participants.  You  may  also  combine  or  reword  the questions to make more sense or to refer to something that was said earlier, which helps the question feel more relevant to the group. Sometimes, if it seems like a question is too sensitive for the group at that time, you may choose to skip it or save it for a future session.

The more you get to know your group and develop your experience as a facilitator, the more comfortable you will feel with the discussion questions. Just remember, the group is not students preparing for a test, and you are not a lecturer. You are a facilitator, and as such, are leading a discussion among friends.

## Tips for Successful Facilitation

The following are a number of useful tips to help you lead the group sessions. These tips will help you to encourage and create a respectful environment in which participants feel comfortable sharing their opinions and experiences, as well as listen to and learn from others.

Remember  the  group  agreements .  Ask  participants  to decide  on  a  set  of  agreements  and  remind  them  of  those agreements throughout the sessions. Important group agreements relate to listening to and showing respect for others (e.g., not talking when others are speaking, not making rude comments, or not talking on the phone), confidentiality, and participation.

<!-- image -->

Do not judge. Remember, you are here to facilitate discussion and reflection. Your role is not to teach or punish anyone. Be friendly and create rapport with your participants. Be aware of your own position of power - avoid judgmental and authoritarian attitudes. Never impose your feelings or opinions on the group.

Promote inclusion. Ensure that all participants have the opportunity to speak. Be careful not to let one person dominate the conversation or make other people feel that they cannot share their opinions. Encourage people to share their experiences and learn to identify when people want to speak but may be too shy to say something unless called on. If a participant begins to take over the group by spending too much time with a story, find an opening and kindly say, 'It sounds like you have a lot of valuable experiences to share with the group. That's great! Do others have similar or different stories they would also like to share?'

Address participants' concerns. The group meetings can serve as an important opportunity for participants to receive help and advice. As a facilitator, it is important that you validate people's concerns, but you can also engage the larger group in helping to propose solutions. Ask the group: 'How do you think this problem could be solved?' or, 'Has anyone faced a similar situation? What did you do?'

Know and use referral services. Some problems that participants face may require outside support. In addition, some participants may prefer to discuss a particular topic, obtain information, or seek support outside of a group setting, or they may need attention from a specialized service provider. As a facilitator, you should be knowledgeable about places where you can refer participants if needed.

<!-- image -->

Manage conflicts respectfully. If a conflict arises among the  group,  or  if  a  participant  shares  a  discriminatory  view, remind the participants of the group agreements. Encourage other members to help mediate the situation. Ask the group what they think about the question raised or how they would suggest handling the problem. When necessary, you can offer brief responses to questions and clarify misinformation.

Appreciate  honesty  and  openness. Encourage  participants to be honest and open. They should not be afraid to discuss sensitive issues for fear of ridicule from their peers. Thank the group members for sharing their personal stories. Never force anyone to participate in the activities. Instead, try  to  create  an  environment in which the participants feel comfortable.

Promote  movement  and  interaction. Include  as  much physical  movement as possible so that participants remain active, alert, and interested. You are encouraged to use short energizers  between  activities  in  order  to  keep  the  participants engaged in the topics you are discussing.

Manage your time. Keep  track  of  time;  do  not  spend  too long on a given activity or session. Keep in mind participants' attention spans and schedules.

Ask  for  feedback. Use  a  'check-out'  to  receive  regular feedback  from  participants.  What  do  they  like  and  dislike about the activities? What is working or not working? Use their  input  to  improve  the  sessions.  Do  not  divert  from  the planned activities but use feedback to improve the running of the sessions (for example, by including more energizers).

Be  respectful  in  your  presence  and  appearance. Try to be as respectful as possible in your appearance and your nonverbal  and  verbal  presentation.  This  includes  the  way you dress (avoiding clothes that distract) and address participants (work on remembering their names - a simple name game can help with that).

## Be careful of topics that may cause retraumatization.

Given  some  of  these  issues'  sensitivity,  it  is  possible  that participants will bring up personal experiences of violence, such as sexual trauma or abuse. Given mandatory reporting requirements for facilitators and staff (that is, requirements to report issues such as abuse and sexual assault when the participant is a minor), it is important that at the beginning of each session, you remind participants that they are welcome to  leave  the  room  if  they  feel  uncomfortable.  They  are  not required to share any sensitive information. This should be repeated at the beginning of particularly sensitive activities as well.

<!-- image -->

Also remind participants of the resources that are available to them and that you are available after the session to talk further. Do a warm referral (link with a specific person in a certain specialized service or offer to accompany the participant should they desire) of participants to service providers with whom they can discuss any issues they may be having. It  is  also  helpful  to  go  over  the  ground  rules  (group  agreements) about respecting confidentiality in the group setting, and the participants should also be reminded not to share any personal  information  that  they  do  not  want  to  be  revealed outside of the group.

Keep  discussions  from  straying  too  far  from  the  key messages . One of the main facilitator tools you can use is the 'bank,' also known as the 'parking lot.' While all discussions are welcome, if a participant brings up a topic that cannot be addressed within the time allotted, write it on a flipchart paper called the 'bank' or 'parking lot.' It is important that these topics are revisited at another time. However, if the topic is completely unrelated, say something like, 'That's a great comment. We don't have time to address that right now, but let's talk more about it after the session.'

## Be friendly and create rapport with your participants.

As a facilitator, you are not an authority figure. You are not sitting  in  judgment  or  giving  participants  grades  or  evaluations.  It  is  fine  and  even  encouraged  to  be  informal  with participants, call each other by first names, share personal details  (as  appropriate),  and  even  socialize  outside  of  the group setting. All of that builds the relationships that make the group effective. You are encouraged to share in the group examples from your life and your own struggles, challenges, and realizations. Doing so provides an example for the group and  helps  them  see  that  change  is  possible  and  what  the process of change looks like. You do not have to be perfect, just on the same path to personal growth that you are asking the participants to walk.

## Running Each Session

1

Review the session and guidance. Prior to each session, review the 'Materials,' 'Preparation,' and 'Facilitator Notes,' as well as the activity procedure. This will help ensure that you are prepared to facilitate each activity and will allow you time to gather additional materials and become more informed on the topic if necessary.

Prepare the space. When preparing the space, always arrange chairs in a circle for all sessions unless otherwise noted. During the sessions, it is recommended to offer participants some type of refreshment and engage in physical activity and motion. Beverages and food tend to be highly valued by participants and help them stay in the group process.

Check in at the beginning of each session. It is important to begin each session by warmly welcoming back the group and checking in. A check-in provides time for group participants to share any thoughts, personal experiences, and comments they had based on the discussion from the last session. Spend several minutes checking in prior to beginning the day's session. In order to have time for the session activities, keep check-ins brief, without responses or discussion - check-ins shouldn't be more than ten minutes.

Review the group agreements. Most of the sessions will ask group participants to share personal experiences. To create safe spaces for participants, at the beginning of every session, review the ground rules that were established by the group in Session 1. This promotes trust and confidentiality within the group.

Carry out the session - but be flexible and creative and contextualize activities. Each activity contains procedures to take the group through activities and group discussion questions to prompt critical reflection. The structure proposed in this manual for implementing activities should serve as a general guide; it is not necessary to apply it verbatim. Facilitators can change the order of certain activities' elements or alter the listed examples to make them more relevant to their group's reality and to reflect their own knowledge and skills. If the topics and examples presented in these activities come across as too abstract or removed from your reality, you can add in examples from your daily life and experiences. This will help participants to be emotionally involved and identify more closely with the material. Sharing personal experiences also helps to model the behavior you want from the participants in your group. Be careful, though, not to stray too far from the curriculum, as this can prevent you from reaching the sessions' objectives.

Use icebreakers and energizers. Icebreakers are short activities that help participants build trust in the group, usually in a lighthearted way. They are a great way to open a session, allowing participants to move around, share, and become comfortable with one another. Energizers are short activities that are most helpful when the group appears to have low energy, be losing interest, or not be responding to the activity. These help to change the routine, get people in motion, and relieve fatigue and boredom. They take only a few minutes. Be conscious of gender dynamics. If the group is mixed gender, prepare energizers that take into consideration physical contact and body movements that might not be welcomed by the group.

Keep group discussions open-ended and among participants. Group discussions can be the most important part of each activity. These discussions are opportunities for participants to reflect on what they've been doing, talk about their thoughts with one another, and think critically about how to see changes in their own lives. It is important for facilitators to make sure that conversations remain open, judgment-free, and comfortable. Try and get the group to talk to one another rather than having one-on-one conversations with whoever is leading the facilitation.

'Check out' at the end of the day. End each day with a one-word 'check-out' that emphasizes some of the key messages or lessons that they learned during that session. Use this time to reflect on the main conclusions of the day, to announce the next activities, or to see what can be improved and what worked well, for example.

## Facilitating Mixed Groups

## Participant Dynamics

Many of  the  sessions  are  designed  for  men  and  women  together, and in two sessions, their children will also be present. These sessions are designed to engage participants in critical reflection and to promote dialogue between men and women. This methodology has taken a gradual approach to joint sessions and starts with men and women participating in separate sessions. This is done to make sure that both men and women feel comfortable enough to express their ideas and opinions, particularly on issues that may be sensitive to discuss in front of their partner. Starting in Session 5, men and women participate in sessions together, by which point they will hopefully feel  more  comfortable  communicating  with  each  other  and sharing  their  opinions  in  front  of  participants  from  the  other sex.

Be  aware  of  family  and  gendered  power  dynamics. The  fathers  in  the  group  may  be  used  to speaking on behalf of their partners and children, but in our groups, we want  to  make  sure  everyone  can speak freely.  If  fathers  or  boys  are trying to speak on behalf of women and girls, or interrupting them, gently thank them for their enthusiasm but say that in the group we want to make sure everyone can share their own  stories.  You  can  even  refer back to the group agreement about making 'I' statements - that every participant should speak from their own knowledge and experience and not speak on behalf of others. As  the  facilitator,  you  will  need  to demonstrate  and  model  paying  attention  to  women  and  girls  when they speak as well. Whenever they are talking, look at them and listen carefully  to  what  they  are  saying. If you are looking away or not fully paying  attention,  that  sends  a  signal  to  men  and  boys  that  women's voices are less important.

<!-- image -->

In  mixed sessions, you may see a range of power dynamics  being  exercised,  especially  by  men,  including  many  of  those  we  are  trying  to  positively  change through the curriculum! Here are a few tips that may be helpful:

Pay  particular  attention  to  interruptions  and  side  conversations. In general, men and boys are far  more  likely  to  interrupt  women and girls than the other way around. When men and boys interrupt, step in,  ask  them  to  please  wait,  and then turn your attention back to the original  person  speaking.  This  also applies  when  men  and  boys  interrupt other men and boys. Men and boys  are  often  more  likely  to  have side  conversations  or  take  phone calls when someone else is speaking. When that happens, pause the conversation  and  ask  those  being disruptive  to  stop  and  rejoin  the group.  You  can  also  remind  them about  the  group  agreement  that only one person speaks at a time.

Depending  on  who  is  in  the room,  participants  may  be  less willing  to  share  openly. For  instance,  women  may  be  less  comfortable  speaking  freely  in  front  of their  spouse,  and  children  may  be less comfortable speaking freely in front of one or both of their parents. When  these  groups  are  together, don't pressure individuals to share, but  you  can  give  them  additional time to think about their answers to the questions or to write down and reflect on their answers without the expectation that those answers will be shared. Feel free to modify your approach  in  those  activities  based on how you see the participants responding.  Another  way  to  address this is, where appropriate, to break participants  into  family  groups  to discuss.  Women  and  children  may be less comfortable speaking about their  spouse  or  father  in  the  large group  but  may  be  able  to  speak openly when they are just speaking with  family  members  or  even  in  a small group with one other family.

## Facilitating Mixed Groups

## Facilitator Dynamics

The mixed sessions in the curriculum are designed to be facilitated by two facilitators, ideally one male and one female. While this always depends on the availability and skills of facilitators in your community, some of the sessions ask to separate men and women and recommend that these groups be facilitated by just a male facilitator (for the group of men) or just a female facilitator (for the group of women). This allows a bit more comfort during those sensitive conversations.

<!-- image -->

When facilitating with one female facilitator and one male  facilitator,  it  is  important  to  make  sure  that  facilitators are modeling gender-equitable relationships. That means that you both are demonstrating the types of communication and shared decision-making that you are  encouraging  the  participants  to  undertake.  Some items to be careful of include:

Facilitators should be dividing the work evenly. That means that one facilitator is not conducting all the sessions or doing most of the work. Activities should be divided evenly by facilitators (either by alternating the lead role of facilitation for every other activity or for every session).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Be careful that female facilitators are not the only ones taking notes or that male facilitators are not the only ones leading the group discussions. This can inadvertently send the impression that male facilitators are more valuable than their female colleagues. Be sure to share these roles.

Remember that the reverse is also true. If a female facilitator is leading all the discussions and a male facilitator is sitting back and not participating, it can give the impression that he is not in agreement and is less invested in the group. The facilitator not leading should remain attentive and engaged with the group at all times, not looking off into space or checking their phone.

Ensure facilitators are comfortable with one another and have a good working relationship and communication.

Make sure facilitators don't interrupt or cut one another off; they should consider validating or reflecting upon what the other facilitator is saying, when relevant, to build on their colleague's points and model constructive and collaborative dialogue. Again, modeling the type of behavior you wish to see in participants is very important.

<!-- image -->

Emphasize that facilitators should practice with one another before the session and divide up roles and activities well in advance. If you are unsure about whether your facilitation team is modeling gender-equitable relationships, the team can practice in front of a colleague or a supervisor and get feedback from others.

## Tips for Creating a Safe Space for Participants and Responding to Sensitive Discussions

Most of the sessions in this curriculum include reflective conversations about possibly sensitive topics. As a facilitator, it's important to foster a safe space for the participants to share their thoughts and emotions. Make sure you are actively and empathetically listening without judging or interrupting the participants' stories. Do not pressure anyone to share, but be sure to allow participants to talk about what the exercise evokes for them, promote reflection, and highlight the key messages of the exercise. If any participant shares any painful experiences, is deeply moved, or cries, you can implement any of the following recommendations as you see fit 1 :

Don't judge. This isn't always easy but set aside your own opinions to focus on the other person's perspective. Recognizing the participant's views and emotions will help them feel heard and understood. This doesn't mean you have to agree with everything the person says - it's about letting them know you care.

Give the person your full attention. Pay attention with your gaze, your body language, and a warm tone of voice. Maintain eye contact, nodding and giving other cues as appropriate to show you are paying attention, without interrupting. Giving your full attention shows respect, and a person is more likely to remain calm when they feel respected.

Listen carefully (feelings and facts). Actively listen to the words and experiences participants describe - as well as the emotions reflected in their tone of voice, body language, and other cues - to go beyond words and identify emotions. Listen with your heart, gaze, voice, and ears.

Don't be afraid of silence. Sometimes, all a person needs is to be heard or to know you are there. The person may be thinking about what they are going to say next or may need a few moments of silence to restrain their emotions. Let the person finish speaking before offering a few words of support.

Say thank you. Express appreciation for the participants' openness and confidence in sharing their experiences or for being vulnerable. Comment that many of us have had painful experiences with our parents and being able to recognize them can help heal.

Consider sitting next to the distressed person. You can hold their hand or rest your hand on their back if appropriate in the context, or you can ask the person if they want to go out and get some air and accompany them if there is a second facilitator.

Repeat and paraphrase. Ask questions to confirm and validate experiences that have been shared. Refer to the person's words: For example, 'I heard that Ahmed felt humiliated when his father insulted him. Is that right?' Keep a respectful and nonjudgmental attitude and give the person time to respond. Remember that there is no script for empathic listening. Respond based on the person, the situation, and the moment.

Resist the temptation to give advice. Limit yourself to listening, validating the experience, being grateful for it having been shared, and looking for common ground with the other participants.

Follow up. Between sessions or at the beginning or end of the next session, approach the participant who had been emotionally affected, ask how they have been, and suggest other times to meet if necessary or consider offering information about psychological support services if they are still distressed. (See the following guidance on responding to disclosures.)

## Responding to Disclosures Related to Violence or Mental Health

Some problems that participants may be facing, such as mental health issues, substance abuse, or violence, may require outside support. In addition, some participants may prefer to discuss a particular concern, obtain information, or seek support outside of a group setting, or they may need attention from a specialized service provider. As a facilitator, you should be knowledgeable of, and always consult, the Tdh referral protocol to ensure you do not put the person at risk and inform your Tdh supervisor if you are unsure of how to handle a particular problem. Inform the participant and others in the group that specialized services exist in the community to help people who live with violent partners. It's important to have up-to-date information on support services.

Use the following guidelines to respond to disclosures of violence or  other  sensitive  issues  that  might  require  external,  specialist services. Please always consult with a Tdh supervisor and use the specific Tdh protocol.

During a session, if a participant discloses a painful life experience or a woman mentions experiencing violence from a partner or family member, you can sit with the participant, listen closely and with empathy, and offer to talk after the session. Be sure to avoid pressuring the participant to talk about their experience in front of the group. Ensure that the group listens with attention and extreme respect. At the end of the session, you can reach out to the participant and ask how they are feeling, validating their experience and feelings. You can also ask whether they would like support and offer to connect them with specialized services.

It is important to establish if the participant is currently at risk of violence or if this is a story of past violence. If the incident of violence was recent or it seems like they are still at risk, consult the relevant Tdh protocol for referrals. If the incident of violence was in the past, practicing empathy and active listening is very important to ensure the participant feels heard and validated.

## If the person discloses an experience of violence, it is important to follow these steps:

Listen to the participant closely and with empathy and validate their experience and concerns without judging. Tell the person clearly that they are not responsible for the violence suffered. Affirm that the violence they experienced is not their fault and violence is never justified.

Show the participant that you care for them and about the experience they have gone/are going through.

Help the person regain a sense of calm, feel supported, and feel connected to others that can help them.

Encourage them to remember their agency and strength, and remind them that help is available. Support them in whatever decision they make, without pressuring them. Always respect the participant's choices and decisions and maintain confidentiality by not sharing the information they disclosed. Protect the identity and safety of the survivor. Do not write down or share any personally identifying information about a survivor or their experience.

Remember that survivors have the right to decide to whom they want to tell their story and if they want to receive support.

Become familiar with the resources available locally and have a printed copy available with the names and contact information of centers that offer specialized services for survivors of violence, including health, psychological support, legal, and child protection services. Consult the relevant Tdh protocol on how to properly refer to someone without placing them at risk.

Ask the participant if they are interested in contact information for these services. If they are, share the relevant information with them, assuring them that it does not contain any revealing information on what types of services these contacts offer. Refer to the relevant Tdh protocol on how to refer a person while ensuring their safety.

## Generations for Change - Parents Curriculum

If the person is interested in receiving the support of specialized services, provide accurate, up-to-date information about survivor-centered services available in their area and inform your contact at the local center that a participant will be looking for help or information. Never force or pressure a survivor of violence to disclose or access services if they don't want to.

Evaluate if there is a current or ongoing risk of extreme violence.

Discuss the case with your supervisor.

In the next session, ask how they fared after the session and during the week.

If the disclosure of violence occurred within the larger group, carefully remind the group of the agreements on re- spect and confidentiality.

## Actions to avoid when working with a participant who discloses violence:

- Attempting to solve their problems
- Convincing them to leave the violent relationship
- Convincing them to go to the police or to court
- Asking detailed questions that force them to relive painful experiences
- Asking them to analyze what happened and why
- Pressuring them to reveal their feelings
- Blaming them for the violence
- Disrespecting their agency and choice

These actions can do more harm than good. 2

## If a man discloses using violence against his partner:

Do not allow the group to make light of the issue or make jokes.

Remember that in cases of disclosure of violence, it is essential to respect confidentiality. Ensure that all group members are aware that what is shared in the group should not leave the group, as it is critical to guarantee the se- curity of the victims. All disclosures of violence should be discussed with supervisors but never with members of the community. Any follow-up action should be decided between the facilitators and their supervisor. If the disclosure occurred within the group, ensure that everyone follows the rules on confidentiality and respect.

Remember that exemptions to the principle of confidentiality apply only if a participant reveals that they will harm another person or themselves or when someone's bodily integrity or life faces an immediate risk.

2 Adapted from World Health Organization, UN Women, &amp; United Nations Population Fund. (2014). Health care for women subjected to intimate partner violence or sexual violence: A clinical handbook. http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/136101/ WHO\_RHR\_14.26\_eng.pdf?sequence=1

<!-- image -->

## If a participant reveals their intent to harm another person:

Speak with your supervisor to determine whom to contact to help the person in danger and connect them to any available resources in the community that can provide support.

Make a connection: Give the person in danger information about organizations where they can receive help. If the individual decides to go, call a contact in the organization and let the contact know that someone will be seeking support and ask them to receive the person warmly.

Inform your supervisor immediately after the session so they can take any necessary action.

Men's groups should not be considered an appropriate place to share details about violence against women. This could reinforce patriarchal ideas that legitimize violence. In such cases, the focus should be on how to manage anger and violence, on the harm that can be caused, on men taking responsibility for their actions, and on ensuring that potential survivors are not in danger.

Terre des hommes

## If a participant reports severe mental health issues:

If a participant requires specialist support, having disclosed suicidal thoughts or demonstrated severe depression during a session, acknowledge this disclosure in the moment and create a plan to talk individually with the participant. When the session ends, give them information on where they might go to seek support and discuss the case with your supervisor. Remember that facilitators are not the participants' counselors or therapists.

## Materials:

- Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)
- Sticky notes
-  A  Participant  Journal  for  each  participant (session uses Journal Resource Page 1.1, 'My Family in Five Years')
- Copies of pre-test survey for all participants

## Preparation:

Before the first group session, it is important that you as a facilitator understand the difference between a traditional teaching style (in which  the  teacher  or  facilitator  is  above  the participants)  and  the  group  education  facilitation style (in which the facilitator and group members are equals).

- Make sure you have reviewed the details and questions  in  the  session  and  have  gathered your materials.
- Arrange the space so that it is inviting and equitable. There should be no desks or tables if possible,  and  chairs  should  be  arranged  in  a circle. The facilitator's chair should be part of the  circle.  There  can  be  a  break  in  the  circle to place the flipchart easel or to put flipchart papers on the wall.

Literacy Note : This activity requires some literacy/writing ability, so be aware and mindful of  participants'  levels  of  literacy.  If  you  feel one or more group members will struggle, explore  alternative  ways  for  them  to  complete the activity.

## Part 1: Welcome and Pre-Test

(25 minutes)

1. Welcome participants to the group as they arrive and introduce yourself. If there are snacks or drinks available, encourage them to go ahead and take something.

2. Thank them for coming and record each person's name and information on the intake sheet/attendance log.

3.  Once everyone has arrived (or enough time has passed), ask participants to sit down and tell the group:

'Welcome and thank you for coming! We are very happy that you accepted our invitation to participate in this group meeting. The purpose of this group is to create a space for parents of adolescent children to meet, discuss, and learn from each other.'

'This program was designed by Terre des hommes Lausanne (Tdh) and Equimundo. Throughout this program, you all will go through a variety of topics about parenting adolescents that can help strengthen your family relationships, improve how you communicate with each other and deal with stress and other difficult emotions, create a vision for your family, and support you in using discipline in a way that can help your children develop in a healthy way.'

'We know parenting can be hard sometimes, especially as your children turn into teenagers. This group is meant to provide you with some tools and support to make that transition a little easier. During our meetings, we will discuss how men and women can work together as supportive and respectful partners and parents to improve the well-being of our children and our families.'

4.  Tell  participants  that  before  you  start,  the  program  asks them to take a short survey asking about some of their attitudes, beliefs, and practices. It is important that they are as truthful as they can be on this survey because it will give us a good picture of who is in the room and what tailored support you can provide as facilitators.

5. Provide the surveys to the participants and have them fill them out. For low-literacy  groups,  be  sure  to  find  an  alternative delivery strategy (reading aloud, working one on one with a facilitator, etc.).

<!-- image -->

## Part 2: Introductions (20 minutes)

1. After you have welcomed everyone to the session, explain that you would now like everyone to introduce themselves to the group. Go around the circle, asking each person to introduce themselves by sharing the following information:

Their name

Their child(ren)'s name(s) and age(s)

One thing they enjoy about being a parent

One thing they find challenging about being a parent

Facilitator  Note:  Use  your  own  notebook  or  a  piece  of paper (not the flipchart) to write down the participants' names and the information about them as they introduce themselves. This will help you remember who they are and  details  about  them  more  quickly.  Also  write  down their answers to the questions about what they enjoy and what they find challenging, as this can help you support them and customize aspects of the curriculum to participants as you go along. Explain to them that you are taking notes on important points they make and things you don't want to forget but emphasize that everything they share will be kept confidential.

2.  After  each  participant  has  introduced  themself,  tell  the group:

'Over the next few months, we will meet once per week for a  total  of  13  meetings.  In  each  session,  we  will  explore  a different topic together, and sessions will include interactive activities and group discussion. Eight of the sessions are designed for men and women to participate together and five sessions, including this one, are designed for men and women to be separate.'

3.Ask the group if they have any questions about the group sessions.

## Part 3: Energizer (5 minutes)

Select an energizer or icebreaker from the back of the curriculum, or use one you like, to help participants get to know each other and get comfortable in the space.

## Part 4: Group Agreement

## (15 minutes)

1.  Explain  that  in  this  activity,  the  group  will  discuss  and come  up  with  group  agreements  that  will  promote  a  safe space in which they can find honesty, trust, and support from each other.

2.  Ask:  'What  would  help  you  feel  safe  and  comfortable enough to come every week, discuss, and share in this group? What would you like this space to be, and what behaviors and attitudes would you appreciate from everyone?'

Facilitator Note: You should write down the list of agreements on a flipchart paper. Remember that these need to be visible in every session. The following box has a list of several recommended agreements. If these are not mentioned first by the group members, recommend that they be included.

3. After a list of agreements is created, ask: 'Is there anything missing that you would like to add?' Make any additions to the flipchart list that are suggested.

4. After the list is complete, ask all group members: 'Does everyone  agree  to  this  list  and  commit  to  upholding  these agreements during our sessions?'

Facilitator  Note:  If  someone  does  not  want  to  commit, ask  them  why.  Ask  the  group:  'Are  there  alternative agreements that you would feel more comfortable with?' Suggest that the agreement be changed or removed, depending on the desires of the group.

Important Group Agreements for a Successful Group

## Privacy and Confidentiality:

- The privacy of personal experiences must be secure. No one  should  discuss  the  private  information  shared  in  the group with others in the community if the person recounting the experience does not want it to be shared. All personal stories and experiences that are shared in the group will remain in the group.
- However, participants are encouraged to share any knowledge or lessons they have learned in the sessions with others outside of this group, such as friends, family members, and neighbors.

## Equality:

- All members of the group are equal, irrespective of age, background, or any other characteristics. All members have a voice and the right to speak, share, and contribute.
- All members are responsible for their own actions and behavior. Every member takes responsibility for what they do.

## Respect and Empathy:

- Speak one at a time. Allow each person the time to speak. Everyone's viewpoint is important, and we need to make sure that everyone is heard. Listen and show interest in what others have to say.
- Practice  empathy.  Imagine  yourself  in  the  other  person's position  and  try  to  understand  how  they  feel.  Respect  the opinions of others and try not to judge others for their experiences or opinions.
- Every member should actively participate  and  contribute to the group. Use only 'I believe,' 'I think,' or 'I have experienced' statements. Do not assume that your viewpoint is shared by everyone else in the group.
- Commit to attending all the sessions and to being on time.

Share the Key Message: 'Creating group agreements will  help  everyone  to  feel  comfortable,  safe,  and  respected within this group. The agreements will remain in place for the duration of the group sessions. It is everyone's responsibility to follow them and encourage others to follow them.'

## Part 5: Sharing Expectations

(20 minutes)

1. Put up two flipchart papers on opposite sides of the room (if possible). Write at the top of one 'Hopes and Excitement' and at the top of the other 'Concerns and Fears.'
2.  Ask  participants  to  think  for  a  few  minutes  about  their hopes or things they are excited about, and their concerns or fears, regarding the group and program. Pass out sticky notes and markers and ask them to write applicable statements for each of the flipchart papers. Have them stand up and place the sticky notes on the corresponding flipchart papers when they are done writing.
3. After a few minutes, read the 'Hopes and Excitement' paper  and  ask  if  anyone  has  any  comments  or  anything  they wrote that they would like to elaborate on. Then, do the same with the 'Concerns and Fears' paper.
4. Once you have discussed, mention some of the hopes and things they are excited about that you believe will be met by the group, and note any that you don't think the group will be able  to  meet  for  whatever  reason.  Then,  address  concerns and fears, alleviating as many as you can. If there are any that require one-on-one follow-up after the session, ask whoever wrote it to speak with you or another facilitator privately after the session.

Thank the group for sharing, and give the Key Message: 'Sharing our hopes and excitement is an important first step toward making positive changes in our lives and relationships. Through our discussion, we can develop realistic expectations of what will be accomplished during our time together. Knowing each other's desires for this group will also enable us to better help each other with the problems we are facing.'

Facilitator Note: It is likely that there will be some expectations or topics that will not be covered during the group sessions. To set realistic expectations, explain to the  group  that  although  some  of  their  expectations  or desires may not be directly discussed during the group meetings,  they  should  use  the  group  and  its  members as an opportunity to seek advice, discuss important matters, or learn from each other. Along with the content of the program, it will also be important to establish what the program will not provide to the participants (i.e., employment, financial assistance, food beyond the session, etc.).

<!-- image -->

## Part 6: Program Overview and Topics (10 minutes)

1. Tell participants:

- 'This program will cover some, but probably not all, of the  topics  you  raised  when  we  discussed  your  expectations. Some of the key things we will cover include…'
- o 'We will discuss what it means to be men and women in our society today and how that affects us personally as spouses and as parents.'
- o 'We will talk about how we have learned to be spouses and parents. And together, we will celebrate our joys and try to overcome our challenges.'
- o 'Some of those challenges we will discuss and try to address are expressing our emotions, dealing with anger and conflict, and the effects of violence on our lives.'
- o  'We  will  talk  about  and  develop  skills,  especially around communication and conflict resolution, that will help us understand ourselves, our spouses, and our children better, and in turn, help us improve as individuals, spouses, and parents.'
- o  'Finally,  we  will  work  with  our  spouses  and  children to craft a vision and plan for our family's future. We will talk about what we want and need, what challenges we may face, and how to achieve our vision for a happy and healthy life together.'

## Part 7: (Optional) Case Managers Explain Referral Services

## Part 8: My Family in Five Years

(20 minutes)

Facilitator Note: For this activity, we are asking participants to imagine themselves five years in the future. This may bring a sense of hopelessness or anger depending on the situation. You can modify the activity to have participants think about one year in the future instead. The purpose of this activity remains the same: to envision the types of relationships they would like to have with their families and what needs to change in order to achieve those goals.

1. Pass out the Participant Journals to each person and ask them  to  open  their  journals  to  Journal  Resource  Page  1.1 ('My Family in Five Years').

2. Explain:

'For the time we are together, we are going to keep a partial record - in any way we want - of our experiences, thoughts, and learning. In your journals, you will have sheets related to different activities we will be doing, as well as blank pages for you to write or draw about your reflections and experiences in the group. This journal can be used any way you desire. Please bring this journal every week so it can be a cumulative record of your experiences. If you prefer that the journal be kept safe, we can store it in a locked cupboard and you can have it every time we meet.'

3. Explain: 'In this activity, each person will think about the goals they have for their family. Toward the end of the program, we will be joined by some of your family members and revisit this exercise and, together with them, you will create a shared vision for the future.'

4. Ask the participants to close their eyes. Read the following statements aloud slowly so that the group members can consider each sentence as you read it.

## 'Imagine it is five years from now…'

- 'What are the things you hope to have achieved in that time?'

'What do you hope for yourself? What do you hope for your partner and for your children?'

- 'What  do  your  relationships  with  your  partner  and your children look like?'
- 'How do you care for each other? How do you help each other?'

'How do you speak to and listen to each other?'

5.  Ask  the  participants  to  keep  their  eyes  closed  and  think about this vision for the future and what it looks like and how it makes them feel.

6.  After  a  few  minutes,  ask  the  participants  to  write  down or draw an image or an object representing their vision for their family.

7. After everyone has had a few minutes to write or draw, ask everyone to come back together.

<!-- image -->

8. Ask the group:

How did it feel to develop your vision for your family? Do you think others in your family share the same vision? Why or why not?

9.  After  the  questions,  ask  if  anyone  wants  to  share  their family vision with the group. Allow enough time for participants who want to share their family vision to do so. Remember, sharing is not required.

10. Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas.  Tell  them  they  will  return  to  this  vision  later  in  the program.

## Part 9: Weekly Commitment

(2 minutes)

Tell the participants that at the end of each session, you will be asking them to do something at home to bring the lessons learned in the group to their families. For this session, ask the participants to speak with their partner about their partner's family  vision  and  discuss  any  similarities  or  differences  to what they thought and wrote down in the session. Tell them that the next session will start by sharing voluntarily about how their conversations went.

## Part 10: Closing and Check-Out

(5 minutes)

1.  Thank  all  participants  for  sharing  their  questions,  concerns, thoughts, and expectations.

2.  Express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.

3. Explain that you will use all questions posed and expectations shared to further inform and shape the coming sessions.

4. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.

1 Thank all the narticinants for comina to the second session.

Facilitator Note: Part 2 ("Man Box, Woman Box, Human

Box") could be seen as trying to "redefine" what it means.

## Part 1: Welcome and Check-In

(10 minutes)

1. Thank all the participants for coming to the second session.

2. Explain that at the beginning of each session, there will be a 'check-in,' where participants will have an opportunity to share how they are and any feedback they have had since the last meeting. Explain that sharing is voluntary and is not required if someone does not feel comfortable or want to do so.

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session?

Did you talk to anyone about the family vision you wrote last  session?  How  did  that  go?  Did  you  learn  anything about your partner's vision?

3. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.
4. Remind the participants about the group agreements that were established in Session 1 and say that these agreements will be referred to throughout today's conversation to make sure this is a safe and respectful place.

Facilitator Note: You can use check-ins as an opportunity to gently remind participants of the group agreements. For example, if one of the agreements was to be respectful,  encourage  everyone  to  listen  while  the  others  are speaking. This can include practicing empathy by trying to imagine themselves in the other person's position and not judging their ideas or experiences.

<!-- image -->

## Part 2: Man Box, Woman Box, Human Box (75 minutes)

Facilitator Note: Part 2 ('Man Box, Woman Box, Human Box') could be seen as trying to 'redefine' what it means to be a man or woman. Depending on the participants' views,  this  could  create  backlash  under  the  argument that  the  program  is  trying  to  disrupt  natural,  religious, or cultural doctrine. The questions toward the end of the exercise about the consequences of staying in the Man Box or Woman Box might elicit such comments. It will be important to continuously assess the group to see their comfort level with the conversation and to what extent you can explicitly challenge current gender stereotypes and roles. The remainder of the curriculum will implicitly foster this conversation, so if the group does not want to discuss changing norms, this exercise can be used as an introductory reflection on the socially assigned roles and characteristics of men and women.

If you receive backlash against gender equality, especially  from  men,  you  might  want  to  explicitly  address  the benefits  of  gender  equality.  You  can  ask  the  following questions, which might elicit responses on the negative effects of gender discrimination and the positive impact of gender equality - particularly for men and boys:

1. What is the harm that women face from gender inequality?
2. How are men benefiting from gender inequality?
3. What is the cost to men of gender inequality?
4. How would women benefit from equality?
5. How would men benefit from equality?

For  the  last  question,  here  are  some  possible  answers to draw from:

- Reduced stress and burden on the man - specifically,  relieving  psychological  stress  through  shared  decision-making  (men  may  be  described  as  'clothes  hangers' that take on the burden of everyone's problems)
- Dual income leading to economic stability and growth for the family structure
- Healthier relationships with family members and modeling gender-equitable behavior while raising children
-  Peace  and  prosperity  at  the  society  and  community levels (commonly, Rwanda is discussed as an example of where gender equality in parliament has led to a stronger and safer society and economy), not only the individual-level benefits
- Communal and long-term benefits for the family and society versus individual, selfish, and short-sighted benefits for the man

- Although there are more immediate benefits, gender equality also benefits future generations. If people model equality for their children, these children will grow up believing in it and fully benefit from it.
1.  Divide  the  participants  into  two  groups  and  assign  one group 'Man' and one group 'Woman'.
2.  Give each group a flipchart paper, a marker, and the following instructions. Give them 20 minutes to complete the following activity.

<!-- image -->

## 'Man' Group

-  Draw  a  big  square  on  the  flipchart  paper  for  your group. Label the square 'Omar's Box.' The box should be almost as big as the paper, but a bit smaller so you are able to write items outside the box. Brainstorm a list of what society expects from Omar when they tell him to 'act like a man.' Place this list inside this square, or 'box,' on the flipchart paper.
- Place characteristics that our society labels 'not acting like a man' on the flipchart paper outside the box.
- After filling the areas in and around the box, take 2 or 3 extra minutes and circle the items on the flipchart paper that directly relate to men's roles as fathers.

<!-- image -->

## 'Woman' Group

-  Draw  a  big  square  on  the  flipchart  paper  for  your group. Label the square 'Aisha's Box.' The box should be almost as big as the paper, but a bit smaller so you are able to write items outside the box. Brainstorm a list of what society expects from Aisha when they tell her to 'act like a woman.' Place this list inside the square, or 'box,' on the flipchart paper.
- Place characteristics that our society labels 'not acting like a woman' on the flipchart paper outside the box.
- After filling the area in and around the box, take 2 or 3 extra minutes and circle the items on the flipchart paper that directly relate to women's roles as mothers.

<!-- image -->

Facilitator Note: The items on the lists that the groups present may vary. Some common examples, however, include having physical strength, earning money, and not showing emotion in the Man Box and being emotional, being talkative, and having physical beauty in the Woman Box.

## Use the following Group Discussion Questions to explore the groups' work:

-  Where  do  these  messages  come  from?  Who  is  the messenger? Do the messages differ if they come from a  man  or  a  woman  (mother,  father,  teacher,  sibling,  or peers)?
- What are the differences between the two boxes? Are they opposites of one another? How so?
- What are the advantages for Omar if he stays in the Man Box and for Aisha if she stays in the Woman Box? (For  example,  men  who  stay  in  the  Man  Box  may  be well-respected  by  other  men.  Women  who  stay  in  the Woman Box may find it easier socially if they get married.)
- What are the disadvantages for Omar and Aisha if they stay in the Man Box or Woman Box? (For example, men may feel constant pressure to provide or feel depressed that they cannot comply with all aspects of the Man Box. Women may be unable  to  get  work  outside  the  home even though they would like to.)
- Are there any advantages for Omar and Aisha to stepping out of the box? What are they? (For example, having more open communication between partners and/or more peaceful households because each person is part of the decision-making process.)
- Do you think that expectations for how men and women  should  look  and  act  are  different  today  than  when your parents and grandparents were growing up? How? Why?
- Do these expectations of roles influence the way that boys and girls are raised?
- Is it hard to live up to these expectations of being a man? Being a woman?
- How do these different expectations of how women and men should act influence our relationships with our partners?
- How do these different expectations of how women and men should act influence our roles as parents and how we interact with our children? Are there moments when, as parents, men must do things on the 'women's' list and women do things on the 'men's' list?

3. Make another box on a new piece of flipchart paper. (This should be done with all the participants.) Label this box the 'Human Box.'

4. Explain that there are many positive characteristics inside the Man Box. In fact, much of the 'empowerment' work done with women is to create the conditions that give them the skills, voice, and agency over the decisions that affect their lives - capabilities that are traditionally seen as 'masculine' in patriarchal societies. Examples of this might include being a leader, having a career, becoming involved in politics, and being active in decision-making.

5. Ask the participants to point out the positive qualities of the Man Box. Write them inside the Human Box.
6. Explain that there are also many positive characteristics inside the Woman Box. Examples might include spending time with  children,  expressing  emotions,  being  affectionate  and loving, and playing an active role in domestic chores.
7. Ask the participants to point out the positive qualities in the Woman Box. Write them inside the Human Box.
8. Remind the participants of the items that were circled that the participants felt directly related to mothers' and fathers' roles. Point out how many of these items are now in the Human Box.
9. Referring to the Human Box, explain that these are all social characteristics. That is, these are roles or characteristics that we usually associate specifically with men or women but can be done by both women and men. These constitute our gender. Gender is how we are socialized - that is, how our attitudes, behaviors, and expectations are formed based on what society associates with being a woman or being a man. We are not born with these characteristics but learn them as we grow up.
10.  Note  that  social  characteristics  differ  from  biological characteristics, and ask participants to name some biological characteristics of men or women. (Example: Women can give birth; men can grow beards.) Explain that the biological characteristics of women cannot be given to men, and vice versa, and those are what constitute our sex. Sex is biological - we are born with male or female reproductive organs and hormones.

<!-- image -->

11. Tell the group that is it very easy to confuse gender with sex. Explain that gender is constructed by our society. Society assigns certain attitudes and behaviors to individuals based on their sex - for example, that women care for children and men work outside the home - and every individual is influenced by these social expectations. These social expectations based on sex do not remain the same but change over time.

## Close the activity with the following Key Messages:

- 'A person,  regardless  of  their  sex,  can  be  any  combination  of  characteristics  inside  the  Human  Box.  Such decisions should be based on their personal choices as individuals  and  human  beings,  not  forced  upon  them based on their gender.'
- 'When we aspire to the ideals of the Human Box, we are changing the question from 'How should a man or a woman act?' to 'How should a human being act?''
-  'Similarly,  we  can  also  change  the  discourse  from 'What  are  the  things  that  a  mother  or  a  father  should do?' to 'What are the things that a parent should do?''
- 'Although being outside of the Man Box or the Woman Box will lead to some of the positive things we discussed, it is not going to happen all at once.'
- 'Staying  in  the  Man  Box  or  the  Woman  Box  can  be harmful,  and  we  should  continue  to  think  of  ways  to break out of this box to be truer to ourselves.'
-  'Although  there  are  biological  differences  between men and women, many of the differences we attribute to men and women are constructed by our society. These differences are not part of our biology - we are not born this way - but we learn that this is how we are expected to behave. We learn these characteristics from family members, friends, cultural and religious institutions, and school.'

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Balloon Play. During this exercise, they'll be working with a partner to keep their balloon from hitting the ground.
2. Have the participants get into pairs and spread out around the room so they have space around them. They should stand face to face. Hand one person in the pair a blown-up balloon.
3. Tell the participant with the balloon to throw it to the other person, who will hit it back, explaining that the goal of the game is to keep the balloon in the air as long as they can.
4. Begin, reminding participants that the point of this exercise is to have fun and to really focus on the task at hand.

## Part 4: Weekly Commitment

(5 minutes)

Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'During the next week, do one thing that is outside of your gender box that you have not done before or do not usually do. Come to the next session ready to discuss how it felt to do this and what feelings it brought up for you.'

(10 minutes)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.

2. Ask the group: 'Does anyone have a fun parenting story to share? Something successful you did, something funny your child  did  or  said,  or  something  they  did  that  you  are  proud of?'

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session?

Did  you  talk  to  anyone  about  the  issues  discussed  in the group?

3. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.
4. Remind the participants about the group agreements that were established in Session 1 and say that these agreements will be referred to throughout today's conversation to make sure this is a safe and respectful place.

## Part 3: My Parents' Legacy (65 minutes)

1. Explain to the group that they will do an activity to reflect on the influence that their mothers and fathers had on them as children growing up. Tell them that in the activity, they will think about how they can learn from the positive aspects of their parents in raising their own children and how to avoid the negative aspects so that they do not happen again.

<!-- image -->

Facilitator  Note:  This  activity  can  have  a  serious  emotional  impact  on  participants  and  facilitators  because violent experiences or other traumatic life events, such as  abandonment,  may  be  recollected.  Therefore,  it  is important  to  give  the  participants  emotional  support during this process. Generally, this can be achieved by respectfully listening to the participants without judging or pressuring them.

## Section 1: Our Fathers' Impact

3.  After  2  minutes,  ask  the  group  to  open  their  eyes. Tell them to turn to the person sitting next to them and explain the object or smell they identified. Ask them to share  how  it  relates  to  their  father  or  main  male  role model  from  their  childhood.  Give  them  5  minutes  to share.  At  the  end  of  the  activity,  ask  for  volunteers  to share their experiences with the group.
2. Ʊ 1. Tell the group that first, they will think about the influence their fathers had on them. Ask everyone to close their eyes and think about an object or smell that they associate with their father. This object could be a tool, a book, a set of car keys, or a strap used for punishment; the smell could be that of their cologne or a particular food. If  they  did  not  have  or  did  not  know  their  father, ask  them  to  think  about  any  important  male  figure  in their life, such as a grandfather, uncle, older brother, or teacher. 2. Tell the group to spend a few minutes focusing on the relationship between the object or smell that they identified  and  a  moment  or  memory  that  they  shared  with this man. What emotions does this object or smell recall for them?
4. As each person shares their story, thank them for having the emotional strength to share with the group.

Once everyone has finished sharing, thank participants once again  for  the  trust  they  have  in  the  group.  Then,  read  the following statements out loud:

Terre des hommes

Helping children worldwide.

## The  men's  group  facilitator  should say:

- 'One thing that my father did that I have already repeated or want to repeat with my children is…'
- 'Something about my father that I have not repeated or do not want to repeat with my children is…'

Then, ask participants to turn to the person sitting next to them and share their thoughts about these questions, working in pairs. Give the pairs 10 minutes to discuss.

<!-- image -->

## The women's group facilitator should say:

- 'One thing that my father did that I want my husband or partner to repeat with our children is...'
- 'One thing that my father did that I do not want my husband or partner to repeat with our children is…'

Then, explain that each person should think about these two statements, imagining how they would like themselves and their husband or partner to behave in raising their children. Ask them to share their thoughts with the person  sitting  next  to  them.  Give  them  10  minutes  to share.

## Section 2: Our Mothers' Impact

- 2 1. Next, ask everyone to close their eyes again and think about  an  object  or  a  smell  that  reminds  them  of  their mother.  Explain  that  if  they  did  not  grow  up  with  their mother, they can think of another woman who was important to them during their childhood - an aunt, grandmother, older sister, etc. 2.  Tell  the  group  to  spend  a  few  minutes  focusing  on the object or smell that they associate with that person. What emotions does this object or smell recall for them? 3. After 2 minutes, ask the group to open their eyes. Tell them to turn to the person sitting next to them and explain the object or smell and how it relates to their mother or main female role model from their childhood. Give them 5 minutes to share.

## Generations for Change - Parents Curriculum

Once everyone has finished sharing, read the following statements out loud:

## The  men's  group  facilitator  should say:

- 'One thing that my mother did that I want my wife or partner to repeat with our children is...'
- 'One thing that my mother did that I do not want my wife or partner to repeat with our children is…'

Then, explain that each person should think about these two statements, imagining how they would like themselves and their partner to behave in raising their children. Ask them to share their thoughts with the person sitting next to them. Give them 10 minutes to share.

<!-- image -->

## The women's group facilitator should say:

- 'One thing that my mother did that I want to repeat with my own children is...'
- 'One thing that my mother did that I do not want to repeat with my own children is…'

Then, ask participants to turn to the person sitting next to them and share their thoughts about these questions, working in pairs. Give the pairs 10 minutes to discuss.

Part 4: My Experiences as a

Parent (30 minutes)

1. Explain to the participants that this activity will help them

After 10 to 15 minutes, open the discussion using the following  Group  Discussion  Questions.  Remember  that  sharing  is voluntary!

<!-- image -->

## For the men's group:

-  How  do  you  think  traditional  definitions  of  what  it means to 'be a man' affected your father, how your father cared for you, and the way you care for your children? (Some examples: Men cannot cry; men should not express physical affection with sons, such as kissing or hugging; men don't care for babies; men are responsible for providing economically and protecting the family; they use violence if necessary to defend their honor and to resolve conflict.)
- How do you think these beliefs affected our mothers?
- How can you 'leave behind' harmful practices to be more involved fathers?
- How do traditional definitions of what it means to 'be a woman' impact the ways that women are raised and cared for? (Some examples: Women are responsible for raising  children  and  doing  domestic  work;  women  are weaker.)
- What do you expect of your wife or partner as a mother?

<!-- image -->

## For the women's group:

-  How  do  you  think  traditional  definitions  of  what  it means to 'be a man' affected the way your father cared for you, and how does it impact the way your husband or partner cares for your children? (Some examples: Men cannot  cry;  men  should  not  express  physical  affection with sons, such as kissing or hugging; men don't care for babies; men are responsible for providing economically and protecting the family; they use violence if necessary to defend their honor and to resolve conflict.)
- How do traditional definitions of what it means to 'be a woman' impact the ways that women are raised and cared for? (Some examples: Women are responsible for raising  children  and  doing  domestic  work;  women  are weaker.)
- What do you expect of your husband or partner as a father?

<!-- image -->

## Generations for Change - Parents Curriculum

<!-- image -->

## Questions for both groups:

- How can couples work together to be the parents that they want to be for their children?
2. Ask participants to turn to Journal Resource Page 3.1 ('My Parents' Legacy') and answer the first two sets of questions on their own. Give participants about 5 minutes to do so.
3.  Thank  the  participants  for  sharing  their  experiences  and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the Key Message:

'Who  we  are  today  was  shaped  by  our  experiences growing up.  But  those  experiences  do  not  have  to  determine who we will become in the future. Reflecting on our own past enables us to identify the aspects we want to leave behind and those we want to reinforce and enables us to make positive choices for the future by replacing negative attitudes and behaviors with positive ones. By working together and discussing their expectations as parents, men and women can support each other in being the best parents they can be.'

## Part  4:  My  Experiences  as  a Parent (30 minutes)

1. Explain to the participants that this activity will help them to reflect on their experiences of being parents - what they love about it and what makes it worthwhile, as well as what some of their concerns or stresses are.
2.  On  a  flipchart  paper,  write  'Happiness.'  Ask  the  participants, 'What are the things that make you happiest as a parent, that bring you joy and make you appreciate your children the most?' Write their answers on the flipchart paper.
3.  After  about  5  minutes  or  when  most  people  have  had  a chance to speak, turn to another paper and write 'Worries.' Ask: 'What are some of the things that concern you as a parent or cause you stress?' Write their answers on the flipchart paper.
4.  As  the  participants  are  sharing  their  worries,  ask  if  any of the other participants have any advice or experiences to share. You can ask the group, 'Who would like to share their experience on how they were able to resolve this issue?' or 'What do people think about this comment?'

## For the men's group:

- How did it feel to hear about the concerns and experiences of your peers?
- Have you ever spoken to anyone else about the worries or concerns that you have as a parent? With whom did you share them?
- Why do men talk so little about their concerns about fatherhood? How often do you speak with your partner about being a parent?
- How can we make it easier for men to talk about being fathers and receive information?
- Are any of the worries or anxieties that you have about fatherhood influenced by societal expectations on what it means to 'be a man'?
- Are there things you would like to do as a father but haven't because you feel you would be judged?
- What do you think can be done to support men to be the fathers they want to be?
- How important is communication between parents for raising happy children?

- How often do you speak to others about the worries or concerns that you have as a parent? With whom do you share them?
- Are any of the worries or anxieties that you have about parenting influenced by societal expectations on what it means to 'be a woman'?
- What do you think can be done to support women to be the mothers they want to be?
- How often do you speak with your partner about being a parent? Do you wish you spoke about it more often? What can be done to increase communication between partners about parenting?

<!-- image -->

## Generations for Change - Parents Curriculum

5. Thank the participants for sharing their ideas and experiences. Share the Key Message:

'Being  a  parent  is  usually  one  of  the  most  fulfilling, joyful experiences a person can have. Because we love our children so much, though, parenting can also be a stressful experience for many reasons. Celebrating your joys and sharing your worries and concerns with others - and with your partner - can help to alleviate some of this stress and find solutions together with other people in your lives, when needed.'

## Part 5: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Senses. During this activity, you will be giving them a raisin (or date/piece of candy) and guiding them through their senses while giving the object all their attention.
2. Give the participants a raisin (or date/piece of candy).
3. Read the script:

<!-- image -->

Holding: First, take a raisin and hold it in the palm of your hand or between your finger and thumb.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

(If in a wrapper) Hearing: Unwrap the candy and listen very carefully to the sounds it makes as you take it off. Try to block out all of the other sounds you may be hearing in the room.

Seeing: Take time to really focus on it; gaze at the raisin with care and full attention-imagine that you've just dropped in from Mars and have never seen an object like this before in your life. Let your eyes explore every  part  of  it,  examining  the  highlights  where  the light shines, the darker hollows, the folds and ridges, and any asymmetries or unique features.

Touching: Turn  the  raisin  over  between your fingers, exploring  its  texture.  Maybe  do  this  with  your  eyes closed if that enhances your sense of touch.

Smelling: Hold  the  raisin  beneath  your  nose.  With each inhalation, take in any smell, aroma, or fragrance that may arise. As you do this, notice anything interesting that may be happening in your mouth or stomach.

<!-- image -->

Placing: Now slowly bring the raisin up to your lips, noticing how your hand and arm know exactly how and where  to  position  it.  Gently  place  the  raisin  in  your mouth; without chewing, noticing how it gets into your mouth in the first place. Spend a few moments focusing on the sensations of having it in your mouth, exploring it with your tongue.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Tasting: When you are ready, prepare to chew the raisin, noticing how and where it needs to be for chewing. Then, very consciously, take one or two bites into it and notice  what  happens  in  the  aftermath,  experiencing any waves of taste that emanate from it as you continue chewing. Without swallowing yet, notice the bare sensations of taste and texture in your mouth and how these may change over time, moment by moment. Also pay attention to any changes in the object itself.

Swallowing: When you feel ready to swallow the raisin, see if you can first detect the intention to swallow as it comes up, so that even this is experienced consciously before you actually swallow the raisin.

Following: Finally, see if you can feel what is left of the raisin moving down into your stomach, and sense how your body as a whole is feeling after you have completed this exercise. 3

## Part 6: Weekly Commitment

(5 minutes)

Explain  the  Weekly  Commitment:  'Over  the  next  week, please reflect on the last questions in Journal Resource Page 3.1:  How  would  you  like  to  be  remembered  as  a  spouse? How would you like to be remembered as a father or mother? What can you do today to ensure that happens? If you feel comfortable doing so, discuss some of these questions with your spouse, children, or other family or friends.'

2. Ask the group: 'Does anyone have a fun parenting story to share? Something successful you did, something funny your child  did  or  said,  or  something  they  did  that  you  are  proud of?'

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

## How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session? Did  you  talk  to  anyone  about  the  issues  discussed  in the group?

3.  Ask  participants  about  last  week's  commitment  to  think about how they would like to be remembered and the legacy they would like to leave behind.

4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## Part 2: Expressing Emotions

(45 minutes)

1.  Divide  participants  into  pairs  and  give  each  pair  one  (or two, if  there  are  enough)  of  the  cards  on  which  you  wrote different emotions before this session. If you are able to give two to each group, make sure they are not too similar. (For instance, don't give the same group 'happy' and 'content.')

2. Explain to the participants that these are the emotions being discussed in this activity, and they will be thinking about how difficult or easy it is to express these emotions.

3. Tell the pairs that they will act out the emotions on their cards, with other participants trying to guess what they are acting out. They will have a few minutes to prepare with their partner first.

<!-- image -->

4. Give each pair a few minutes to prepare how they will act out  the  emotions  on  their  cards,  and  then  give  each  group a chance to act theirs out. Have the rest of the participants guess  what  emotions  are  being  expressed,  calling  out  as soon as they know. When someone finally guesses the emotion being expressed, write it on the flipchart so at the end you have a list of all the emotions from the activity.

5.  Provide  an  opportunity  for  participants  to  add  any  other emotions that may be common but that haven't been acted out.

## Ask  participants  the  following  Group  Discussion Questions  (each  person  should  pick  one  or  two emotions from the list to discuss):

- To what extent do you feel these emotions?
- Are there any emotions up here that you feel judged for expressing?
-  Who  do  you  see  expressing  these  emotions  in  your family or community most often? Why do you think that is?

6. Discuss the similarities and differences among the participants' answers in terms of what emotions are easy or hard to express, which are socially acceptable for different groups, and who expresses different emotions.

7. Explain that there are some emotions that we have learned to express well or sometimes even over-express. Others we have learned to contain and not express as much, even hiding them sometimes. Some may fall in between these areas.

## Ask  the  following  additional  Group  Discussion Questions:

- Why do people express some emotions and contain other ones? How do they learn to do this? What are the consequences of over-expressing or containing emotions for long?
- How do men and women express their emotions differently? Are there any similarities?
- How do men's and women's expression of emotions relate to the Man Box and Woman Box that we discussed in Session 2?
- How do friends, family, society, and the media influence the way men and women express themselves?
- Is it easy to express emotions to friends and family? Your partner?
- Do we sometimes take for granted that our partner and children know we care about them, and do we forget to express love and caring with them? How can we do more of that, even as our children get older?
- In your opinion, how do you think you can better express your emotions in a way that promotes your well-being?

Part 3: What Do I Do When I

Am Angry? (30 minutes)

1. Explain to participants:

## Read the following Key Messages :

-  'Different  emotions  reflect  different  needs,  and  it's best  to  learn  how  to  handle  our  emotions  in  our  daily lives.  The  ability  to  express  emotions  without  causing harm to others can make us stronger and helps us deal better with the world around us. The ways in which we express our emotions differ from one person to another, yet some conflicts may arise, especially when it comes to raising boys. For example, it's common for men to hide their  fear  and  sadness  even  toward  their  children.  It's common to express these emotions through anger and violence. And as boys grow older, we often express love and  affection  toward  them  less  than  when  they  were young, even though they still need it just as much.'
-  'Even  though  you  are  not  responsible  for  what  you feel, you are responsible for how you handle your emotions. It is important to differentiate between 'emotion' and 'behavior' and to work hard at expressing emotions without causing harm to ourselves and to others.'

## Part 3: What Do I Do When I Am Angry? (30 minutes)

1. Explain to participants:

'Now that we have thought about our emotions generally, we are going to explore one of them, anger, more deeply. Many people,  especially  many  men,  confuse  anger  and  violence and think they are the same. It is important to emphasize that anger is a natural emotion, and everyone feels it throughout their lives. Violence is a behavior in which anger is expressed. However, there are other ways to express anger - better and more positive ways than violence. If we learn how to express our anger when we feel it, it will be better than leaving it to accumulate, which often leads us to explode in frustration.'

2. Explain to the group that this exercise aims to discuss the ways in which people express their anger.

<!-- image -->

## Generations for Change - Parents Curriculum

3. Direct participants to Journal Resource Page 4.1 ('What Do I  Do When I Am Angry?'). Read all the questions to all participants and ask them to answer them individually for a total of 5 to 7 minutes. For low-literacy or illiterate groups, ask the questions  out  loud  and  have  the  participants  discuss  them with each other in smaller groups or draw what they think.

4. While the participants are thinking and writing, write the following two things (one each at the top of a flipchart paper):

<!-- image -->

## Negative ways to interact with others when we are angry

Positive ways to interact with others when we are angry

<!-- image -->

5. Call the participants back together and ask them to share their answers and ideas first on negative ways and then on positive ways. The participants will likely share some of the following positive ways:

<!-- image -->

- Taking deep breaths
- Counting to ten before you speak or act
- Using words to describe what we are feeling without harm
- Going for a walk alone, or in some way distancing ourselves from the situation or the person we are angry with, to calm down

6. Explain to the group:

'An angry person can take deep breaths, go for a short walk, or any other physical activity to calm themselves down. Generally, the angry person should mention to their partner or the person they are arguing with that they are going for a walk, saying something along the lines of, 'I'm really angry at you, and I need some fresh air. I need to walk a little bit so I won't feel violent or start screaming. When I calm down, we can discuss the problem together.''

'Another example for dealing with violence is expressing ourselves without insulting others. This entails explaining why we are angry and how we wish to solve the problem without insulting or hurting others. For example, if your partner is late coming home, you can either scream, 'You're an inconsiderate fool; you always do the same thing and I stand here waiting for you!' or you can express your anger without insults and say, 'I'm angry because you are late. Next time you're late, please let me know before or call or text me instead of leaving me waiting.''

7.  Provide  the  participants  with  the  following  scenario  and ask them how they would address the situation in real life. At the end of this conversation, the participants should be using some of the nonviolent strategies that you have discussed:

'You're a father, and your child is growing up. He's now 14. You're walking in the street, and someone tells you that your son is smoking. And you go to school and find out that your son skipped out on school to smoke. As you walk back from the  school  to  home,  you  are  very  angry  and  thinking  about your next steps. How would you deal with this problem?'

## Ask the following Group Discussion Questions:

- It is difficult for many people, especially men, to express anger without using violence. Why is that?
- Are there any people you can look to as role models to learn from about how we express emotions like anger in healthy ways?
- We generally know ways to avoid a conflict or a fight without using violence. Why don't we apply them more often?
- Think back to the positive ways we discussed to interact with others to reduce the tension in conflicts. Have you used any of these approaches before? Do they work?
- Is it possible to use words without insults when we are angry? How can we be better at that, especially in moments when we are stressed or having a difficult time with something?

Read  the Key  Message: 'Anger  is  a  natural  emotion that  everybody  experiences  throughout  their  lives.  The problem is when some people manifest or act out their anger through violence, thinking that violence is an acceptable way to express anger. Yet there are other, more positive ways to express anger. Learning to express our anger is considered better than bottling it up inside and not expressing it because if these feelings accumulate, they will result in an eruption of anger at a later stage.'

## Part 4: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Deep Breathing.
2. Ask everyone to get in a comfortable position either standing, sitting in a chair, on the floor, or lying down.
3. Ask the group to close their eyes and focus their attention on their  breath,  particularly  on  inhaling  and  exhaling.  They should observe how the breath enters and leaves the body. Ask the group to notice what happens to their stomachs as they are breathing - you want the stomach to expand as you inhale more air and contract as you exhale it.

4. Tell them to breathe in slowly through their nose for 3 seconds, hold for 1 second, and breathe out through their mouth for 4 seconds. Do this several times until they feel relaxed (about five times).

5. Explain to the group that deep breathing helps us to calm down, relax, and focus. If they are ever feeling strong emotions - fear, anxiety, nervousness, anger - taking a few deep breaths and focusing on their breathing can help. This type of deep breathing increases the amount of oxygen that enters the bloodstream and improves the functions of nerves that control the heart rate, which can reduce anger, anxiety, and stress.

## Part 5: Weekly Commitment

(5 minutes)

Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'Pay close attention to your emotions  this  week.  Which  emotions  are  you  comfortable expressing?  Which  emotions  are  difficult  to  express?  How often  when you express anger, especially with those close to you, is it really a manifestation of something else, such as sadness, frustration, or fear? And don't forget, you are doing your best. Struggling with these issues is not an admission of weakness but an expression of strength and hope.'

## Preparation:

Since  this  is  the  first  session  with  men  and women  together,  the  facilitators  of  the  two groups should speak beforehand to share notes  and  reflections  on  how  the  two  different  groups  have  progressed  so  far  and  any thoughts or concerns they have about combining the groups.

Facilitators should also talk about their respective styles and review the session together to talk about how they will jointly facilitate in a way  that  demonstrates  gender  equality  between them.

Some  participants  may  be  uncomfortable  in a group with their partner. Endeavor to make everyone comfortable during this first session together, do not push too hard if anyone is reluctant to speak or answer questions, and be watchful  about  any  concerning  dynamics  between partners. The facilitators should debrief together  after  the  session  to  discuss  how  it went and discuss what they can learn for future joint sessions.

Facilitators should also be prepared to support participants  because  strong  emotions  may arise (or be just below the surface) as the two groups come together and as men and women talk about their lives together. Remember the guidance about referral pathways, and be prepared to refer participants as needed.

Literacy Note: This activity requires some literacy/writing ability, so be aware and mindful of  participants'  levels  of  literacy.  If  you  feel one or more group members will struggle, explore  alternative  ways  for  them  to  complete the activity.

1. Thank all the participants for coming.

2.  Note  that  this  is  the  first  session  that  men  and  women are attending together, and ask everyone to introduce themselves. Some men may want to introduce their partners, but make sure that each person introduces him- or herself. Have the  couples  go  together  so  that  first  one,  then  the  other, shares their name and one of their favorite things about their partner.

3. After the introductions, do a fun energizer of your choice with  all  participants.  Choose  something  fun  that  everyone can participate in.

## Part 2: Sharing Our Group Agreements (20 minutes)

1.  The  facilitators  from  each  group  should  hang  the  two groups' agreements next to each other so everyone can see them.

2. First, ask one of the women, and then one of the men, to present their group agreement. Facilitators should note the similarities and differences.

## Ask the group the following questions:

- Is everyone in agreement about following both group agreements when we are meeting together?
-  Is  there  anything  you  would  add  for  when  we  are meeting together?
- Are there any elements of either agreement that anyone would propose we modify while we are meeting together to ensure a positive experience for everyone?

Facilitator  Note:  If  any  additions  or  changes  are  proposed, make sure that the whole group is in agreement. Be aware of group dynamics: for instance, if a man proposes a change or addition and other men agree to it, but the women in the group are silent or seem not to agree even if they do not speak up.

<!-- image -->

## Part 3: Our Lives Apart and Together (30 minutes)

1. Ask participants to turn to Journal Resource Page 5.1 ('Our Lives  Apart  and  Together')  and  tell  participants:  'We  all spoke in the last session separately about our parents and a little bit about growing up and our lives today. Today, we will make the connections even clearer between our past, present, and future.'

2. As they are looking at Journal Resource Page 5.1, tell participants they will be working together with their partner on the resource page: 'This 'Y' is a life history calendar and will help illustrate your lives together. On one of the top parts of the 'Y,' write down four or five important life events that happened before you met your partner. Each top arm of the Y is your individual path until you met. Then, on the bottom part of the 'Y' that is solid, write another four or five important life events that have happened since you met your partner.'

3. Give participants 5 to 10 minutes for this. Then, tell them: 'Each couple should pair up with another couple. Then, each couple should share their life history calendar with the other couple. What are the things that are individual to you, and what are the important milestones you share?'

4.  Give  participants  about  10  minutes  for  couples  to  share their life stories by narrating the highlights of their journeys with each other. Then, bring the group back together. Tell participants: 'You will notice that the bottom half of the 'Y' has a dotted line to signify the future. There will be life events, both good and bad, that you will share in the future. You have some control over that future, and many things will happen over which you don't have control, but you can always choose how you deal with and react to things that happen to you. We talked earlier in the program about our family visions, and this is the place where we want to make our futures aligned with our hopeful visions.'

## Preparation:

As this is the second session of mixed groups, some  participants  may  still  be  uncomfortable in a group with their partner. Endeavor to make everyone comfortable,  do  not  push  too hard if anyone is reluctant to speak or answer questions,  and  watch  out  for  any  concerning dynamics  between  partners.  The  facilitators should  debrief  together  after  the  session  to discuss how it went and what they can learn for future joint sessions.

This  exercise  aims  to  help  participants  understand  the  gendered  dimensions  of  power, specifically  that  men  generally  have  and  use power  the  most  in  society  -  far  more  than women - whether it is in the family, business, government, or elsewhere. However, even as men  may  wield  power  over  others  (such  as their  family  members),  they  may  have  diminished power in other spheres of their life: for instance,  due  to  nationality,  refugee  status, employment status, and/or skin color. So, men can be powerful in some ways and powerless in other ways at the same time. And in those areas where they are powerful, they are privileged above those who do not have power.

One goal of the exercise is to help men realize their power and help illustrate that sharing that power with those who have less power (such as their spouse and children) is beneficial for everyone  involved.  It  brings  more  voices  and perspectives  to  bear,  distributes  and  relieves responsibility and the pressure that goes with it,  and  leads  to  better  decisions  that  can  be supported by more people.

1. Thank all the participants for coming.

2. Ask the group: 'Does anyone have a fun parenting story to share? Something successful you did, something funny your child  did  or  said,  or  something  they  did  that  you  are  proud of?'

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session? Did  you  talk  to  anyone  about  the  issues  discussed  in the group?

3. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

Facilitator  Note:  Based  on  the  experience  of  Session 5,  facilitators  should  remind  participants  of  the  group agreements  once  again.  For  example,  if  one  of  the agreements  was  to  be  respectful,  encourage  everyone to listen while the others are speaking. This can include practicing  empathy  by  trying  to  imagine  themselves  in the  other  person's  position  and  not  judging  their  ideas or experiences.

<!-- image -->

1. Separate the participants into a men's group and a women's group for this exercise.

2. Explain to each group that in this activity, they are going to explore what power is and how it impacts the lives of men and women.

3.  In  each  group,  ask:  'What  does  'power'  mean  to  you?' Allow the participants to exchange their ideas and opinions.

<!-- image -->

4. Next, ask the participants to close their eyes and think of a memory of a time they felt powerful.

5. After a minute, ask the participants (with their eyes still closed) to think of a memory of a time they felt powerless.

6. After a minute, tell the participants to open their eyes. Tell the group that participants will now have an opportunity to share some of their experiences. It is an important opportunity to remind the participants of the ground rules, particularly of confidentiality and empathy, but also of the importance of participation.

7. Ask the group: 'How does it feel to be powerful?' Allow the  participants  to  share  how  being  powerful  feels.  Ask  if anyone would like to share their experience with the group or explain what situations make us feel powerful. Note that sharing is not required, only voluntary.

8. Next, ask the group: 'How does it feel to be powerless?' Allow the participants to share how being powerless feels. Ask if anyone would like to share their experience with the group or explain what situations make us feel powerless.

Facilitator  Note:  The  following  information  can  help  to explain feelings of beingpowerful or powerless.

Feeling powerful can feel like being:

- In control
- Big
- Knowledgeable
- Strong
- Brave
- Happy

Feeling powerless can feel like being:

- Small
- Fearful
- Without any control
- Unwanted
- Not confident
- Sad

9. Bring the groups together and have a volunteer from each group debrief their group's general reflections (not attributing comments to a specific person for anonymity purposes). After the participants have shared different examples, explain that power can be positive or negative depending on a person's own experience.

10. Explain to the group that there are four types of power. Read out the names of the four types of power (if available, you can write the four types of power on a flipchart paper):

- Power over
- Power to
- Power with
- Power within

11. Ask the participants to share their ideas about what each of the four types of power mean, and where possible, to provide an example.
12. After the group has had a chance to share their ideas and examples, read the definitions of each type of power to the group:

Power to means the beliefs and  actions  that  individuals and  groups use to create positive change. This kind of power is behind the concept of empowerment. 'Power to' enables a person to gain control  over  his  or  her  life. An  example  would  be  an individual  teaching  another community member about how to grow products, such as mushrooms.

Power within means power that lives within an individual.  It  is  a  personal  strength and uniqueness based on self-acceptance  and  self-respect, which in turn extends to respect for others and acceptance of others as equals. It  is  different  than  'power to'  in  that  it  refers  to  individuals  finding  strength  and positive change within themselves, while 'power to' refers  to  strength  and  change for other individuals.

Power over means the power  that  one  person  or group uses to control another person or group. An example would be the culture giving a man power and that man using it to control the members of his family.

Power with means the power  that  we  have  when two  or  more  people  come together to do something that they could not do alone (power  together).  This  is  a collective  sense  of  empowerment,  through  organizing and  uniting  for  a  common purpose  or  common  understanding. 'Power  with' is experienced  when  a  group comes  together  to  work  to tackle common problems, such as access to latrines or creating community centers.

13.  Give  each  couple  one  of  the  following  brief  scenarios. Ask each couple to discuss with each other who in the scenario is exerting power over another person and how they are exerting  their  power.  Then,  the  couple  should  recreate  the scenario as a more equitable one that involves more positive kinds of power being employed.

<!-- image -->

## Using 'Power Over' Scenarios

1. A 14-year-old girl is getting married despite her objections and her mother's concerns.
2. A husband comes home late and demands food to be ready for him when he arrives.
3. A mother-in-law sometimes knowingly contradicts a woman's instructions to her children.
4. A woman has to constantly ask her husband for the money to cover basic household expenses.
5.  A  man  frequently  makes  decisions  affecting  the  whole family without discussing them with, or even telling, his wife.
6. When children in the family do poorly on a test, they are beaten or have to go without dinner that day.
14. Give the pairs 8 minutes to discuss.
15. After 8 minutes, ask everyone to come back to the larger group.
16. Ask for a few volunteers to share their thoughts about the scenarios and how positive power can be used to improve the situation.

Thank  the  volunteers  for  sharing,  and  then  ask some of the Group Discussion Questions:

- Did you notice any similarities or differences between the examples that were shared?
- In what ways are men powerful?
- In what ways are women powerful?
- Is there a difference in how men use power and how women use power?
- How might children feel powerless? How can parents help their children feel less powerless?
-  Who  normally  has  power  in  society?  Who  normally does not have power?
- What are some of the ways that our society promotes or  supports  relationships  in  which  some  people  have power over other people?
- Are there times when power and authority are exercised over us by institutions or groups of people rather than individuals (such as in healthcare, education, or policing)? How does that affect us?
- How do power imbalances affect us in our relationships with other people?
- How can people work together to generate more positive uses of power?

Part 3: Sharing Power in

Decision-Making (40 minutes)

1. Divide the participants into two smaller groups: one with

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the Key Message : 'Power has many different faces and meanings. Power often  exists  in  relation  to  other  people.  We  are  constantly moving in and out of situations and relationships where we have more or less power. Sometimes, we use power in ways that are harmful to those around us, and sometimes, other people use their power in ways that are  harmful  to  us.  However,  each  of  us  has  the  ability to  use  power  in  positive  ways.  We  can  work  together to make positive changes that can help to develop our families and communities.'

## Part 3: Sharing Power in Decision-Making (40 minutes)

1. Divide the participants into two smaller groups: one with only men and one with only women. One facilitator should lead each group. Ask for a volunteer in each group who will present a summary of what their group discussed to the other participants.
2.  Once  the  groups  have  been  divided,  ask  the  following questions:

<!-- image -->

The  men's  group  facilitator  should say:

- Are there household decisions you would like to share more with your partner?
- What types of decisions?
- What are the barriers against sharing such power and decision-making?
- What would need to happen in your household to begin sharing decision-making power?
- What benefits would you and your family gain by sharing decision-making power?

<!-- image -->

## The women's group facilitator should say:

- Are there household decisions you would like to be more involved in?
- What types of decisions?
- What would need to happen in your household to begin sharing decision-making power (or making decisions together)?
3.  After  the  small  groups  have  finished  discussing,  ask  the participants to come back to the larger circle.
4. Ask a volunteer from the women's group to share a summary of what the women discussed. Next, ask a volunteer from the men's group to summarize the men's discussion.

<!-- image -->

## Ask the group if anyone would like to comment on what was shared. Then, ask some of the Group Discussion Questions:

-  What  are  some  of  the  negative  impacts  on  women when men are the main decision-makers in the family (for example, to their health or workload)?
- Are there any negative impacts on men when they are the main decision-makers in the family (for example, to their health or workload)?
- What are some of the negative impacts for children when  they  see  only  their  fathers  making  all  the  decisions?
- If only one person from the family makes all the major decisions, how does this negatively impact the family?
- Do you think it is realistic for men and women to share decision-making power within the family? Why or why not?
-  What  are  some  of  the  positive  impacts  for  families when  men  and  women  make  decisions  together?  For women? For men? For children?
- Are there any disadvantages to sharing decisions?
- How can men and women sharing both household decisions  (expenditure,  food  consumption,  maintenance, etc.) and family decision-making power (marriage, education, dress code, etc.) contribute to the economic development of the household?

Facilitator  Note:  Throughout  the  discussion,  encourage participants to think of the different benefits or advantages  of  men  and  women  sharing  decisions,  including how joint decision-making can benefit men, women, and children.

After  the  discussion  has  concluded,  end  the  activity  by thanking the participants for sharing their experience and ideas. Then, share the Key Messages:

- ·'Men are often  raised  to  be  the  head  of  the  household  and  to  have  the  final  say  in  household  decisions. As such, men often control access, use, and decisions around household finances, resources, marriage of children,  and  even  how  family  members  spend  their  time. This can have a negative impact on women, children, and men themselves.'

- 'However, there are many benefits that  come  when men and women participate equally in decisions that affect themselves and their families. It is often easier to make decisions when you can talk and advise each other. It also reduces the burden on one person to make decisions. Equitable decision-making requires sharing power between men and women, but it brings many positive benefits  for  men,  women,  children,  and  the  household in general.'
-  'Equitable  household  decision-making  means  men and women sharing power, discussing, and agreeing on decisions  together.  Not  all  decisions  need  to  be  made in this way: For example, there are important decisions that each person should be able to make for themselves, particularly regarding their own bodies and things such as whom and when to marry. However, when men and women make important decisions affecting the household together, it is easier to achieve the goals that they have for their families.'
- 'Finally, many of us want to share power but struggle to do so because we have not seen it done enough by others. But if we keep trying, we will not only get better but also be role models for others.'

## Part 4: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Drawing What You Feel. During this exercise, they'll try to channel their emotions into a short drawing activity.
2. Give each person a piece of paper and a pen/pencil.
3. Guide the participants through three rounds of deep breathing exercises, inviting them to close their eyes, focus on the feelings of their breath and exhalation (e.g., temperature of the air coming in through the nostrils, the way air goes in and through the nose and to the lungs), and concentrate on how they are feeling.
4. Have the participants take the next 3 or 4 minutes to draw something on their pieces of paper that reflects how they are feeling  at  the  moment.  This  doesn't  need  to  be  a  fancy  or well-drawn picture.

<!-- image -->

## Part 5: Weekly Commitment

(5 minutes)

Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'In the coming week, take some time to think of one or two aspects of family life where decisions affecting the family are traditionally made by men but that you will share or make together with your spouse, and others with your children. Talk about what kind of decision-making process you can implement that will help you come to the best decisions and what information you both need to make those decisions. In addition, try to identify a family decision that is usually made without the input of your children and think how you might be able to include them in that decision-making process and what the benefits could be to that.'

## Part 6: Closing and Check-Out

(5 minutes)

1.  Thank  all  participants  for  sharing  their  thoughts,  questions, concerns, and experiences today.

## Ask the group:

- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
2.  After  finishing  with  the  questions  and  other  comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
3. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
4.  Confirm  the  time,  date,  and  place  of  the  next  session  if there are any changes.

Write down the definitions of violence (written in the body of this activity) on the flipchart paper. Cover these definitions with another piece of  paper so the participants do not see them until you show them later.

- As noted in the 'Materials' section, it is important to have a list of existing referral services on hand to offer participants who may need additional counseling, mental health, legal, or psychosocial  support  services  for  individuals experiencing violence.

Facilitator Note: Should you feel that the participants do not wish to share personal details, do  not  force  them.  Instead,  ask  them  how another  person  would  feel  in  the  situation. Having experienced interpersonal violence is  strongly  associated  with  using  violence against partners or children later. Helping participants grasp the connection and think about the  pain  that  violence  has  caused  them,  as well as empathizing with people they care for in their lives and whom they may be hurting, is a potential way of interrupting the victim-aggressor cycle of violence.

Before this activity,  identify  what  (if  any)  the applicable laws are around violence, especially gender-based violence, in Jordan. Be prepared to share and discuss those with participants as well since questions may come up.

Session 7: Identifying Violence

## Session 7: Identifying Violence

<!-- image -->

## Preparation:

Literacy Note: This activity requires some literacy/writing ability, so be aware and mindful of participants' levels of literacy. If you feel one or more group members will struggle, explore alternative ways for them to complete the activity.

## Preparation for 'The Cycle of Violence':

Before the activity begins, set up five flipchart papers on the wall. On each paper, write one of the following phrases:

- o Violence used against me
- o Violence that I use
- o Violence that I have witnessed
- o How I feel when I use violence
- o How I feel when violence is used against me

In previous implementations of this session, it was much easier for men to talk about the violence they had suffered, particularly forms of violence that took place outside their homes. They felt a certain relief in being able to relay these  experiences  they  had  survived.  Commenting on or talking about violence committed  against  them  inside  their  homes  was  a more delicate matter. Some young men commented  on  domestic  violence;  however,  they did not want to go into details. It is important to  be  careful  not  to  insist.  For  men,  talking about violence they had committed was even more  difficult.  They  tended  to  justify  themselves, blaming the other person for being the aggressor.

<!-- image -->

It may be very difficult for women to discuss the violence they have experienced, out of shame or fear. It is important to create a safe space in the  women's group for women to share their experiences, but do not force anyone to share who does not want to. Women may also find it difficult to talk about the violence they have used (against children, for example).

## Part 1: Welcome and Check-In

(10 minutes)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.

2. Ask the group: 'Does anyone have a fun parenting story to share? Something successful you did, something funny your child  did  or  said,  or  something  they  did  that  you  are  proud of?'

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session? Did  you  talk  to  anyone  about  the  issues  discussed  in the group?

3.  Ask  participants  about  last  week's  commitment  to  pay attention to their emotions: 'Did anyone think of family decisions that you could make more equally or that you could make  with  greater  input  from  your  children?  If  so,  please share with the group, if you feel comfortable, how that discussion  went.  What  was  the  decision?  How  will  the  decision-making process be different in the future?'
4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## Part 2: What Is Violence?

(30 minutes)

1. Before anything else, explain: 'Today, we will be discussing  different  types  of  violence  that  exist  and  some  of  the ways we and others are affected by that violence. This topic is or can be uncomfortable or distressing for many of us. If at any time you need to take a moment to step outside and take a break from the discussion, for any reason, please go ahead without feeling the need to explain.'
2. Ask the group: 'What is violence?' Allow them to share their  opinions.  Write  down  the  responses  from  the  participants  on  a  flipchart  paper.  If  participants  identify  general types of violence, such as 'physical,' ask them for specific examples of this.

<!-- image -->

## Generations for Change - Parents Curriculum

3.  After  everyone  has  shared,  explain  to  the  group:  'At  its simplest level, violence is the way for one individual to have control or power over another. Violence is not a random act. It  happens in specific circumstances and settings. Violence happens more frequently in some settings than others, such as  during  periods  of  conflict,  but  it  is  also  very  present  in our homes and communities. Violence often occurs within the family and is often used by men against women and by parents against children, although these are not the only types of violence.'

Facilitator Note: It would be beneficial at this point to refer  to  any  Jordanian  laws  against  the  use  of  violence, particularly violence against women and violence against children.

4.  Tell  the  group  that  acts  of  violence  can  be  divided  into several  broad  categories.  Unveil  the  definitions  of  violence to the group:

- Physical violence: Using physical force, such as hitting, slapping, kicking, burning, or pushing.
- Emotional or psychological violence : Often the most difficult form of violence to identify. It may include humiliating,  threatening,  insulting,  pressuring,  and  expressing jealousy or possessiveness (such as controlling decisions and  activities).  It  can  also  include  restricting  someone's movements. This  form  of  violence  can  be  verbal  or  nonverbal.
- Sexual violence: Pressuring or forcing someone to perform sexual acts (from kissing to sex) against their will or making sexual comments that make someone feel humiliated or uncomfortable. It does not matter if the person has previously consented to sexual behavior - consent must be given at the time.
- Economic  violence: When  someone  else  exercises complete  control  over  a  person's  money  and  other  economic resources. This type of violence is a way of exerting power and can be used to control someone's movements: for example, keeping them from meeting friends.

Going  down  the  brainstormed  list,  ask  participants what kind of violence is listed until all kinds of  violence  have  been  categorized.  Then,  lead  a discussion  with  the  following  Group  Discussion Questions:

-  What  are  the  most  common  types  of  violence  that occur in your community? How about in romantic relationships?

Terre des hommes

Helping children worldwide.

Part 3: The Cycle of Violence

(45 minutes)

- Are there specific types of violence that happen more to women, men, boys, or girls?
- What kind of harm can violence cause? What are some of the consequences of violence? Is any kind of violence worse than another?
- In what ways is forcing a girl to get married before she is old enough a kind of violence?
- What is the relationship between power, violence, and restrictive ideas around gender? (Encourage the participants to think of the different types of power -economic, physical, etc. - that one person can have over another and link them to violence.)
- What can we do in our own households and communities to prevent violence from happening?

Facilitator Note: Probe for common types of violence committed against sons and daughters in schools, at home, and on the street. When talking about violence against children, it can become even more taboo because many parents do not recognize and may be resistant to labeling as violent 'small' or disciplinary kinds of violence, such as slapping on the wrist or spanking ('hitting that does not leave a mark'). Even small kinds of violence teach children  that  violence  is  an  acceptable  way  to  resolve conflict or disagreement. These difficult moments are often the best times to teach our children better ways and focus on our long-term goals for our children. This will be  discussed  in  more  detail  in  the  session  on  positive parenting, and you may want to look ahead to Session 10 to help you respond if it comes up in this activity.

Facilitator Note: It is important that participants understand that both men and women use violence; however, it is important that the conversation not be sidetracked by discussion of women's violence against men. As the facilitator, you can explain to the group that while there are  cases  of  women  using  violence  against  men,  the overwhelming majority of violence is perpetrated by men against women and children and that its drivers, magnitude, and consequences are significantly different. If the conversation becomes stuck on this issue, try and move the discussion along by asking another question.

<!-- image -->

## Share the Key Messages:

- ·'At its most basic level, violence is a way to control or have power over another person. People often only think about violence as physical aggression, but there are other  forms of violence as well. Most often, this violence is  targeted  toward  individuals  or  groups  that  are  more vulnerable or marginalized in our communities.'
-  'Violence  is  a  violation  of  a  person's  human  rights, whether it is enacted against women, men, or children.'
- ·'According to official data and statistics at the global, regional, and national levels, women are disproportionately  affected  by  intimate  partner  violence,  while  the perpetrators  of  this  type  of  violence  as  well  as  other types of crimes and violence (murders, sexual violence outside the home, etc.) are overwhelmingly men. Most men are not violent, but men in general often play a critical  role  in  sustaining  or  challenging  the  legitimacy  of using violence against women.'

## Part 3: The Cycle of Violence

(45 minutes)

Facilitator Note: Check the literacy level of your group. If there is low literacy, have participants draw examples of violence on their pieces of paper or sticky notes. Alternatively, you can pair participants up to discuss the topics and then ask for feedback in the larger group discussion. You can then write up the responses on the corresponding flipchart papers.

1. Explain to the participants that the purpose of this activity is to talk about the violence they experience in their lives and their communities, including the violence they have used and the violence used against them. Everything they say will be anonymous, and they are free to share as much or as little as they like, or not at all. The group will then discuss their feelings in relation to these types of violence. If necessary, review the flipchart paper from the previous activity that shows the different types of violence.

2. Give each participant five pieces of paper or sticky notes. Explain that there are five flipchart papers, and each has one of the following titles:

- Violence used against me
- Violence that I use
- Violence that I have witnessed
- How I feel when I use violence
- How I feel when violence is used against me

3.  Review  the  five  categories  and  ask  the  participants  to reflect  on  them  and  then  write  a  short  reply  for  each  on  a separate piece of paper. Each person should write at least one reply for each flipchart paper (or category). Allow about 10 minutes for this task. Explain that they should not write much, just a few words or a phrase. (They should not write their names.)

4. After 10 minutes, explain that they should put each phrase on the corresponding flipchart paper.

5.  Tell  participants  that  they  will  go  on  a  'gallery  walk'  to see what they and others have shared. However, stress that this is a SILENT activity, so there should be no discussion or laughter. Ask participants to go on a 'gallery walk' and read the responses.

Once everyone has finished their 'gallery walk,' ask them to return to their seats and lead a discussion  with  the  following  Group  Discussion  Questions:

- How did you feel as you read the responses on the flipchart papers? Which flipchart paper affected you most? Why?
- What was it like to think about the violence that you experienced?  What  was  it  like  to  think  about  the  violence that you used against other people?
- Is there any connection between the violence you use and the violence that is used against you?
- Some researchers say that violence is like a cycle: that is to say, someone who has experienced violence or who witnesses violence is more likely to commit acts of violence later on in life. If this is true, how can men interrupt this cycle of violence?
- What are the consequences for women who experience violence?
- What connections do you see between violence and gender? What role does the 'Man Box' play in men's use of violence against women?
- What role do men have in preventing violence against women?
- What role do men and women have in preventing violence against children?
- What are the common types of violence that young people  face,  inside  or  outside  the  home  (for  example, bullying)? How can we be supportive parents to our children when they experience violence?
- What have you learned in this activity to help overcome violence? Have you learned anything that can be applied in your own life and relationships?
- What role do society and the government have in preventing  violence  against  women  and  violence  against children?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Questions just for men:

- In general, when men are violent or when they suffer violence, do they talk about it? Do they report it? Do they talk about how they feel? If they do not, why not?
- What role can we play as men in preventing and responding to violence?

<!-- image -->

## Questions just for women:

- In general, when women suffer violence, do they talk about it? Whom, if anyone, might they talk about it with? Do they report it?
- What are society's expectations of what a woman is supposed to do if she suffers violence at the hands of her partner?

Close the discussion with the following Key Messages:

- 'Too many people have experienced or witnessed violence at some point in their lives, often at the hands of men. It is commonly assumed that violence is a 'natural' or 'normal' part of being a man. However, violence is a learned behavior - boys, girls, women, and men are often raised to think that violence is an acceptable means of maintaining control (particularly over women and children), resolving conflicts, or expressing anger.'

- 'Just as violence is learned, it can be unlearned. With this  in  mind,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  all  individuals, women and men, to strive to raise boys and men - as well as girls and women - to understand how violence prevents individuals from building positive and loving relationships.'
- 'Violence on an individual level is a behavior, which is learned and can be unlearned. It is the social responsibility of each individual to work on eliminating violence (at least those forms of violence that can be prevented by individuals) in the community, starting with oneself.'

## Part 4: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Affirmations. During this activity, you will have them close their eyes and think about what they are thankful for.
2. Have the participants close their eyes and ask: 'Think of one thing you are thankful for today. What makes you thankful for it? Whom do you have to be thankful to?' Give them 30 seconds to think.
3. Have them open their eyes and write what they are thankful for on a small piece of paper (or notecard) without their name.
4. Collect these papers in a hat or bucket and read them aloud to the group
5.  Thank the group for their vulnerability and sharing what they are thankful for.

## Part 5: Weekly Commitment

(5 minutes)

Facilitator Note: If you think this assignment would increase the risk of violence within the household, instead ask  the  participants  to  reflect  on  these  topics  on  their own.

Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'In the coming week, consider  having  a  conversation  with  your  partner  and/or  with your sons or daughters, if you are comfortable. During this conversation, you could share how you felt while remembering an act of verbal, psychological, or physical violence

that was done against you. This would be an excellent opportunity to make a promise within the family that disagreements  will  always  be  resolved  without  using  violence  and with respect for the other person's right to disagree.'

2. Ask the group: 'Does anyone have a fun parenting story to share? Something successful you did, something funny your child  did  or  said,  or  something  they  did  that  you  are  proud of?'

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session? Did  you  talk  to  anyone  about  the  issues  discussed  in the group?

3.  Ask  about  last  week's  commitment:  'Did  anyone  have  a discussion with their partner or anyone else about violence? Did you talk about how to effectively break the cycle of violence in families and communities?'

4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

1. Have the participants get into their couple pairs and face each other.

2. Pass out copies of Resource Page 8.1. Be sure to pass them out in the middle of the pair so one person is seeing the princess and the other person is seeing the old woman.

3. Ask one person to tell the other what they see in the photo. Ask the other person to tell the first person what they see in the photo. Make them try to convince the other person that they are right and the other person is wrong.

4. Say that you have passed out the same picture to everyone - how can there be different views on this? Who is right?

<!-- image -->

5.  At  this  point,  hopefully,  someone  will  point  out  that  the picture is different depending on how you are holding it. If they do not, ask everyone to turn their picture so they can see what the others are seeing.

6.  Explain:  'Even  though  we  were  all  looking  at  the  same thing, since we saw it from different perspectives, we had different  opinions  about  what  it  was.  No  one  was  right  or wrong; we were all just operating with different information and seeing things as they were presented to us. Keep that in mind, and we'll return to it as we continue our discussion.'

## Part 3: Sources of and Ways to Resolve Family Conflict

(65 minutes)

1. Tell the group: 'Before we start this next activity, I would like to know: What do you feel are the main topics or sources of conflict between spouses in this community?' Write down participants'  answers  on  a  flipchart  paper  and  have  them identify the four most common sources of conflict. You can ask follow-up questions to probe for details, such as, 'What are  the  causes  of  these  conflicts?'  (For  example:  Poverty, displacement,  stress,  economic  constraints)  and  'When  do conflicts often occur?' (For example: At night, in the morning trying to get ready for work and school, around holidays)

2.  Now,  tell  the  group:  'Breaking  the  cycle  of  violence  requires  finding  new  ways  of  resolving  conflict  that  do  not involve  violence  or  aggression.  Conflict  is  a  normal  part  of life and is not inherently bad unless it is dealt with poorly or leads to other problems. Communicating our feelings is a very important way of resolving conflict and can even help us to avoid conflict in the first place. And often, that conflict may not  even  stem  from  a  disagreement  but  is  simply  because partners have different or incomplete information, have different perspectives on an issue, or have not communicated about an issue effectively.'

3. Continue by saying: 'A few sessions ago, we did an activity that helped us think of positive ways to express our anger to avoid harming others we care about. We will now discuss and rehearse the next step after we have identified and managed our anger - positive ways of communicating to resolve conflict, ways that can be used in our relationships with our spouses or partners but also with friends, family members, and others.'

## Ask the group the following questions:

-  What  words  do  you  use  to  communicate  with  each other? How do you normally communicate with the other person?
- Why is communication in a relationship important?
- What happens when we are able to communicate directly with our partner?
- How might our partner feel if we do not communicate that we are upset?
- How might we feel or what might happen if we do not communicate that we are upset?
- Do problems disappear if we don't talk about them?

4.  After  the  group has finished discussing, present to them the  following  three  types  of  communication  responses  to conflict:

- Avoidance: Avoiding the topic that has made us upset; pushing our feelings inside ourselves because we do not want to talk about it
- Escalation: Arguing,  raising  your  voice,  or  even  becoming violent
- Empathy: Understanding  a  situation  from  the  other person's perspective; seeing through someone else's eyes

5. Explain that we want to strive for empathy in our responses  to  conflict.  Empathy  can  help  us  communicate  with  our partners when we are angry or we have a conflict. Empathy means understanding a situation from another person's point of view. To do that, it is helpful to express our own feelings in a calm way, such as, 'I can see that you are very busy…' or 'I feel frustrated about what happened…' or 'I want to understand what is bothering you.' Communicating our feelings in a constructive way allows the other person to see the situation from our eyes.

6. Ask the group: 'Do you think these phrases could be useful for you to communicate when you have conflicts in your relationship? Why or why not?'

7. Based on the sources of conflict listed at the beginning of the activity or other examples that have come up, prepare six to eight very short scenarios that could lead to conflict. Write them on pieces of paper, and put them up around the room. Examples could include:

<!-- image -->

- It is the end of the month and money is a little short to pay all the bills.
- Both of you have come home late from work and there is no dinner ready.
- Your child got into trouble at school, and only one of you knew about it.
- One parent wants their daughter to get married at age 13, but the other wants her to finish school and wait until she is at least 18.
- One of you wants to have another child, and the other does not.
- Two sets of relatives want to visit for Eid, but there is only enough room and food for one set.

8. Ask each couple to go around the room, read the different scenarios, and choose one to act out. Explain that each couple will have 2 or 3 minutes to role-play a healthy relationship, using communication - rather than violence or aggression to resolve a conflict. Explain that each group will be asked to create a scene where a husband and wife are quarreling about a topic and both partners are becoming angry. The roleplay should show the couple communicating to resolve the conflict without resorting to violence. The participants should think about how the couple would act: What would they say? What phrases would they use? Encourage the participants to also include some of the strategies for managing anger that they discussed a few sessions ago.

9. Give the groups 10 minutes to develop their role-play resolving the conflict through discussion and communication.

10. After 10 minutes, ask everyone to come back to the circle and have each group present their role-play in turn.

## After  all  the  groups  have  presented,  open  up  the discussion  using  these  Group  Discussion  Questions:

- What were some of the ways that the couples communicated their feelings during the role-plays?
- Do we always know why our partner is upset? Does our partner know why we are upset? What are the benefits of communicating your feelings during a conflict?
- How could this conflict have been prevented in the first place?
- Do you think it would be easy for a woman to express her feelings during an argument? Why or why not?
- Do you think it would be easy for a man to express his feelings (other than anger) during an argument? Why or why not?

Part 4: Interviewing My Spouse or Partner (30 minutes)

Facilitator Note: This exercise should be done in an open

Facilitator Note: Refer back to the sessions on power and norms around what it means to be a man if the participants  don't  include  these  topics  themselves.  You  may also note that men are often raised not to discuss their feelings and with the idea that they should be the primary decision-makers in the family. This can contribute to a lack of communication between partners, which can lead both partners to have unclear expectations of each other and thus can contribute to conflict.

- How can we remember to 'see through someone else's eyes' when we are angry with our partners and our children?
- Do you think you could use these skills for communicating in real life? Why or why not?
- How can these communication methods lead to concrete problem-solving in couple relationships? How can they help us in disagreements with our children?
- What else can be done to address the common causes of disagreement between partners and between parents and children?

Close the activity with the following Key Messages :

-  'Conflict  always  exists,  but  it  does  not  need  to  be violent  or  angry.  It  can  be  an  opportunity  for  personal growth and development, and it can also deepen our understanding of our partner and strengthen our relationship  rather  than  be  an  opportunity  for  violence.  When we communicate with each other, we can resolve conflict peacefully and avoid future conflict.'
- 'Sometimes when we are sad or frustrated, we don't talk  about  it.  Very  often,  by  not  talking,  the  frustration or anger builds up until it is expressed through physical aggression or shouting.'
- 'Communication is a key part of healthy relationships. Communicating  our  feelings  to  the  other  person  is  an important part of resolving conflict and is much more effective than violence. Take the time to talk to your partner and to listen to him or her. When we communicate, we can often stop a conflict before it starts or resolve it without resorting to violence.'

<!-- image -->

## Part 4: Interviewing My Spouse or Partner (30 minutes)

Facilitator Note: This exercise should be done in an open area so that couples have enough space to chat privately.

1. Say: 'We are now going to build on our discussion of conflict by developing our communication skills. In most cases, open-ended  questions  are  best  to  obtain  information  and achieve good communication. This is because…'

- 'They give you more information.'
- 'Through their answers, people can relay information, feelings, attitudes, and their understanding of the topic.'
- 'Closed questions that require a yes-or-no answer tend to end the conversation or be met with answers that provide  little  information  and  don't  allow  the  respondent's ideas, opinions, and emotions to be known.'
2. Mention that open-ended questions usually begin with:
- Why
- What
- How

3. Ask the group to give examples of open-ended questions. As needed, share other examples of open-ended questions, such as:

- What do you think about that?
- Why did you do that?
- How do you plan to achieve that?
- What do you think will happen now?
- How would you change things?
- What do you want to happen?
- What's causing the problem?
- Can you tell me more?

4. Explain that close-ended questions only require a 'yes' or 'no' answer and do not give you much information. Ask how you can change these close-ended questions into open-ended ones:

- Did you enjoy the session today?
- Did you cook lunch?
- Are you upset with me?

5. As the facilitator, think of something that made you very happy recently.

6. Say: 'I am thinking of something that made me very happy. Take turns asking me open-ended questions about what made me happy.' (Examples: 'Why are you very happy?' 'How did this  happen?'  'Why  does  this  make  you  very  happy?')  Encourage participants to keep asking open-ended questions.

(5 minutes)

1 Tell the narticinants that vou will he leadina them throuch

7. Ask: 'How difficult was it to find out what made me happy?'
8. Ask the group why we are talking about different kinds of questions. Point out that asking questions can be an opportunity to build and deepen relationships. This will form a solid foundation for times when you disagree.
9. Ask participants to pair up with their partner/spouse. Have them find a place in the room where they can talk and no one will hear them. If they would like to go outside, explain the exercise first and then let them go.
10. Explain that in this exercise, all they need to do is ask open-ended questions and answer honestly. They will take turns  asking  these  open-ended  questions,  with  one  person being the listener and the other being the asker until they are told to switch roles:
- What is a childhood memory you have that has left a mark on your life?
- Who is someone who inspires you? Why do they inspire you?
- If  you  could  be  anywhere in the world, where would you be and why?
11. The person who is asking the questions should listen and not interrupt. However, they can ask follow-up, open-ended questions to find out more about their partner's answer.
12. Give them 15 to 20 minutes for this exercise, and then have them come back to the circle. VERY IMPORTANT: At the halfway mark of the time allotted, have the participants switch. This is to avoid one participant taking up the majority of the time and to share evenly.

## Ask for a couple of volunteers to share their reflections from doing this exercise. Ask the following Group Discussion Questions:

- How did it feel when you were listened to?
- How did you feel when you were listening closely to your partner and showing interest?
- What new things did you learn about your partner?
- How can you use these skills of active listening and asking open-ended questions in your lives? How can this help you prevent conflicts before they happen?

<!-- image -->

## Share the Key Messages:

- 'This activity demonstrates the importance of a couple creating space to mutually listen with true curiosity and interest in the other person. In our busy day-to-day lives with many obligations and worries, it is sometimes difficult to set aside time to connect with our partner and pay attention to what they are really saying.'
- 'Dedicating the time and attention to respond to the needs of our partner and to listen carefully to their needs, without judgment, helps strengthen the relationship and make both partners feel appreciated and valued and also know themselves and their partner more.'

## Part 5: Mindfulness Activity

## (5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Self-Massage.
2. Ask the participants to bring their hands together and use one thumb to rub the other hand. Continue this for 30 seconds and then have them switch hands.
3. Then, have them bring their hands to the shoulders and rub their shoulders to relieve some of the tension. Continue this for 30 seconds.
4. Bring their attention to their necks. Have them bring their hands to the back of their necks and rub in a circular motion for 30 seconds.
5. Have them bring their hands to the sides of their heads by their foreheads (temples). Have them gently rub in a circular motion for 30 seconds.
6. Lastly, have them take three long, deep breaths.

## Part 1: Welcome and Check-In (10 minutes)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.

2. Ask the group: 'Does anyone have a fun parenting story to share? Something successful you did, something funny your child  did  or  said,  or  something  they  did  that  you  are  proud of?'

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session? Did  you  talk  to  anyone  about  the  issues  discussed  in the group?

3. Ask about last week's commitment. 'Was anyone able to try some of the positive communication and nonviolent conflict resolution skills in their family? Was anyone able to prevent or resolve conflict more effectively?'

4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## Part 2: Transition to Adulthood Fishbowl (60 minutes)

1. Begin this activity by explaining: 'Puberty is a time when the bodies of boys and girls change. Puberty happens because new chemicals called hormones are developing in the body, turning young people into adults. Usually, puberty starts between ages 8 and 13 in girls and between ages 10 and 15 in boys, although some young people start puberty earlier or later. Typically, but not always, girls begin puberty about two years before boys. During puberty, when a girl starts having her period, she becomes physically able to become pregnant. During  puberty,  a  boy  becomes  physically  able  to  father  a child. Although the physical ability to have a baby is there, it  does not mean she is ready to have a baby or that he is ready to be a father, only that they are physically capable of creating and having a baby. It is not healthy for young girls to have babies because their bodies have not finished growing. There is a page in your journals that talks about these physical changes in more detail.'

<!-- image -->

2. Continue by saying: 'For this activity, however, we are going to focus not on young people's physical changes but rather on the changes in their minds, emotions, and behaviors. Parents often feel frustrated when their children begin to grow up into young adults, usually starting around 10 to 12 years old.  The  relationship  between  a  parent  and  child  begins  to change because the child wants more independence and is figuring out their own identity. What are some of the emotional,  behavioral,  and  personality  changes  we  see  with  young men and women around this age, 10 to 14?' Write down the answers  on  a  flipchart  paper.  People  may  suggest  physical changes but help them focus on the changes that they cannot see.

3. Ask participants to turn to Journal Resource Page 9.1 ('Information About Young Teens'). Read this page out loud to the  participants.  Mention  that  Journal  Resource  Page  9.3 ('Changes to My Body') goes over the physical changes adolescents  go  through.  Although  you  won't  be  concentrating on these today, encourage the participants to review the resource page on their own time.

4. Explain to the group they will do an activity called the Fishbowl. The purpose of this activity is for men and women to learn about the others' experiences of what it was like in this 'middle' transition from childhood to adulthood and how they were supported by their parents.

5. Divide the men and women into separate groups. First, ask the women to sit in a circle in the middle of the room. Then, ask the men to form an outer circle around the women and sit facing in.

6. Explain to the group the women are now the 'fish,' and the men are the 'bowl.' Say that those in the 'bowl' (men) must stay silent and listen to the women's answers to the following questions. The women should be talking to other women in the inner circle while the men are listening on the outside.

Terre des hommes

Helping children worldwide.

Part 3: Showing Affection for

My Child (30 minutes)

One at  a  time,  ask  the  following  questions.  Give participants plenty of time to answer. (You will ask both the men and women the same questions.)

- What did you enjoy about that time in your life, the transition from childhood to adulthood?
- What about that time in your life did you not like or find challenging?
- What things did your parents do to support you at that time in your life, either intentionally or unintentionally, that you found particularly helpful?
- What things, if any, did they do that were not helpful or you would not like to repeat with your children?
- How have you so far, or how do you plan in the future, to support your children through that time in their lives? Are  there  any  ways  you  might  support  your  sons  and daughters differently to effectively meet their needs?

Facilitator  Note:  Do  not  be  afraid  to  bring  in  your  own personal experiences of going through that time in your life. What did you dislike about that time and your changes? What did you enjoy? Emphasize that these changes are a normal part of growing up.

7. Once the women finish discussing the questions for about 15 to 20 minutes, or a bit more if needed, close the discussion. Then, have the men and women switch places.

8. Say that the men are now the 'fish' and the women are the 'bowl.' Facilitate a discussion with the men using the same questions from Step 7.

9. Thank everyone for sharing their experiences. Ask for one or two volunteers to share how the activity was for them.

Alternative Version: If  you  feel  strongly  that  participants will not be comfortable discussing this time in their lives in front  of  each  other,  you  can  do  this  activity  slightly  differently.  Have  two  separate  groups,  one  for  men  and  one  for women. Ask them the same questions and have them discuss in their groups and write down the answers on flipchart papers. Then, have one or two people from each group report back the entire group's answers without attributing answers to specific people.

<!-- image -->

## Part 3: Showing Affection for My Child (30 minutes)

1. When participants are back in one larger circle, ask: 'What are some of the ways you show love and affection for your children?' Write down their answers.

Facilitator Note: It is possible that some parents might say they show love and affection in ways that are harmful to children. Be sure to hold participants accountable for the types of 'power over' they might be exerting to show their love and affection. For example, love and affection are generally the justification for early and forced marriage of daughters or for the violent punishment of women or children for what is considered misbehavior or for having stepped outside of what is expected of their gender.  Be  sure  to  challenge  unequal  power  dynamics and praise examples of love and affection that encourage the autonomy and safety of their children.

2. Have participants turn to Journal Resource Page 9.2 ('Supporting and Showing Affection') for the participants and review together as a group.

## Ask some of the following Group Discussion Questions:

-  How  have  the  ways  you  express  love  and  affection changed over time? Have they changed as your children have gotten older?
- Is the way women express affection for their children different  than  the  way  men  express  affection  for  their children? Is it different depending on whether it's a girl or a boy?
-  If  you  have  more  than  one  child,  did  your  approach change with your second or third?
- Have you ever struggled with showing love and affection for your children? How so? How did you overcome those struggles?
- How do the ways you show love and affection affect your  parenting  style  and  how  you  discipline  your  children?

## Close with the following Key Messages:

- 'For young people, puberty can be an exciting time, but also a confusing one when they are discovering who they are and need to feel they are valued and accepted.'
- 'Parents play a very important role in educating their children about the normal physical and emotional changes that occur during puberty, as well as understanding that  often  they  have  difficult  emotions  as  they  experience these changes.'
- 'Parents do not have to be the experts. The most important  thing  you  can  provide  to  your  children  is  love, acceptance, and support.'

## Part 4: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Shake It Out. This is a good exercise  to  do  when  you're  feeling  stressed  and  helps  to  release built-up emotions.
2. Ask everyone to stand (if they can; otherwise, it is okay to do this exercise in a chair or seated position, too!). Explain that you will be calling out a body part that the group will need to shake out however they want to. Each body part is going to get 10 seconds of shaking, and then you'll move on to the next one.

## 3. Read the script:

- 'Start with your feet. Shake your left foot! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'

'Next, your right foot! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'

'Now, move that shake up the whole of your left leg. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'

'Next, your right leg. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'

'Now, shake out your right arm. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'

'Then, your left arm 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'

'Now, move that shaking feeling up and down the whole of your body! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.'

4.  After  a  minute  is  up,  get  everyone  to  stop,  take  a  deep breath, and let their breathing return to normal.
5. Thank the participants for their participation. Remind them that they can do this at home at any point there are feelings that they want to get out of their system.

Section 1: Introduction

## Facilitator Note:

This topic often elicits very strong reactions. Remember in your facilitation that we are not trying to shame people for what they did in the past, but to help them learn to do better in the future. Focus on how positive parenting is better for children emotionally and developmentally and is more effective at achieving the goals parents have for their children.

Another  thing  that  parents  often  bring  up  is,  'I  was spanked/slapped/whipped  as  a  child,  and  I  turned  out fine.  I'm  doing  great!'  The  psychologist  interviewed  in this article (https://www.vox.com/2016/4/27/11510118/ spanking-children) gives an excellent response to that:

Let's be realistic, most people who were spanked were spanked as children. And as everyone likes to tell me, they turned out okay. And me included. I think I turned out okay despite being spanked.

The  question  is:  Did  other  things  counterbalance  the spanking?

I don't think we learn to be good people who care about others by being hit. … [We learn from our parents,] who talk  to  us  about  the  value  and  the  morality  of  sharing with  other  people  and  taking  turns  and  thinking  about others' feelings.

We know now that children need to be in car seats and seat  belts.  But  those  of  us  who  grew  up  in  the  1970s were in cars that didn't even have seat belts. Do I think my parents were bad parents for not putting me in a seat belt? No, because no one understood how important seat belts were to protecting children. Do I think I 'turned out okay' because I wasn't in a seat belt? No - I think I was lucky. It's the same with spanking.

We turned out okay in spite of being spanked, not because of it.

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

How are you? Has anything new happened since the last session? Did  you  talk  to  anyone  about  the  issues  discussed  in the group?

3. Also ask participants: Was anyone able to show their children love and affection during the last week? What did you do or tell them to show them? How did that make them feel?

4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

<!-- image -->

## Section 1: Introduction

1. Explain to participants: 'For the past few weeks, we have improved our understanding of how to communicate effectively with our partners and our families. We have also talked about how a father is more than just a provider - men are parents who are equally capable of providing an emotionally and  developmentally  safe  environment  in  which  their  children can thrive and grow. We talked a lot last week about how to provide a loving, nurturing environment when young people are going through the life changes of puberty and how we can support them.'

2. Explain: 'However, challenges are inevitable. Parents will experience,  and  probably  already  have  experienced,  challenges because children do not always do what parents ask, even when they give those children praise.'

3. Ask participants to share some of the biggest challenges they have had getting their adolescents to behave in acceptable  ways.  For  example,  'My  kids  never  seem  to  listen  to what I say' or 'Adolescents can be very demanding - they want everything' or 'Young people always seem distracted by technology!'

4. Emphasize: 'There are no bad children, only difficult behaviors. Children are not inherently bad; they are just behaving in inappropriate or difficult ways, in many instances because they are struggling to communicate in more effective ways -  just  as  we  have  been  speaking  about  how  we  as  adults can  struggle  to  communicate  in  the  best  or  most  effective ways. And when we speak about discipline for children, it is important to remember that a specific moment of a young person doing something wrong, and a parent responding, is only one percent of what we think of as discipline. Effective discipline is about the environment we create, incentives and disincentives, opportunities, teaching lessons, and of course, love and affection. If we only focus on the moment a young person is disobedient, then we will inevitably fail.'

5.  Also  discuss  how  a  role  that  often  falls  to  the  father  is being the disciplinarian in the family. Ask: 'What does being a disciplinarian have to do with society's expectations about being a man?' For example, traditionally (though not for all families), fathers are seen as the ones who enforce the rules and create a sense of order and respect in the family.

6. Ask participants: 'What are the common ways men discipline  their  children,  especially  when  they  become  angry  or frustrated?  What about women? Does this ever depend on whether it is a girl or a boy?'

7.  State  that  when  children  misbehave,  parents  commonly yell, threaten, or even hit children and young people. This can interfere with parents' long-term goals.

8. Ask: 'What are some negative effects of violence on children?  How  would  this  affect  their  ability  to  achieve  their long-term goals?'

<!-- image -->

Explain:  'There  are  better  and  more  effective  ways  to  discipline  children  than  hitting,  slapping,  or  shouting  at  them. Those methods are not just wrong but also counterproductive. Striking a child does not teach them to behave, it teaches them that…'

- 'We communicate important things by hitting.'
- •'Hitting is an acceptable response to anger.'
- 'The people they depend on to protect them will sometimes hurt them.'
- 'They should fear their parents rather than trusting them to help and teach.'
- 'Their home is an unsafe place for learning and exploration.'

9. Explain: 'Even if children comply, they are doing so out of fear, not out of respect, love, or understanding. Think about how it feels to be hit as an adult. We feel humiliated. We don't feel motivated to please and learn from the person who hit  us;  we  feel  resentment and fear. So today, we will talk about 'positive parenting,' specifically for young people aged about 10 to 14.'

10.  Before  discussing  the  techniques,  open  the  flipchart  to the Positive Parenting Diagram for participants to read and tell them it is also Journal Resource Page 10.1. Read it out loud and walk through the steps with the group.

11. Now refer to Journal Resource Page 10.2. ('Positive Parenting Techniques'). Read them aloud as the participants follow along in their journals.

## Ask if there are any questions. Then, ask participants the following questions:

- What do you notice about the  parenting  techniques recommended?
- Have you seen or tried such techniques before?
- How does this framework relate to our discussion last week about how we provide love, affection, and support for our young people?

## Section 2: Role-Plays

1.  Now divide the participants into four  groups  and  assign them a scenario from the following table. Tell them they will prepare a realistic role-play scene between a young person aged 10 to 14 and a parent. The young person is misbehaving, and the parent must use positive discipline techniques to address the unwanted behavior. Tell the participants that to develop their role-play, after they read the scenario, they should think about the following:

- What are some other possible reasons (based on age, development, etc.) he or she might be acting this way? Just  as  we  discussed  earlier  in  our  group,  sometimes we express a behavior or emotion (such as anger) even though what we are feeling is another one (such as sadness or frustration).
- Is my goal here to punish my child or to educate them so they will behave better in the future? What positive behavior would I like to see instead of this negative behavior?
- What actions, both now and in the future, should I take if I want to see more of the positive behavior and less of the negative one?
- What action can I take that is consistent with showing love and affection for my child?
- Is there any strategy on Journal Resource Page 10.2 that might be helpful in this situation?

2.  Give  the  participants  10  minutes  to  plan  their  role-play. After 10 minutes, ask the groups to present their role-plays.

## Scenario #1

Your  adolescent  son  is  spending  a  lot  of  time  playing video  games.  Every  day,  you  have  to  fight  with  him  to get him to turn the games off and do his homework. You worry that he is getting hooked on video games and will lose interest in everything else.

## Scenario #2

You  have  a  rule  that  your  adolescent  is  to  come  right home  every  day  after  school.  Even  though  you're  not home at that time, they have always followed this rule. But one day, they are invited to a friend's house and accept. You just happen to come home early that day and discover that they aren't there. You are frantic with worry. They come home soon after.

<!-- image -->

## Scenario #3

Your adolescent comes home from school in a very bad mood. She doesn't want to talk to you and has an angry tone in her voice.

## Scenario #4

You find a love letter on your adolescent girl's bed from a male student at school.

## After the role-plays, open the discussion using the Group Discussion Questions:

- What do you think using violent discipline tells a young person about him- or herself? How does it make him or her feel?
- We know that sometimes our expectations and discipline  of  our  sons  and  daughters  are  different.  Why  do these differences exist? Are there any negative impacts of treating them differently?
-  For  any  of  the  role-plays,  what  other  or  additional forms of positive discipline could have been used?
- Is there any connection between the way parents were raised and the ways they raise and discipline or punish their children?
- Which technique would be the easiest to use with your children? Why?
- Which technique would be the most difficult to use? Why? What could you do to make it easier to use?
- What obstacles might you face in using these positive parenting techniques?
- What are other ways to discipline children that do not involve hitting, slapping, or yelling and help you achieve your long-term goals for your child?
- What are ways in which we can recognize children for positive behavior?
- How does 'warmth,' such as showing physical affection like hugging or saying, 'I love you' to your child, help to reinforce good behavior?
- Do you think you will use any of these techniques in your own family?
- How could you encourage others to use positive discipline techniques?
- Who else in your home needs to be engaged in using positive parenting techniques?

-  'However,  these  aggressive  techniques  create  fear and harm a child's development. They interfere with our long-term goals for our children. Positive parenting is not about  being  soft  on  children  or  letting  them  get  away with naughty behavior. It is about using techniques that are both healthier for children and more effective in the long term.'
- 'Positive parenting means that we will be teaching the values we want a child to learn.'
- 'Parents must be patient, as the rewards of positive parenting can take time. Keep in mind that you are playing  the  long  game;  having  a  child  that  behaves  today is  nice, but even more important is having a child who grows up to be a healthy, intelligent, mature, and secure adult.  You  are  raising  your  children  for  what  they  will become, so try to maintain the long-term perspective.'

## Part 3: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Checking In.
2. Ask the participants to close their eyes if they are comfortable and take three deep, long breaths.

## 3. Ask them to think about the following questions.

Pause for 20 seconds between each of the questions:

- How is my body feeling?
- Is there anything bothering or upsetting me?
- Where do I feel the tension or discomfort in my body?

Is it the throat, chest, shoulders, or somewhere else?

- Can I soften that part of the body and imagine how it feels under a warm, yellow light?
- What do I need right now?
- What things I am thankful for and why?
4.  Ask  them  to  take  another  three  deep,  long  breaths  and open their eyes.

## Part 4: Weekly Commitment

(5 minutes)

Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'Please read through this week's  journal  resource  pages  again.  Discuss  with  your spouse at home some ways you can introduce more positive parenting techniques into your relationship with your adolescents. Come up with specific, practical things you both can do. After you have decided, talk about how you can handle one area of common misunderstandings or conflicts - for example, setting expectations and agreeing on consequences with your adolescent.'

## Part 5: Closing and Check-Out

(5 minutes)

1.  Thank  all  participants  for  sharing  their  thoughts,  questions, concerns, and experiences today.

## Ask the group:

- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
2.  After  finishing  with  the  questions  and  other  comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
3. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
4.  Confirm  the  time,  date,  and  place  of  the  next  session  if there are any changes.

Session 11: Communicating as a Family

## Session 11: Communicating as a Family

Objectives:

## Objectives:

- To reflect on the importance of communication, interaction, and affection between parents and their sons and daughters
- To develop skills for more effective communication between parents and young people

## Participants:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Men and women together; together with boys and girls

## Preparation:

Since  this  will  be  the  first  session  with  both parents and boys and girls, make sure to meet with  the  facilitators  of  the  groups  for  young people beforehand to discuss how your groups have gone so far and to prepare to facilitate together.

Think  about  your  own  experiences  communicating with your parents and other adults when you were younger and, if you are a parent, how you and your children communicate with each other. Make a few notes about what works and doesn't  work  for  you  so  you  can  share  them with participants.

- Print  copies  of  Journal  Resource  Page  11.1 ('Communicating as a Family') for youth and adults.

Literacy Note: This activity requires some literacy/writing ability, so be aware and mindful of participants' levels of literacy. If you feel one or more group members will struggle, explore alternative ways for them to complete the activity.

## Materials:

- Markers
- Flipchart paper and easel (or tape for walls)
-  Participant  Journals  (session  uses  Journal Resource  Page  11.1,  'Communicating  as  a Family')
-  Non-standard  food-related materials for building  small  towers.  You  need  two  sets  of things: one is 'connectors' (such as toothpicks, drinking straws, noodles, or pipe cleaners) and the other is 'blocks' (such as marshmallows, Turkish delight/rahat al-hulqum, halva, or even dates). Make sure you have a lot of each, as each family will need some and there will be two rounds of using them. Get some napkins or paper towels, too.
- Measuring tape or stick
- Song and phone/speakers

## Part 1: Welcome and Check-In (10 minutes)

1. Thank all the participants for coming.

2. This is the first session that the young men and women will be in, so go around and have all participants introduce themselves  and  who  their  parents/children  are.  Some  men  may want to introduce their partners, or parents to introduce their children, but make sure that each person introduces him- or herself.

3. For the parents, ask them to:

Say their name

Point out their spouse and children

- Say one thing about each of their children present that they are very proud of
4. For the young men and women, ask them to:
- Say their name

Point out who their parents and siblings (if present) are

Say one fun or silly thing that their parents always do that they like or that embarrasses them

5. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## Part 2: Construction Project (20 minutes)

1.  Divide  the  group  into  families  and  give  each  family  as many 'connectors' as they want and 20 'blocks.' Tell them they can have more 'connectors' if they need them.

2. Tell participants 'As a family, you have 10 minutes to build the tallest tower you can using the materials you have and nothing else. Whichever family builds the tallest tower wins, but it must be stable enough to stand up by itself and stay standing.'

<!-- image -->

3. As participants work, facilitators should go around observing dynamics in the families. Who is directing the activity? Who  is  doing  the  work?  Are  the  parents  leading  and  the children following, maybe not even staying engaged, or are they collaborating together to build the tower? Is one family member, such as the father, dominating the process? How are they communicating with each other? Are there conflicts? Is anyone getting angry?

4. After 10 minutes, ask everyone to stop. Ask each group to present their tower and have it measured by the facilitators.

## Ask each group:

- How did the building project go?
- What was successful and what was challenging about this for your family?
- How did you work together as a team?
-  Who  was  making  decisions  about  the  construction? Why do you think this is?
- How do you think this relates to decisions we make in the family? Is there a way that we can consider everyone's ideas in a more balanced way and collaborate better?'

Facilitator Note: In the challenges section, try not to concentrate on the quality of the material and shift the conversation to what was challenging about communicating or working together.

5. At the end, thank participants, ask them to dismantle and eat their towers (if they want), and say that we will discuss more later.

## Part 3: Communicating as a Family (60 minutes)

1. Continue the session by saying: 'Communication between parents  and  their  children  is  often  challenging  for  both groups. Children want to assert their independence, try new things, be curious and explore, and do things they enjoy. All of that is perfectly normal developmentally. Parents, on the other hand, worry that children will get hurt or end up in a dangerous situation, will accidentally hurt someone else, or will end up with problems at school or in the community. They are doing what they feel is best, but their children often see it as unfair, overly restrictive, or simply not making any sense.'

## Ask the following questions:

- In the tower building activity, how did you communicate your ideas? How did you listen to the others?
- Thinking back to the other sessions, did you feel comfortable  using  'I'  statements  and  the  active  listening skills you've practiced in the past? Why or why not?
- What are some tips that youth could use with their parents  to  communicate  effectively?  (Use  Journal  Resource Page 11.1 as a guide for the answers.)
- What are some tips that parents could use with their children  to  communicate  effectively?  (Use  Journal  Resource Page 11.1 as a guide for the answers.)

2. Tell the group: 'Before we start the next activity, I would like to know: What do you feel are the main topics or sources of conflict between parents and their children?' Write down participants'  answers  on  a  flipchart  paper  and  have  them identify the six most common sources of conflict.

3.  Now, say: 'In a moment, we are going to do some roleplays, but first, let's devise six story scenarios based on the sources of conflict we just listed.'

4. Write down the six scenarios (possible examples are given in the following Facilitator Note) and assign them to six of the families present.

Facilitator Note: If you and the participants need some inspiration for role-plays, here are three scenarios that were written for the youth curriculum:

- You are supposed to come straight home after school, but one day, you take longer than usual talking with your friends  and  getting  a  snack,  and  then  you  are  delayed because a bridge  is  closed.  When  you  get  home,  your parents are both worried and angry.
- You have missed a couple of assignments in school, and  your  teacher  sends  home  a  note  for  your  parents about it. You didn't mean to miss the assignments, but you forgot about one and lost the other. You don't want to give your parents the note because of how you think they will react.
- You have been spending a little bit of time after school with someone of the opposite sex you like. One day, your younger sibling accidentally tells your parents about it, and they want you to stop.

<!-- image -->

5.  Give  these  further  directions  to  the  families  who  will  be doing the role-plays: 'You should create two role-plays of the same scenario…'

- 'In  the  first  role-play,  show  the  conflict  the  way  it  often happens, with parents and children not understanding each other, getting frustrated, and perhaps even shouting.'
-  'In  the  second  version,  show  the  conflict  but  with  both parties  seeing  it  from  the  other's  perspective,  not  getting frustrated, and trying to reach a solution that makes both parties happy. Demonstrate at least one, or even more, ways to constructively reach a solution. I want everyone to try using empathy, which is understanding a situation from the other person's perspective. And above all, be realistic. Don't make up a scenario that you don't believe would work in real life.'

6. Continue the directions, saying: 'There is just one condition: In your role-plays, the young people have to play the role of parents and the parents have to play the role of young people. We are going to try hard to put ourselves in the other's shoes and see the situation from the other person's perspective, and at the same time, how you can avoid escalating the situation and making it worse.'

7. After each role-play, talk with participants and make a list of what the participants did to reach a solution that both parties could accept.

8. After all the role-plays, share Journal Resource Page 11.1 ('Communicating as a Family'), give the group a few minutes to read it, and ask the following Group Discussion Questions:

- What do you think about the list? Do you think some of the suggestions would really work? Which ones and why?
- Can you think of any situations in your life now where using some of these might help you communicate with each other?
-  Are  there  any  suggestions  that  you  think  would  not work as well? Why not?
- How can we remember to 'see through someone else's eyes' when we are angry with each other?
- What else can be done to address the common causes of disagreement between parents and children?

Close the activity by sharing the following Key

## Messages:

- 'Empathy means understanding a situation from another person's point of view. To do that, it is helpful to express our own feelings in a calm way, such as 'I can see that you are very busy…' or 'I feel frustrated about what happened…' or 'I want to understand what is bothering you.' Communicating our feelings in a constructive way allows the other person to see the situation from our eyes.'
- 'Communicating our feelings is a very important way of resolving conflict and can even help us to avoid conflict in the first place. It is also more effective than using violence.'
- 'Conflict always exists, but it does not need to be violent  or  angry  and  can  be  an  opportunity  for  personal growth and development rather than an opportunity for violence.  When  we  communicate  with  each  other,  we can resolve conflict peacefully and avoid future conflict.'

## Part 4: Construction Project, Again (20 minutes)

1. Tell participants: 'Now that we have improved and developed our family communication skills, we are going to have another round of applying them in real life. We are going to build a second tower, like we did before. But this time, think very carefully and consciously about how your family works together as a team and how you can communicate effectively to be successful. Using the techniques we have just talked about, let's see who can build the tallest tower.'
2. Pass out 'connectors' and 'blocks' again to everyone, this time only 15 'blocks' per family but still as many connectors.
3. Give participants 10 minutes to build. As before, facilitators should walk around observing family dynamics and how well  communication skills  are  being  used  compared  to  before.
4. After 10 minutes, ask everyone to stop. Ask each group to present their tower and have it measured by the facilitators.

## Part 5: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Active Listening. During this exercise, they will be concentrating fully on one song.
2. Pick a song and have it ready to play on a phone or speakers.
3. Ask the participants to close their eyes and listen closely to the music.
4. Explain that they should follow the lyrics, notice the different  instruments,  or  take  in  the  song  as  a  whole  experience. If they have heard the song before, they should listen for something they haven't ever noticed before: What are the new sounds and lyrics that you are hearing? What are they trying to tell you?
5. Play the music.

## Part 6: Weekly Commitment

(5 minutes)

Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'Do something as a family that you haven't ever done before.'

## Part 7: Closing and Check-Out

(5 minutes)

1.  Thank  all  participants  for  sharing  their  thoughts,  questions, concerns, and experiences today.

## Ask the group:

- What did you think about what we discussed today?
- Do you have any questions about the session or things you would like to add?
2.  After  finishing  with  the  questions  and  other  comments, express appreciation for the environment of respect and trust they have sustained throughout the session and encourage participants to take part in future meetings.
3. Remind the group about confidentiality and the importance of keeping what is said during the group sessions within the group.
4.  Confirm  the  time,  date,  and  place  of  the  next  session  if there are any changes.

## Preparation:

- Make sure you are familiar with the content of the session and spend a few minutes discussing it  with the youth session facilitators who will be cofacilitating today. Make sure you are all  on  the  same  page  about  how  the  session should go.
- Take  a  few  moments  to  think  about  your  vision for your family and times when you have discussed your family vision with your partner and children so you can share your own experiences with the group as well. If you have not done this before, take some time to do so in the week leading up to the session.
- Before  the  activity  starts,  prepare  some  flipchart papers with the 'Y' diagram from Journal  Resource  Page  5.1  ('Our  Lives  Apart  and Together'). Draw the 'Y' on enough flipchart papers so each family can have one. Make the dotted part at the bottom the biggest part so that it stretches down the whole bottom half of the page.
- Literacy Note: This activity requires some literacy/writing ability, so be aware and mindful of participants' levels of literacy. If you feel one or more group members will struggle, explore alternative ways for them to complete the activity.

2. Ask the group: 'Does anyone have a fun parenting story to share? Something successful you did, something funny your child  did  or  said,  or  something  they  did  that  you  are  proud of?'

## Ask the group the following questions and invite a few volunteers to share:

## How are you?

Has anything new happened since the last session?

Did  you  talk  to  anyone  about  the  issues  discussed  in the group?

3. Ask about last week's commitment: 'Was anyone able to do something together as a family that they hadn't done together? If so, how did it go?'
4. After a few volunteers have shared, thank them for sharing their experiences and explain that the group will now begin the first activity.

## Part 2: Our Family Vision

(55 minutes)

1. Explain that in this activity, each person will think about the goals they have for their family, and together, each family will create a shared vision for the future.
2. Ask the participants to close their eyes. Read the following statements aloud slowly so that the group members can consider each sentence as you read them.

## 'Imagine it is five years from now…'

- 'What are the things you hope to have achieved in that time?'
- 'What do you hope for yourself?'
- 'For the adults, what do you hope for your partner and for  your  children?  For  the  young  people,  what  do  you hope for your parents?'
- 'For the adults, what do your relationships with your partner and your children look like? For the young people, what do your relationships with your parents and your siblings look like?'
- 'How do you care for each other? How do you help each other?'
- 'How do you speak to and listen to each other?'
3.  Ask  the  participants  to  keep  their  eyes  closed  and  think about this vision for the future and what it looks like.
4. After a few minutes, ask the participants to get into family groups  and  each  share  their  vision  for  the  family.  Starting with the female partner, followed by the children, and then the father, each person should take a few minutes and describe their vision for the family. During that time, the other family members should sit quietly and listen to what is being shared.
5.  After  everyone  has  shared  their  vision  with  their  family, ask everyone to come back to the circle.

<!-- image -->

## Ask the group:

- How did it feel to share your vision with your family?
- How did it feel to listen to the vision of others in your family?
- When you shared your family visions,  were  your  visions similar or different?
- Was anything surprising?
6. Next, ask each family to sit together and come up with two or three long-term goals they want their family to achieve. If they prefer, participants can write these goals down on paper or draw them, but this is not required.
7. Now, pass out the flipchart papers with the 'Family History' and 'Future 'Y'' on them, one to each family. Ask the parents to turn to Journal Resource Page 5.1 ('Our Lives Apart and Together'), which they completed in an earlier session.
8.  Now,  ask  the  family  to  fill  out  the  'Family  History'  and 'Future 'Y'' sections as a family. The parents can add a few things from what they already had, but make sure that the children  are  able  to  add  their  milestones  as  well.  The  emphasis should be on the future and what everyone hopes to achieve (the dotted line toward the bottom). They can write or draw what their vision for the future looks like.
9. Finally, each person should discuss what kind of support or assistance they will need from the other members of the family or community to accomplish their goals. It is important that families don't only focus on financial support.
10. After families have completed discussing their long-term goals, ask if any family feels comfortable sharing their family vision with the group.
- 11.Allow  enough  time  for  participants  who  want  to  share their  family  vision  to  do  so.  Remember,  sharing  is  not  required.

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through

Facilitator Note: After each family has shared, you may invite  other  participants  to  provide  positive,  constructive feedback on group members' visions, guided by the group agreements.

Ask  some  of  the  following Group  Discussion  Questions:

- Is it common for men and women to discuss the vision they have for their family's future and how they can work together to achieve it? Why or why not?
- How common is it for parents and children to discuss a vision for the family's future? Why might it be beneficial to do this more?
-  How  important  is  it  for  men  and  women  to  have  a shared vision and work together for the development and well-being of the family?
- Do you think this exercise will be helpful to your family?
-  Do  traditional  gender  roles,  or  expectations  of  how men and women should behave, make it difficult for men and women to achieve their family vision? If so, how?
-  How  can  men's  participation  in  caring  for  children and doing household chores help to achieve the family vision?
- How can your participation in these meetings help to achieve your family vision?

12. Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Share the Key Message: 'Communication among family members is important to setting goals for your family and supporting  each  other  to  achieve  them  together.  Men  and women working together as a couple - such as supporting each other to work, sharing household responsibilities, and encouraging each other as parents - can help you to achieve these goals and support the health, happiness, and economic prosperity of your family. And bringing your children into the discussion, hearing their hopes and dreams, can help clarify that  vision  and  make  it  easier  for  parents  to  support  their children.'

## Part 3: Mindfulness Activity (5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called the Beats Listening Game. During this exercise, you'll be concentrating on the sounds you'll make as a group.

## Part 4: Weekly Commitment

(5 minutes)

Explain the Weekly Commitment: 'This week, agree on one action that you can take, as a family, to work toward achieving your long-term goals and vision for your family. It does not have to be a large or difficult action. Think of what you can do to help take a small step forward. Each small step will help you along the path toward achieving your goals.'

It  is important  to  take  time  to  appreciate  the  changes  we  have made and to commit ourselves to continuing this process of positive change.'
3. Explain that each couple, if they feel comfortable doing so, will have the opportunity to share with the group what impact the group sessions have had on their own family and relationships. They can talk about how the group has helped them to work better together and make changes in their family. They can provide individual or joint reflections. If the group is very large, this can be done in smaller groups (ensuring that couples are together in the same group).
4.  Ask  which  couple  would like to volunteer to go first. Explain that each couple will have as much time as they need to share. They can decide what they would like to share with the group, but it can include:
- What personal changes you have made in your lives
- How your family and community have been involved in this change
- What rewards or benefits you have seen from these changes (again, this can be shared individually or together)
- Any changes you plan to make in the future to further support your children's and your household's development
- What you both enjoyed in this group

Part 4: Celebrating Our Changes

(30 minutes)

1. Explain to the group that in this activity, couples will have

5. Ask for another volunteer couple, and continue until everyone who would like to share has had time to do so.

6. After everyone has shared their stories, ask if any of the participants  would  like  to  provide  feedback  to  those  who have shared their stories. These should be words of encouragement and support.

7. After any feedback has been provided, thank everyone for sharing and congratulate everyone on the important changes and steps they have made in their lives. Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the Key Message:

'This is only the beginning of the process of change. All of us can commit to being involved, caring, and supportive partners who have equitable relationships and share power  and  decision-making.  When  men  and  women work together side by side, they can better ensure the well-being of their household and achieve the common goals they have for the family. By working together, men and women can achieve happy, successful, and economically productive families. This change can be sustained and expanded through the support and commitment of all of those here today. I encourage all of you to continue to support each other, and seek support from your family and community, in making positive changes.'

## Part 4: Celebrating Our Changes

(30 minutes)

1. Explain to the group that in this activity, couples will have an opportunity to create an action plan of positive changes they would like to make and any plans they have for the future.

2. Tell the group:

'All of you have made a lot of personal growth and changes over these 13 sessions. As we discussed before, change is a gradual process. It is important to reflect on the changes we have made - where we have come from - and where we would like to be in the future. Even after this group has finished, you can continue to make positive changes that will improve your lives and relationships in ways that will benefit yourselves, your partners, your children, and your community.'

<!-- image -->

3. Ask everyone to close their eyes and think back to the earlier  session  when  they  developed a family vision and refer back to those plans:

'Remember the vision you imagined for your family and the long-term  goals  you  identified.  Remember  the  things  you hoped to have achieved in five years. The things you hoped for  yourself,  your  relationships  with  your  partner,  and  your children. Think about the vision you had for your family. What do you need to maintain the positive changes you have already made? What commitments are you making to your partner and your children? And, based on the changes you have already made, what other changes do you need to make, or actions do you need to take, to achieve this vision?'

4.  Ask  everyone  to  open  their  eyes  but  keep  this  vision  in their minds. Provide participants with four or five notecards and ask them to write down one action per card that they can do in the next six months to move them toward realizing this vision. (Optional: If you'd like to make this more artistic, you can bring in art supplies and create an art project to display their commitments to action instead.)

5. After everyone has finished, have them go around the circle and share at least one or two actions that they will adopt over the next six months. Note that participants should also think  of  ways  that  the  other  group  members  can  help  and support them in making positive changes.

## After everyone has had a chance to speak, open a discussion using the following Group Discussion Questions:

- What excites you about these actions you are putting in place to help realize your vision for your family?
- Do you have any fears or worries about moving forward with these changes?
- How can the participants in this group help each other  to  successfully  implement  and  sustain  the  positive changes you have made?
- What can you as individuals, a couple, or a family do to  help  others  in  the  community progress as we have? What can this group do collectively to help others in the community?

Part 5: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through

Thank the participants for sharing their experiences and ideas. Close the activity by sharing the Key Message:

'All of you should be proud of the positive changes you have  made in  your  lives.  Identifying  our  goals  and  the changes we need to make to achieve them is an important  step  in  realizing  the  vision  we  have  for  ourselves and for our families. The things you have learned in this group and the people you have met here will support you in continuing to make positive changes that will benefit you, your partners, and your families.'

## Part 5: Mindfulness Activity

(5 minutes)

1. Tell the participants that you will be leading them through a mindfulness activity called Body Scan. During this activity, you will be having them close their eyes or soften their gaze and walking them through an activity in which they will be able to take some time and pay attention to what their body is feeling. Then, read the script:

Begin by making yourself comfortable. Sit in a chair and allow your back to be straight, but not stiff, with your feet on the ground. You could also do this practice standing or if you prefer, you can lie down and have your head supported. Your hands could be resting gently in your lap or at your side. Allow your eyes to close, or to remain open with a soft gaze.

Take  several  long,  slow,  deep  breaths.  Breathing  in  fully and exhaling slowly. Breathe in through your nose and out through your nose or mouth. Feel your stomach expand on an inhale and relax and let go as you exhale.

Begin to let go of noises around you. Begin to shift your attention from outside to inside yourself. If you are distracted by sounds in the room, simply notice this and bring your focus back to your breathing.

Now slowly  bring  your  attention  down  to  your  feet.  Begin observing  sensations  in  your  feet.  You  might  want  to  wiggle  your  toes  a  little,  feeling  your  toes  against  your  socks or shoes. Just notice, without judgment. You might imagine sending  your  breath  down  to  your  feet,  as  if  the  breath  is traveling through the nose to the lungs and through the abdomen all the way down to your feet. And then back up again out through your nose and lungs. Perhaps you don't feel anything at all. That is fine, too. Just allow yourself to feel the sensation of not feeling anything.

<!-- image -->

When you are ready, allow your feet to dissolve in your mind's eye and move your attention up to your ankles, calves, knees and  thighs.  Observe  the  sensations  you  are  experiencing throughout  your  legs.  Breathe  into  and  breathe  out  of  the legs. If your mind begins to wander during this exercise, gently notice this without judgment and bring your mind back to noticing the sensations in your legs. If you notice any discomfort, pain or stiffness, don't judge this. Just simply notice it. Observe  how  all  sensations  rise  and  fall,  shift  and  change moment to moment. Notice how no sensation is permanent. Just observe and allow the sensations to be in the moment, just as they are. Breathe into and out from the legs.

Then on the next out breath, allow the legs to dissolve in your mind. And move to the sensations in your lower back and pelvis. Softening and releasing as you breathe in and out. Slowly move your attention up to your mid back and upper back. Become curious about the sensations here. You may become aware of sensations in the muscle, temperature or points of contact with furniture.…With each outbreath, you may let go of tension you are carrying. And then very gently shift your focus to your stomach and all the internal organs here. Perhaps you notice the feeling of clothing, the process of digestion or the belly rising or falling with each breath. If you notice opinions arising about these areas, gently let these go and return to noticing sensations. As you continue to breathe, bring your awareness to the chest and heart region and just notice your heartbeat. Observe how the chest rises during the inhale and how the chest falls during the exhale. Let go of any judgments that may arise. On the next outbreath, shift the focus to your hands and fingertips. See if you can channel your breathing into and out of this area as if you are breathing into and out from your hands. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the sensations in your hands.

And then, on the next outbreath, shift the focus and bring your awareness up into your arms. Observe the sensations or lack of sensations that may be occurring there. You might notice some difference between the left arm and the right arm - no need to judge this. As you exhale, you may experience the arm  soften  and  release  tensions.  Continue  to  breathe  and shift focus to the neck, shoulder and throat region. This is an area where we often have tension. Be with the sensations here. It could be tightness, rigidity or holding. You may notice the  shoulders  moving  along  with  the  breath.  Let  go  of  any thoughts  or  stories  you  are  telling  about  this  area.  As  you breathe, you may feel tension rolling off your shoulders.

Part 6: Closing and Check-Out

(5 minutes)

1. Thank participants again for their participation in the

On the next outbreath, shift your focus and direct your attention  to  the  scalp,  head  and  face.  Observe  all  of  the  sensations occurring there. Notice the movement of the air as you breathe into or out of the nostrils or mouth. As you exhale, you  might  notice  the  softening  of  any  tension  you  may  be holding.

And now, let your attention to expand out to include the entire  body as a whole. Bring into your awareness the top of your head down to the bottom of your toes. Feel the gentle rhythm of the breath as it moves through the body. As you come to the end of this practice, take a full, deep breath, taking in all the energy of this practice. Exhale fully. And when you are ready, open your eyes and return your attention to the present moment.

As you become fully alert and awake, consider setting the intention that this practice of building awareness will benefit everyone you come in contact with today.

Script  written  by  Shilagh  Mirgain,  PhD,  for  UW  Cultivating Well-Being: A Neuroscientific Approach.

<!-- image -->

## Part 6: Closing and Check-Out

(5 minutes)

1.  Thank  participants  again  for  their  participation  in  the group over the past several weeks. Encourage them to continue learning, listening, and practicing their new skills.
2.  Ask  participants,  if  they  have  not  already,  to  exchange contact information so that they can continue communicating with each other now that the group has been completed. Suggest they set up a WhatsApp group so that they can continue the conversation online.
3.  Hand  out  certificates  of  completion  (optional)  and  close the group with one final check-out.

## Appendix A: Sample Energizers and Icebreakers

<!-- image -->

## Ha, Ha

Begin by having all the players sit in  a  circle.  Tell  all  of the players they have to remain as solemn and serious as they can throughout the game. Pick one player to start the game by  saying  'Ha'  once.  The  player  standing  next  to them says the word 'Ha' twice. Following this pattern, the third player says 'Ha' three times. As the game progresses, eliminate any players who laugh or make noise when it is not their turn. The player who avoids laughing throughout the game wins.

<!-- image -->

## The Stomp

Ask everyone to stand in a circle. Teach them a three-count stomp  pattern  and  do  it  together  (for  example:  stompstomp-clap, stomp-stomp-clap). Then, teach them a fourcount pattern (like stomp-stomp-stomp-clap, stomp-stompstomp-clap). Divide the participants into two groups. Have one group do the first pattern and the second group do the second pattern. If there is more time, you can have individuals create their own patterns for the group to imitate.

<!-- image -->

## Get in Motion

Ask group members to stand. Ask them to shake their right arm, then their left arm, then their right leg, and then their left  leg.  Now, tell participants that you will count to ten while they shake each limb. They will shake their right arm ten times, then their left arm ten times, followed by their right leg ten times, and their left leg ten times - you can count out loud for each limb. As soon as participants have shaken each limb ten times, go through the cycle again, but  only  count  to  nine.  Proceed,  counting  to  eight,  then seven, then six, then five, and so on until participants only shake each limb once. To make the energizer more exciting, you can count faster and faster as you go.

## The Shrinking Iceberg

Put a blanket or several sheets of newspaper on the floor. Ask the group to stand on it. Then, explain that this is an iceberg that is melting away, reducing in size by half every month. Their object is to see how long they can all stay on it. Ask them to get off it and fold the blanket in half or remove half the paper. Repeat, each time reducing the area by half, and see how they can find ways to support each other to allow everyone to stay on.

3. When we feel angry, we often resort to behavior that can be aggressive, hurtful, or violent. This might happen even before we realize it as a reaction that for some people is instant and manifests as yelling and throwing things across the room or hitting something or someone. At other times, we may get depressed, isolate ourselves, or remain silent. Now that you're rethinking the scenario in which you were angry, how did that anger manifest? How did you behave? Write a sentence or a few words about your actions.

## Journal Resource Page 9.1: Information About Young Teens

## Developmental Milestones

This is a time of many physical, mental, emotional, and social changes.…They might be worried about these changes and how they are looked at by others. This also will be a time when your teen might face peer pressure to use alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs, and to have sex. Other challenges can be eating disorders, depression, and family problems. At this age, teens make more of their own choices about friends, sports,  studying,  and  school.  They  become  more  independent, with their own personality and interests, although parents are still very important.

## Emotional/Social Changes

Children in this age group might:

- Show more concern about body image, looks, and clothes.
- Focus on themselves, going back and forth between high expectations and lack of confidence.
- Experience more moodiness.
- Show more interest in and influence by peer group.
- Express less affection toward parents; sometimes might seem rude or short-tempered.
- Feel stress from more challenging schoolwork.
- Develop eating problems.
-  Feel  a  lot  of  sadness  or  depression, which can lead to poor grades at school, alcohol or drug use, unsafe sex, and other problems.

## Thinking and Learning

Children in this age group might:

- Have more ability for complex thought.
- Be better able to express feelings through talking.
- Develop a stronger sense of right and wrong.

<!-- image -->

## Healthy Bodies

-  Encourage your teen to be physically active. She might join  a  team  sport  or  take  up  an  individual  sport.  Helping with household tasks such as mowing the lawn, walking the dog, or washing the car also will keep your teen active.
- Mealtime is very important for families. Eating together helps teens make better choices about the foods they eat, promotes healthy weight, and gives your family members time to talk with each other.
- Keep television sets out of your teen's bedroom. Set limits for screen time, including cell phones, computers, video games, and other devices, and develop a family media plan.

## Journal Resource Page 10.2: Positive Parenting Techniques

The type of discipline a parent uses influences the type of adult  that  a  young  man  or  woman  becomes.  What  type  of discipline do you use? What type of person do you want your child to be? The following are a few positive parenting techniques that you can use with your child:

· Be firm. Clearly and firmly state, or even demand, that the child does what needs to be done. Speak in a tone that lets your child know that you mean what you say and that you expect the child to do as they are told. Being firm doesn't mean yelling, nagging, threatening, reasoning, or taking away privileges.  Keep  suggestions  to  a  minimum,  and  always  speak kindly, even when speaking firmly.

- Manage behavior. Talk with them calmly to learn what caused a disagreement. Then, talk about ways to deal with it. Come to a solution that's agreeable to both of you. This helps children learn to be responsible for their behavior.
- Stay in control. Act before the situation gets out of control -- before you get angry and overly frustrated and before the child's behavior becomes unreasonable.

· Praise. Give more attention (and praise) for good behavior and less for bad behavior. Don't make punishment a reward. Let them know that you appreciate a good attitude and cooperation. Young people respond positively to genuine respect and praise.

· Prevent. Look  for  ways  to  head  off  a  dispute  before  it starts  by  thinking  about  your  child's  habits  and  needs  and what has caused conflict in the past. For instance, if your adolescent becomes grumpy and argumentative when hungry, make sure they always have plenty to eat, even offering food unprompted because you know they need to eat. If there is a particular issue or thing that sets them off, look for ways to avoid it or to prepare them to deal with it when it happens.

· Cool down for them. When young people are misbehaving, tell them that they are misbehaving and suggest another activity or just get them to stop what they should not be doing. Then, give them some time and space before bringing it up to discuss why it was a problem and what the alternative are.

- Cool  down  for  you. If  you  find  yourself  getting  angry and wanting to shout or use violence, and it is safe to do so, sometimes the best solution  can  be  to  leave  the  room,  go outside, or just take a minute to cool down before dealing with the child's misbehavior. Even just a minute or two can help you regain your composure and think of the best way to address a situation.

## A Note on Children's Anger

From Positive Discipline in Everyday Parenting by Joan E. Durrant, PhD (Save the Children, 2016)

One of the major tasks of childhood is learning how to manage and express emotions. This is a difficult task because emotions can sometimes keep us from thinking clearly. Emotions can lead us to act impulsively, saying things we wouldn't otherwise say or doing things we wouldn't otherwise do.

For a child to understand emotions and to be able to manage them and express them in a positive way is a huge task.

Sometimes children's emotions overwhelm them. Just as they had tantrums in the early years, they might have angry outbursts  in  the  middle  years.  Or  they  might  simply  be  silent, unable, or afraid to express how they feel.

## Generations for Change - Parents Curriculum

©Tch

At these times they need to know that they are safe and loved. It's not really possible to have a calm conversation with your child when he is very angry. The best thing to do is to simply stay nearby, letting your child know through your actions that you are there if she needs you.

Once the storm has passed, you can talk about the issue and, by staying calm, you can show your child how to express feelings in a positive way. You can also show her ways of finding solutions to the problem that led to the outburst.

Remember that emotional storms do pass. And each one provides an opportunity to be a role model for your child.

## Journal Resource Page 11.1: Communicating as a Family

## Suggestions for Young People:

- Talk for yourself. Don't let others talk for you. No one will express your thoughts, feelings, or ideas as well as you.
-  Work  on  controlling  your  body  language:  Rolling  eyes, heavy sighing, and other emotional reactions take your parent's attention away from what you are saying.
- If upset, take time to cool down before trying to talk. We don't talk, think, or hear clearly when we are upset.
- Think about what it would be like to be your parent. This won't  change  what  you  want,  but  it  helps  you  understand your  parent's  reactions.  That  can  help  you  calm  down  and speak more clearly.

## Suggestions for Parents:

- Listen to your teen before responding. Let them know you heard what they said, consider it, and then respond.
- Remember what it was like when you were a teen. This can help you understand their situation without setting aside your job as their parent.
- Know that the best communication can happen on the spur of  the  moment,  when  you  are  on  your  way  somewhere  or grabbing a bite to eat. Take advantage of those times together and talk.
- Remember that young people are in the midst of figuring out what they want and learning how to manage their newly intense emotions. They need time and experience to accomplish these tasks, and so set your expectations appropriately.
- Let  your  teen  know  about  the  mistakes  you  have  made. Just because you did something as a teen does not give them license to do the same thing.
-  Remember  that  you  had  to  learn  many  things  by  doing them.
- Put aside the teacher role once in a while. Listen to their opinion and ideas, recognizing that they aren't going to act on every idea.

<!-- image -->

## Suggestions for Both:

- Time your conversations. Don't wait until you are upset; don't try to talk when you are busy, tired or hungry or when your parents/children are busy, tired, or hungry.
- Begin your statements with the word 'I,' not 'you'; for example, 'I feel hurt when you talk to me like that' rather than 'You never talk to me like I am human.'
- Ask 'why' they said something or made a decision rather than assuming why. Then, respond based on that explanation.
- Pay attention to your reaction inside. If you're upset, take time to cool down. We don't talk or hear very well when we are upset.
- Show respect for each other's uniqueness. Once in a while, put aside the fact they are your parent/child and listen like they are someone else.
- Say you are sorry when you have done something wrong.
- Admit it when the other person is or may be right or when they may have a better idea.
- Show your appreciation for each other. Notice what each is doing right.
- Be aware of your tone of voice and leave the attitude outside. If  you  can't,  take  time  to  cool  down  before beginning the conversation.
- Do it the other person's way once in a while.
