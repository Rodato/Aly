## About Global Communities (GC)

Global Communities is a global development organization founded in San Diego in 1961 working in more than a dozen countries across Asia, Africa, and the Americas, including the United States. In 2019 alone, Global Communities impacted the lives of 21 million people around the world. Global Communities' mission is to drive innovation from the ground up to enhance health, end hunger, overcome hardship, and advance women and girls - resulting in meaningful and measurable change in people's lives.

Project Concern International (PCI) merged with Global Communities in April 2020 to expand the reach of proven programs and scale solutions for transformational change alongside vulnerable communities around the world. Global Communities has worked toward positive and sustainable change in more than 35 countries, in collaboration with a wide range of public- and private-sector partners, including communities directly affected by poverty, disasters, and conflict.

Women Empowered (WE) is a Global Communities global initiative dedicated to the economic, social, and political empowerment of women through the formation of self-managed and self-sustaining savings groups. WE groups are formed based upon proven savings groups methodologies that bring 15 to 25 members together to save money, develop financial literacy, make loans to one another, and invest in income-generating activities. Beyond that, WE groups empower women by building skills and capacities; providing leadership experience to build self-esteem and self-efficacy; increasing access to information and resources; and promoting collective action and community organizing. WE groups become a platform for members to raise awareness on important topics and act individually and collectively to improve their lives and communities.

## 1. Introduction

This manual is designed to engage the husbands/partners of women participants in Global Communities' Women Empowered (WE) program who already take part in that program with their wives/partners, both in Guatemala and across the region. The Journeys of Transformation Dialogue Clubs program 1  is intended to complement the existing WE program curriculum in order to engage men as more equitable and supportive partners in improving household well-being and women's participation in economic activities. This manual is adapted from Equimundo's Journeys of Transformation manual, first developed with CARE Rwanda and Rwamrec and then with Global Communities, but which also includes additional content based on the priorities that emerged in formative research and adaptations by other programs that promote gender equality and women's leadership (e.g., Pathfinder's Act With Her and the Population Council's Abriendo Oportunidades).

The manual should be used by men and women facilitators working with the WE program. It includes 13 sessions to enable men and women to reflect on issues of gender and power and on how these influence their relationships, their families, and their well-being. The session content is highly interactive and dynamic. It uses participants' experiences to generate individual and collective reflection that, in turn, can motivate the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors. It aims to build collective support for making positive, healthy changes in their relationships as a couple, in the family, and in their lives.

THE J OURNEYS OF TRANSFORMATION DIALOGUE CLUBS PROGRAM OBJECTIVES ARE TO:

-  Promote gender-equitable attitudes and support for women's autonomy and leadership, recognizing their right to make decisions about their bodies, lives, families, and management of household resources
-  Promote men's support and equitable attitudes toward women's income generation
-  Encourage men to share the responsibility for childcare and domestic work in the family
-  Support couples in creating a household budget and discuss how men and women can make financial decisions that ensure their sons' and daughters' wellbeing
-  Allow men and women participants to recognize the different forms of violence against women and against children, as well as to understand how violence is sustained by power imbalances and gender inequality and the harmful consequences it has for those who experience it
-  Promote attitudes and shared beliefs that reject violence in the home as a way to discipline or resolve conflicts among women and men
-  Strengthen effective couple communication and anger management skills and create healthy, nonviolent relationships
-  Increase knowledge, safe communication, and balanced decision-making about sexual and reproductive health and family planning

The manual was designed by Equimundo in collaboration with Global Communities (previously known as PCI) and is based on formative research carried out jointly with Global Communities staff in Huehuetenango, Guatemala, as well as with men and women participants in the WE program and others from communities where this program was to be implemented.

During the formative research, many women expressed willingness to see their male partners participate jointly with them in a program that would improve family relationships and encourage the men to support their economic activities. Men indicated they were open to participating in programming to help them improve the economic status and well-being of their families. Both men and women identified key topics they wanted to learn more about and welcomed the opportunity to discuss these as a couple. The most relevant topics identified were: 1) decision-making and how work is divided among men and women in the household; 2) talking about sexual and reproductive health as a couple; and 3) managing economic household resources as a family. Men remarked that while there were several spaces within development programs for women to meet with other women and share experiences, there were far fewer opportunities for men to do the same. Men expressed a desire to create similar spaces for men to meet with other men and discuss the challenges they face in improving their household's social and economic situation. As a result, this manual is designed to engage men - alongside their partners - in promoting the health, economic development, and well-being of the household, with a focus on strengthening communication skills to promote healthy, equitable, and nonviolent couple relationships and, thus, enhance the quality of the family environment.

## Recommendations to Encourage Men's Participation in the Program 2

When recruiting men to join a Journeys of Transformation group, it is important to emphasize how the group will support men in achieving the goals they have for their household and in improving the economic situation of their family. This can be framed in the following way:

'Many men in this community face problems and challenges in ensuring the well-being and success of their households and meeting the economic, social, and health needs of their families. In this group, men will have an opportunity to talk with other men and learn from what they are experiencing and ways to improve the economic situation of the household. Men and women will also learn to work together to achieve a healthier, more balanced, productive household in which men's, women's, and children's needs are considered and supported.'

Some additional recommendations and guidance that can help the GC program team and facilitators when recruiting and encouraging men to participate are to:

- Ensure that the physical location for group sessions is accessible for both men and women participants and that the sessions take their work schedules into consideration. When planning meetings and group sessions, select spaces that are easy to get to (e.g., consider distance, availability, and cost of transportation) and consider the timing and seasonality of agricultural or other work that participants are involved in. Holding sessions in the evenings or on weekends tends to work better to accommodate men's schedules and those of their partners. 1.

2.   Recommendations are adapted from Promundo-US &amp; Plan International Canada. (2020). Recruitment and retention of male participants in gendertransformative programs: Promundo, and from practice-based learning from engaging men in women's economic empowerment and fatherhood programs around the world.

- Understand participants' background and specific circumstances to address their reality, increase recruitment, and minimize dropout. Men who migrate for work over long periods or who have low levels of literacy can become discouraged from participating in the program if they believe it will clash with their work or require lots of reading and writing. If the group has low literacy levels, you can use illustrations and images throughout the program activities and ask them to draw instead of write wherever possible. 2
- When encouraging men to join, highlight the personal and family benefits that can result from actively participating in the program. You can mention that as a result of taking part in this program, many men and their families were able to improve their physical, mental, and sexual health and their relationships with their partners and children, and they were able to create happier and healthier homes. 3
- Appeal to men's hopes and dreams as fathers and partners. Understanding what men's goals are for themselves, as well as for their children and partners, can help you create effective recruitment messages. Use a strengths-based approach that focuses on building on and recognizing men's and fathers' existing knowledge and things they care about. In the conversations and group activities with men, link the manual's key messages with men and their partners' daily experiences. Share ideas on how they can support women's decisionmaking and leadership in the community and how to value their partner's right to make decisions about her body, life, finances, and family. 4
- Share examples of men who have supported women in their processes of personal and economic empowerment and how that has positively impacted their quality of life. Drawing on filmed or recorded testimonies can be a good method for doing so. 5
- Acknowledge that raising a family is challenging and that it is important to get support from others facing similar issues. You can mention that they will learn how to support their children to grow up confident and healthy, ways to address parenting challenges, how to communicate effectively with children and partners, how to manage their own difficult emotions (such as anger or frustration), and nonviolent ways of resolving conflicts within the family. 6
- Recruit men through the most commonly accessible channels of communication. After consulting women participants from WE to ensure they agree with their partner's participation in group sessions, use the most common channel to reach potential participants: leaflets and posters at the community center; radio announcements; telephone; platforms like WhatsApp; and word of mouth through community members or leaders, school board authorities, and Global Communities WE facilitators. 7
- Generate spaces for community participation and mobilization beyond the sessions. Couples who complete the program (or are about to complete it) and who are open and willing to do so can share their stories of transformative change at community meetings or other events. These events can be opportunities to disseminate important messages about equality in the home and women's leadership and to promote dialogue about these and other key topics. 8
- Plan for 'family days.' Many men and women appreciate the opportunity to participate in programs as couples or families. In addition to creating couples sessions, create quality spaces for families by scheduling sessions in which household members can practice positive behaviors, create a family vision (goals for the family), and/or develop a budget. This can be a powerful way to engage the entire family and reinforce the program messages. 9

The same strategies just outlined to encourage men's participation in the program can also be used to recruit women from the WE program into the Dialogue Clubs before reaching out to their partners.

THE FOLLOWING KEY MESSAGES CAN BE USED TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET WOMEN:

w

-  Emphasize how men's participation will foster their support for women's leadership, decision-making, savings, and investment, as well as women's involvement in the WE program overall.
-  Emphasize how men's participation will promote open communication for couples and create opportunities for women to voice - in a safe way - their personal hopes, dreams, and concerns.
-  Highlight how this program will provide helpful information about women's sexual and reproductive health and create opportunities for couples to talk about family planning and contraception.
-  Ask how they would like the program's content to be tailored to fit their own challenges and realities.
-  Think creatively (and in line with your budget) about how to manage childcare for those who have young children, such as encouraging them to bring the children to the group, arranging group childcare so that parents can participate without worrying, or holding the groups at a time when childcare can be arranged (especially for the sessions that will involve couples' participation).

## 2. Key Findings From Formative Research

In March 2020, formative research was carried out by Equimundo and Global Communities with women and men from communities in Cuilco, Huehuetenango, to learn more about the sociocultural context and the gender and power dynamics operating in two communities. These two communities were chosen because the WE initiative participants and their husbands or partners lived there. The study revealed patterns of gender, shared beliefs, and expectations on gender roles concerning caregiving, participation in economic activities, and decision-making that informed the adaptation of this manual. The key findings are summarized in this section.

## Theme 1: Attitudes and Social Norms About Gender Roles in the Economic, Domestic, and Social Spheres

Interviewees associated men with being authority figures and financial providers, placing them hierarchically as superior to women and children and in control of the household. Men interviewed mentioned having difficulty expressing and talking about their emotions and feelings, as well as being resorting to violence when they experience anger or frustration or if they feel humiliated when their wife and children disrespect them. Men also believe in gendered stereotypes concerning women's vulnerability and the supposed risks women face when they venture outside their home (for example, on roads or in the street). To protect their wives, men see themselves as responsible for protecting women, and in doing so, indirectly justify restricting women's mobility and activities outside the home. According to some men, this protective and dominant role also legitimizes men's use of violence against their partners. Not everyone agreed, however. Women interviewed challenged men's use of violence and affirmed the right of men and women to enjoy the same rights, opportunities, and participation in decision-making.

## Theme 2: Caregiving, Fatherhood, and Domestic Work

Gender stereotypes are also deeply engrained in relation to expected roles concerning caregiving and domestic work. Beyond being the main economic providers, the men interviewed do not see themselves as having a role in caring for children or other dependent relatives, and men are perceived as only being capable of carrying out caregiving or domestic work when women become sick. Caregiving and domestic tasks are learned and taught in the family from generation to generation (e.g., from grandmothers to mothers and to other women in the family), and these tasks continue to be imposed on women as their sole responsibility. Their 'failure' to fulfill this role results in shaming and social sanctioning (i.e., they suffer discrimination, ridicule, or accusations of failing to live up to expectations, and sometimes, violence by their spouse). Women interviewed think it is important for husbands/partners to participate in domestic work at home, take care of their children, and learn about the economic initiatives that they are

developing. They welcomed the idea of their husbands/partners becoming informed and supporting and getting involved in the WE program.

In the interviews, younger men came across as more open-minded and reported taking on some caregiving responsibilities for their children. However, they are strongly reluctant to carry out domestic work.

## Theme 3: Perceptions of WE

Women and men interviewed said they value the WE program as an initiative that helps the whole family. According to them, money is not misspent but is used by the family to cover costs related to illness or can serve as a loan to start new businesses. They perceive WE as a program that helps them identify the needs that exist in the community and the responses and possible solutions to some of those needs through the women's groups. However, even though women had been exposed to three types of empowerment in this program (political, economic, and social), they did not see how these concepts - such as having more decision-making power and other forms of autonomy - apply to their lives. In addition, they did not seem to embrace or feel entitled to the right to make decisions within these three spheres, still believing in and perpetuating restrictive gender attitudes and norms. It is clear that women would benefit from the opportunity to critically reflect on the power imbalances and the beliefs and social norms that sustain unequal relationships between men and women in their communities. Through women's engagement in gender-transformative programming, there is an opportunity for women to feel and demand recognition and to be valued, to have knowledge of their rights as the foundation for their personal development and dignity, and to take an active leadership role in the community.

## 3. Organization of the Manual

The manual is structured into 13 sessions, organized around four core modules or themes:

<!-- image -->

| Exploring Gender and Power 1                         |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| Equality Inside and Outside theHome 2                |
| Sexual and Reproductive Health and Family Planning 3 |
| Working Together to Prevent Violence Against Women 4 |

Each session contains two or more activities, with group discussion questions to help participants reflect on key topics within the module. The sessions last approximately two hours each and are designed to complement, rather than replace or replicate, the information provided during the WE program meetings.

The activities in the sessions are designed to allow men, and their partners, to learn through self-reflection and participation - a process that is facilitated, not taught. The objective of the sessions is to initiate a process of critical thinking about gender, power, and rights and the possibilities for promoting more equitable relationships between women and men. The activities are effective in allowing men to share their own experiences and opinions.

The sessions are designed to be conducted by one or two trained facilitators. The first portion of each session includes an overview of the session, which will help the facilitators to plan, organize, and conduct each session. The overview for each session provides the following information:

## 4. Structure of the Sessions

Each session follows a similar structure or format:

## CHECK-IN

All sessions begin with a 'check-in' to welcome the participants and review what they learned in the previous session. The check-in lasts approximately 15 minutes and provides time for the participants to share how they fared in carrying out the weekly assignments they committed to.

ACTIVITIES

## CHECK-OUT

## WEEKLY COMMITMENT

Most sessions include two or three group activities. The activities are broken down into the following parts:

Title and Length: Indicates the title of each activity, which you may choose to share with the group. The recommended length of the activity is also indicated.

Purpose: States the specific objective of each activity. The facilitator should inform the participants of the purpose before starting a new activity.

Materials : Lists the materials needed to carry out the session (e.g., paper and markers) and suggests optional materials for some sessions.

Instructions: Lists the sequence of steps for carrying out the activity. The activities are written to be adapted for groups with different levels of reading and writing ability. The facilitator should be attentive to whether the steps are appropriate for the participants.

Group Discussion Questions: Suggests group discussion questions to help guide the discussion on the activity topic. These questions serve as guidance for the facilitator. It is not necessary to discuss all the questions or to adhere to the order in which they are listed.

Key Messages: Lists the key messages of an activity that should be emphasized during and after completing the activity.

There is a 15-minute 'check-out' at the end of the session, during which the facilitator can reinforce some of the key messages of the session and participants can share their feedback. The facilitator should encourage men and women to share what they have learned, any thoughts they have regarding the session, and how it will benefit them in their own lives.

This is an assignment to be given to the group after the 'check-out. ' Participants are expected to complete the assignment at home before the next session (except for the last session). Feedback on the assignments will be shared at the beginning of the next session if men and women feel comfortable doing so.

## 6. Message for Facilitators: About Your Role

The role of the facilitator is to create an open and respectful environment in which men and women can feel comfortable sharing and learning from each other. The activities are designed to allow participants to learn through self-reflection and participation - a process that is facilitated, not taught.

About half of the sessions are designed for men and women together. These sessions are designed to engage participants in critical reflection and to promote dialogue between men and women. Some activities may require men and women to participate in separate group discussions. This is done in order to make sure that both men and women feel comfortable and safe to express their ideas and opinions, particularly on issues that may be sensitive to discuss in front of their partner. Through these activities, men and women may begin to feel more comfortable communicating with each other.

In the sessions held separately with men, it is important for facilitators to provide a space for men to reflect on the power and privileges they have as men, to have the opportunity to share the challenges they face, and to learn from other men. As a facilitator, you should encourage the participants to share their own experiences in a nonjudgmental way, and you should never use their experiences to criticize.

Some of the themes - such as violence and sexuality - are complex and sensitive. You need to pay attention to the comfort level of the participants. In some cases, you may need to refer individuals to professional violence or mental health services or counseling. It is important to be sensitive to the practical realities of the lives of the group members and realize that they may encounter challenges or dangers when trying to make changes in their lives.

Remember, changing attitudes and behaviors is a long process. Participation in these activities will not necessarily lead to an immediate transformation of their lives and relationships. It is the beginning of a process for promoting personal change and transformation.

See yourself as a facilitator, not a teacher. Ask questions to better understand where participants are coming from and guide them in group reflections to critically look at harmful gender norms. You do not have to be a gender equality or sexual health expert and do not need to have all the answers. Rather, the role of the facilitator is to create an open and respectful environment in which men and women can feel comfortable sharing and learning from each other in a safe space.

## 7. Tips for Successful Facilitation 3

The following are some useful tips to help you lead the group sessions. These tips, when correctly applied, will help you to encourage and create a respectful environment where men and women will feel comfortable sharing their own opinions and experiences and listening to and learning from others.

## CREATE A SAFE SPACE

It is important that the group meets in a space where participants feel safe and comfortable. The facilitator(s) and the participants should sit in a circle during the discussions to foster dialogue and equality. Part of creating a safe space is ensuring that men and women feel comfortable talking with each other. There are some activities or sessions where it is advised for men and women to participate in separate, smaller groups. This is highlighted in the instructions for relevant activities.

## DECIDE ON AGREEMENTS FOR WORKING TOGETHER

Ask participants to decide on a set of agreements for working together and remind them of those agreements throughout the sessions. Important areas to cover include listening to and showing respect for others (not talking when others are speaking, not making rude comments, and not talking on the phone), having a nonjudgmental attitude, confidentiality (participants shouldn't speak about shared experiences in the group without prior consent), and free and voluntary participation.

## DO NOT JUDGE

Remember, you are here to facilitate discussion and reflection. Your role is not to teach or chastise anyone. Be friendly and create rapport with your participants. Be aware of your own position of power - avoid judgmental and authoritarian attitudes. Never impose your feelings or opinions on the group.

## PROMOTE INCLUSION

Ensure that all participants have an opportunity to speak. Be careful not to let one person dominate the conversation or make other people feel that they cannot share their own opinions. During the sessions with both men and women, take extra care to ensure that the voices of men do not dominate. Encourage women to share their opinions and contribute to sharing experiences.

The group meetings can serve as an important opportunity for participants to receive help and advice. At the beginning of each session, there is a 'check-in' in which men and women can share what is happening in their lives and ask for advice. As a facilitator, it is important that you validate the concerns that people have, but you can also engage the larger group in helping to propose solutions to the problems individuals are facing. Ask the group, 'How do you think this problem could be solved?' or 'Has anyone faced a similar situation? What did you do?'

## MANAGE CONFLICTS RESPECTFULLY

If a conflict arises among the group, or if a participant shares a discriminatory view, remind the participants of the group agreements. Encourage other members to help mediate the situation. Ask the group what they think about the question raised or how they would suggest handling the problem. When necessary, you can offer brief responses to questions and clarify misinformation.

## WELCOME HONESTY AND OPENNESS

Encourage participants to be honest and open. They should not be afraid to discuss sensitive issues for fear of ridicule from their peers. Thank the group members for sharing their personal stories. Never force anyone to participate in the activities. Instead, try to create an environment in which the participants feel comfortable.

## PROMOTE MOVEMENT AND INTERACTION

IInclude as much physical movement as possible so that participants remain active, alert, and interested. You are encouraged to use short energizer activities, such as songs or dances, in between activities in order to keep the participants engaged in the topics you are discussing.

## MANAGE YOUR TIME

Keep track of time; do not spend more than about two hours on the session. Keep in mind participants' attention spans and schedules. Use energizers to help transition between activities and keep participants motivated and alert.

## ASK FOR FEEDBACK

Use the weekly 'check-out' to receive regular feedback from participants: What do they like and dislike? What is working or not working? Use their input to improve the sessions. Do not divert from the planned activities but do use feedback to improve the running of the sessions (for example, by including more energizers).

## CONSIDER USING IMAGES

Some activities suggest the use of illustrations. When these are not included in this manual, the facilitators can create their own images or use drawings or relevant photographs for public use from magazines or the internet.

## 8. Responding to disclosures related to intimate partner violence or mental health

Some problems that participants may be facing, such as mental health issues, substance abuse, or intimate partner violence, may require outside support. In addition, some participants may prefer to discuss a particular concern, obtain information, or seek support outside of a group setting, or they may need attention from a specialized service provider. All Global Communities programs shall establish a referral protocol with the support of a qualified expert and ensure that facilitators are thoroughly trained. As a facilitator, you should be knowledgeable of and always consult the Global Communities referral protocol to ensure you do not put the person at risk and inform your Global Communities supervisor if you are unsure of how to handle a particular problem.

Use the following guidelines to respond to disclosures of violence or other sensitive issues that might require external, specialist services. Please always consult with a Global Communities supervisor and use the specific Global Communities protocol.

During a session, if a participant discloses a painful life experience, you can sit with the participant and ask them if they wish to share their experience. Be sure to avoid pressuring the participant to disclose. Ensure that the group listens with attention and extreme respect.

## If a participant reveals that they have experienced intimate partner violence, it is important to follow these steps:

-  Listen with empathy, validate their experiences and concerns, and be sensitive.
-  Become familiar with resources available locally and have a printed copy available with the names and contact information of centers that offer specialized services for survivors of intimate partner violence. Consult the relevant Global Communities protocol on how to properly refer someone without placing them at risk.
-  If the person is interested in working with specialized services, give them the relevant information and inform your contact at the local center that a participant will be looking for help or information.
-  Show the participant that you care and your concern for their feelings.
-  Do all you can to help the person feel calm, supported, and connected to others.
-  Evaluate if there is a current or ongoing risk of extreme intimate partner violence.
-  Discuss the case with your supervisor.
-  At the end of the session, sit with the person and ask them how they are doing. You can also suggest the group support the person. In the next session, ask how they fared after the session and during the week.
-  If the disclosure of intimate partner violence occurred within the larger group, carefully remind the group of the agreements of respect and confidentiality.

## If the person who discloses intimate partner violence is a woman:

-  Encourage her to remember her agency and strength, and remind her that help is available. Support her in whatever decision she makes, without pressuring her.
-  Inform the woman and others in the group that specialized services exist in the community to help people who live with violent partners. It's important to have up-to-date information on support services. Ask the woman if she is interested in contact information for these services, and if she is, share the relevant information with her, assuring her that it does not contain any revealing information on what types of services these contacts offer. Refer to the relevant Global Communities protocol on how to refer a person while ensuring their safety. Support the integrity of women who live in situations of intimate partner violence.
-  Tell the woman clearly that she is not responsible for the violence suffered at the hands of her partner.

## Actions to avoid when working with a woman who is experiencing intimate partner violence:

-  Attempting to solve her problems
-  Convincing her to leave the violent relationship
-  Convincing her to go to the police or to court
-  Asking detailed questions that force her to relive painful experiences
-  Asking her to analyze what happened and why
-  Pressuring her to reveal her feelings
-  Blaming her for the violence
-  Disrespecting her agency and choice

These actions can do more harm than good 4

## If a man discloses using violence:

-  If a man discloses using violence against his partner, do not allow the group to make light of the issue or make jokes.
-  Remember that in cases of disclosure of violence, it is essential to respect confidentiality. Ensure that all group members are aware that what is shared in the group should not leave the group, as it is critical to guarantee the security of the victims. All disclosures of violence should be discussed with supervisors but never with members of the community. Any followup action should be decided between the facilitators and their supervisor. If the disclosure occurred within the group, ensure that everyone follows the rules of confidentiality and respect.
-  Remember that exemptions to the principle of confidentiality apply only if a participant reveals that they will harm another person or themselves or when someone's bodily integrity or life faces an immediate risk.

4. Adapted from World Health Organization, UN Women, &amp; United Nations Population Fund. (2014). Health care for women subjected to intimate partner violence or sexual violence: A clinical handbook . http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/136101/WHO\_RHR\_14.26\_eng.pdf?sequence=1

## If a participant reveals their intent to harm another person:

1. Speak with your supervisor to determine whom to contact to help the person in danger and connect them to any available resources in the community that can provide support.
2.  Make a connection: Give the person in danger information about organizations where they can receive help. If the individual decides to go, call a contact in the organization and let them know that someone will be seeking support and ask them to receive the person warmly.
3.  Inform your supervisor immediately after the session so they can take the necessary action.

Men's groups should not be considered an appropriate place to share details about violence against women. This could reinforce patriarchal ideas that legitimize violence. In such cases, the focus should be on how to manage anger and violence, on the harm that can be caused, on men taking responsibility for their actions, and on ensuring that potential survivors are not in danger.

## If a participant reports severe mental health issues:

-  If a participant requires specialist support, having disclosed suicidal thoughts or demonstrated severe depression during a session, acknowledge this disclosure in the moment and create a plan to talk individually with the participant. When the session ends, give them information on where they might go to seek support and discuss the case with your supervisor. Remember that facilitators are not the participants' counselors or therapists.

## 9. Carrying Out the Sessions Safely During the Pandemic

Follow the guidelines described in the following chart if during the planning and organizing of sessions with prospective program participants and/or the launch of the group sessions, the country or community is undergoing a lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prioritizing the safety of program team members, participants, and facilitators should lead all implementation decisions to mitigate infection risks through community transmission. As such, all biosecurity protocols established by Global Communities in the context of the pandemic must be applied for fieldwork and the use of vehicles.

<!-- image -->

## 10. Task or Commitment at the End of Each Session

Each session ends with a commitment or follow-up task related to the topic covered in the session. It is important that the facilitator reinforces, together with the participants, the benefits of fulfilling the task. It is also key to motivate participants to carry out the agreed task or commitment and get their feedback in the next session since these activities seek to put into practice those issues reflected on during each session in order to enable changes to occur in family dynamics. As much as possible, it is recommended for the facilitator to give each participant a notebook at the beginning of the process so they can write down their testimonies and experiences when carrying out the tasks. Fulfilling tasks or commitments should not feel forced or mandatory. There is no right or wrong way to perform the activity, and the facilitators should convey that what matters is that each participant makes an effort, whether it's trying out a new behavior or a specific task, and then share with the group how that went for them. As such, positive reinforcement from the implementing team can help a lot. Alternatively, the team may also consider printing a worksheet reflecting the topic and task to be carried out and hand it out for each participant to fill in and be reviewed in the next session.

## Before You Start! Introducing the Journeys of Transformation Dialogue Clubs to WE Members and Their Husbands/Partners

## (Community Information)

Present the Journeys of Transformation Dialogue Clubs at a time when you can meet (most of) the prospective members, such as at the end of a WE session or during a community meeting. Prepare your 'pitch' with trusted friends and/or colleagues so that you feel confident about what you will talk about. Introduce the program by making the following points

## FACILITATOR NOTE

Be sure to also refer to the guidelines and tips outlined in the introduction on how to recruit men and women into the program

<!-- image -->

-  Say that both men and women have expressed a need for a program that works with men, in addition to women, to create happier and healthier homes.
-  Say that the Dialogue Clubs are meant to complement the goals of the WE program by working directly with men and couples.
-  Emphasize that these new Dialogue Clubs aim to:
- Improve household relationships and create family harmony
- Build financial planning skills
- Improve couple communication skills so that families can resolve conflict peacefully
- oShare important information about sexual and reproductive health, such as on contraception
- …And more!
-  Assure the participants that they do not need to know how to read or write to participate in these sessions. This Dialogue Clubs welcome everyone. Activities will involve drawing, role-playing, discussing, and viewing illustrations.
-  Once agreed upon with the participants, share where and at what time the sessions will be held and how often (e.g., once a week, twice a month). Point out that each session will be about two hours long. Say how long the program will be overall (e.g., one month, three months, one year).
-  Describe any other activities that form part of the program, such as 'Family Days' or a graduation ceremony.
-  Ask how they would like the program's content to be tailored to fit their own challenges and realities.

29

30

-  Describe COVID-19 prevention measures being taken to ensure safe social distancing and hygiene protocols (e.g., face masks, hand sanitizer, holding sessions outdoors) and the need to implement these measures.
-  If possible, explain the childcare arrangements and facilities that will be provided (budget allowing) for those who have young children (e.g., paid childcare provider, holding the groups at a time when childcare can be arranged, encouraging parents to bring children to the groups).
-  Explain that participation in the Dialogue Clubs is voluntary - it's important that nobody feels there will be negative consequences if they don't take part, such as compromising their participation in the WE program or other associated benefits.

Be aware of your body language and energy as you present the program. Be enthusiastic and energetic! It will help to generate interest if you are also excited about how the program will positively impact participants' families and communities.

Be sure to have a sign-up sheet where participants can write down primary and secondary phone numbers at which they can be reached and other contact information so you can follow up individually.

-  Closing (15 MINUTES)

## FACILITATOR NOTES

-  This session is designed to create an environment of trust and warmth in order to make participants feel comfortable and connected. Thus, it is key for the facilitator to engage with the participants empathetically and with enthusiasm, recognizing the time they are dedicating to hearing about the program. It is critical to organize childcare - and refreshments, if possible - so that all genders and caregivers can participate.
-  Before you organize the group, get to know the background and occupations of the participants and organize the schedule around the time they have available, selecting a meeting time that is most convenient for all involved. Prior to inviting couples to this session, Global Communities should have discussed this opportunity with participants from the WE groups and have previously obtained their consent to invite their husbands/partners.

ACTIVITY 2.

## Introduction to Journeys of Transformation

- If you are implementing Journeys of Transformation linked to Global Communities' EDUCAMOS program or another program to support education, explain how Global Communities has been working in recent years with the local government and community.  Ask the participants if they know the program and to share what they know about the program. Post the objectives of EDUCAMOS (or other relevant program) on the wall and go over them with the group. 1
- Share that one of the activities from the EDUCAMOS program is forming women's groups called Women Empowered, or WE. Ask the participants what they know about these groups. Clarify any doubts. (The groups are made up of women who are aspiring to a greater quality of life for themselves and their families through developing skills on budgets, savings, leadership development, self-esteem, and decision-making. The women in these groups work collectively to improve the health, nutrition, and education of their community.) 2
- Explain that throughout Global Communities' work with the women in the Women Empowered groups and other projects in the community, many women have expressed their desire for their husbands/partners to participate with them in a program to improve familial relations and for their husbands/partners to support their economic activities. The women have also wanted to create a more harmonious, happy, and healthy home life together with their partners. Additionally: 3
-  Men in focus groups in Cuilco, Guatemala, expressed that they would also want to participate in programs that would help them improve the economic situation and well-being of their family.
-  Both men and women identified central themes they hoped to learn more about and have space to discuss with their partners. The most relevant themes that emerged were:
1. Decision-making and the division of domestic work
2. Management, as a family, of financial resources
3.   Sexual and reproductive health and family planning
- The men noted there are various spaces for women to develop their skills, create community, and share experiences, but there were fewer opportunities for men to do the same. They expressed their desire to create similar spaces for men to meet in order to analyze the challenges they face in improving their households' social and economic situation.
- Global Communities responded to these demands by creating a special program called Journeys of Transformation . It is designed to involve men - alongside their wives/partners, who are currently participating in Women Empowered - in promoting healthy lifestyles, economic development, and household well-being. T he Journeys of Transformation program focuses on strengthening communication skills to improve healthy relationships, mutual support, and the quality of family life.
- Explain that all men have a very important role to play in improving the emotional well-being, health, and economic well-being of their families. This program consists of a series of Dialogue Clubs (or group sessions) for couples. Tell the participants: 4

<!-- image -->

'In the Dialogue Clubs, we will work together to address some of the problems that we face in our homes and communities. We are also going to analyze how men and women can work together as partners with mutual respect and support to create a successful and prosperous home.'

- Explain that the objective of the Dialogue Clubs is to complement the work of the Women Empowered program, working directly with the women's partners/husbands. You can share the following in reference to what many people in their community have expressed: 5
-  'Many men in this community want to secure well-being and success for their families. They want to meet the economic, social, and health needs of their families. In this group, men will have the opportunity to speak to other men, learn from each other, and learn how to improve their economic situation at home. Men and women will also learn how to work together in order to create a healthier, more balanced, and more productive home environment, in which the needs of all family members - men and women, girls and boys - are acknowledged.'
-  You can also mention that some men in the community support women in their personal and economic empowerment and this has positively impacted the quality of life of these women and their families. If you know of examples or have video testimonies, you can share them with the participants.
- The Dialogue Clubs have several objectives. If possible, tape up the images that represent each program objective and ask the participants to discuss these images in relation to each objective before sharing the objective itself with them. The objectives are: 6
- Improve relations in the home and contribute to family harmony
- Develop planning skills for household finances and support both women and men in making financial decisions to secure the well-being of their sons and daughters
- Promote men's support to income-generating projects for women
- Improve couples' communication skills to resolve family conflicts peacefully
- Share important information about sexual and reproductive health, including on family planning
- Tell participants that raising a family is complicated and challenging and that sharing experiences and getting support from others who have similar problems helps us confront challenges together. Participation in the Dialogue Clubs will help parents learn how to help their children grow in a safe and healthy way, how to face challenges in raising children, and how to communicate effectively with their sons and daughters. Furthermore, participants will work on dealing with difficult emotions like anger and frustration and on nonviolent ways of resolving conflict within the family. 7
- Explain that they will now do an activity together to provide an example of how the group will work together during the sessions. 8

<!-- image -->

## ACTIVITY 3.

## Icebreaker Activity: My Family Vision

<!-- image -->

## PURPOSE

Reflect on goals that men and women have for their family and think about how the Dialogue Clubs can contribute to realizing these goals; create a vision of the family that guides and supports the realization of personal goals

<!-- image -->

- Explain that the Dialogue Clubs are designed to help men and women work together to realize their dreams and goals. They will be doing an activity now to better understand the group. 1
- Clarify that they are going to reflect on the objectives they would like to achieve in the long term for the well-being of their family and on how the groups sessions and the program can help them achieve these goals. 2
- Ask the participants to close their eyes and think about the following: 3

?

## 'IMAGINE THAT WE MEET AGAIN IN FIVE YEARS.'

'What do you hope to have accomplished by then?'

'What do you hope for yourselves? What do you hope for your partner? If you have children, what do you wish for your children? What do you hope for other family members or important people in your life?'

'How are your relationships with your partner and with your sons and daughters, if you have any? How do you feel about them? How do you feel about yourself? What would you like that to look like in the future?'

- 'In what ways do you, your family members, and other significant people in your life take care of each other? How do you help each other? What would you like that to look like in the future?'
- Ask the participants to keep their eyes closed and think about their vision for the future and what it looks like. Ask them how they feel about the scene they are picturing and to identify in which part of their body they feel that emotion (e.g., joy, fulfillment, satisfaction). 4
- Next, tell the participants to think of one or two objectives or long-term goals that they want their families to achieve. 5

<!-- image -->

- After a few minutes, ask for volunteers to share their plans with the group. 6
- Allow sufficient time for any participants who wish to do so to share their vision of the future. Clarify that sharing is entirely voluntary. 7
- After everyone who wishes to share has done so, begin a discussion using the group reflection questions. 8
- Invite the participants to join the Dialogue Clubs with other couples in the community. Mention that the groups will meet every two weeks for 13 sessions of peer-to-peer learning and exchange that will begin on [DATE]. Some sessions will be for men and women separately, and others will be carried out together. 9
- If applicable, mention logistical aspects that should be taken into consideration, according to the particular needs of the community (such as days and times of the meetings, childcare, and organizing transportation). Ask participants, again, if they have any preferences. 10

Invite the participants to ask any questions they have.

-  These questions can be used as a guide, but you do not have to ask all of them. Select the ones that you feel are most relevant for your context.

What similarities do you notice among the different family visions? What differences are there?

What is needed for each member of your family to achieve this family vision?

If only one person is in charge of important family decisions, how does this affect the family vision?

How can women's participation in income-generating activities help that vision?

-  We can achieve our goals when every member of our families feels valued, respected, and content and when men and women live equally, work together peacefully, and work effectively to use the available resources for the good of the whole family.
-  In this group, we will work together to begin achieving these goals.
-  Learning how to work together in a team, as a couple, is important and will help you to manage your income effectively and decide more wisely how to invest it.

## FACILITATOR NOTES

ADAPTATION NOTES FOR WE GROUPS

-  Note that the women's session may be shorter and delivered as part of a regular WE group meeting. As the women know each other already, you do not need to do Activity #1 with the women's group. However, even if the women have their group agreement already, you can do Activity #2 to brainstorm how to keep the space safe and confidential for the rest of the meetings, as these sessions may discuss more sensitive topics.
-  Arrange enough chairs for all the participants to sit in a circle. This should be done for all of the sessions! If chairs are not available, pick an area where participants can comfortably sit down in a circle.
-  Prepare a flipchart paper listing the titles of all 13 sessions of the Dialogue Club.
-  Remember that it is important for the group to co-create and mutually decide upon a set of shared agreements during this session. As the facilitator, your role is to ensure safety, confidentiality, and sensitivity in the group. Use the first session to help enforce the agreements and demonstrate the principles of a respectful group environment.
-  Given that women in WE have already been meeting for several weeks, it may not be necessary to reintroduce group members to one another. Instead, use the information in the 'Welcome and Introductions' activity to remind the participants what the new sessions will be about.
-  For the weekly commitment, encourage the women to share their family visions with their husbands/partners at home.

## PURPOSE

Introduce Dialogue Club participants to one another; explain the purpose of the Dialogue Club meetings

<!-- image -->

Attendance sheet, refreshments, flipchart paper with 13 sessions written on it, blank flipchart paper, markers

- Greet participants warmly as they arrive, and introduce yourself if there are members you have not met before. Thank them for coming and ask them for their names, if applicable. If possible, offer them water or another refreshment. 1
- Let participants mingle informally, following physical distancing measures, 5 before officially starting the first session. 2
- Once everyone has arrived for the meeting, pass around the attendance sheet, on which they can fill in their current contact information. Support them, if they cannot read or write or if they find writing difficult. Keep in mind an alternative plan if this occurs. The attendance sheet should be updated as necessary throughout the process in order to maintain contact and monitor participants' attendance. 3
- As they fill in the attendance sheet, introduce the purpose of the Dialogue Clubs: 'Welcome to the Dialogue Club, and thank you for coming! We are very happy that you accepted our invitation to participate in this group meeting. You were invited to this group because your wife or partner is participating in the Women Empowered program.' 4
- Ask, 'Who can tell me about Women Empowered?' After receiving a few responses, explain that the program aims to: 5
-  Support women in forming community-based savings groups that help members save money, access credit, develop financial skills, and invest in incomegenerating activities
-  Strengthen women's skills, increase their self-esteem, provide access to information and resources, and provide a support network that can help them to become confident decision-makers and leaders in their homes and communities
- Explain that men also have an important role to play in improving the family's emotional and economic well-being. Say: 'In the Dialogue Club, we are going to work together to address some of the problems that we face in our homes and communities. We are also going to discuss how men and women can work together, as supportive and respectful partners, to promote a more successful and prosperous household.' 6
- Set the tone for the group. Show that the space is safe by sharing a personal story about why the Dialogue Clubs are important for men like you. 7

## EXAMPLE PERSONAL STORY

For me, the Dialogue Clubs are important because I found that I was not well-prepared for what it means to live and communicate well in a relationship. Instead of communicating in an open and honest way, I tended to turn silent. Sometimes, I became resentful because my wife had a closer relationship with the children and I was more on the sidelines. She was even earning money, even though I believed it was my main role as a man to be the breadwinner. It sometimes made me feel empty and sad. Because of this, I sometimes worked even harder at my job to try to fill that emptiness with work - and this meant I spent less time with my family.

When I met with other men in a safe space where we could talk about what really matters to us, I realized that I am not alone. There are many other men who want to make a change, and we can start by reflecting and sharing our challenges and dreams with each other. This is important to me. This makes me happy.

- Next, pair up participants and explain that they will introduce their partner to the group. They should ask the following information from their partner: 8
-  Their name
-  Their partner or spouse's name
-   Their favorite activity to carry out as a family
-  What they would like to do more of as a family
- After five minutes, ask participants to introduce their partner. Thank everyone for sharing. Tell the group: 'This group will meet every two weeks for the next 13 weeks [or for six months if the meetings are held 9 10

every two weeks]. Each session will be around two hours and will have a different topic.'

- Do a quick energizer with the group before showing the flipchart paper with all 13 session topics written on it. Give a general explanation of the sessions: 'In these sessions, you will have the opportunity to discuss, to share your personal experiences, and to learn from each other. These sessions will help you to engage in positive personal development, including more collaborative, healthy, and nonviolent relations at home and in the community. You will also learn about important topics, such as how to create a household budget and how to have better relationships with your spouse or partner and your daughters and sons.' 11
- Ask if there is anything else that they would like to learn in the Dialogue Clubs about how to nourish happier, healthier families. Add the suggestions to the flipchart paper. 12
- Review the list of suggestions on the flipchart paper. If there is anything that you know to be clearly outside of the scope of the project (e.g., how to start a small business), explain this will not be the focus of the sessions in order to keep expectations realistic. In any case, let them know that you will share their feedback with your supervisor and report back to them at the next session on how the program will include these suggestions. 13

FACILITATOR NOTE

-  With your supervisor, discuss if it is possible to integrate some of these topics/suggestions into your existing sessions. As much as you can, aim to be flexible because the groups should be useful to your participants' lives.

ex.

- Explain that many of these sessions are designed for men and women to participate together. During some meetings, men and women will participate in separate discussions or activities. Say that it is important for both groups to reflect on their experiences and to have time to share ideas with other men or with other women. This can help us to learn and to grow as individuals. One session is for men only. This session is to help men to discuss and learn about topics that are relevant to their experiences as men and as husbands/partners and fathers. 14
- Reassure the participants that they do not need to know how to read or write to participate in these sessions. This group welcomes everyone. Activities will involve drawing, role-playing, discussing, and viewing illustrations. 15
- Next, tell the group that your role as the facilitator is to support the change process in order to encourage everyone to talk and share and to guarantee that everyone feels safe within the group. To ensure this group is a place where everyone feels comfortable, it is important to establish a group agreement. 16

Create a safe space where everyone feels respected and free to share their thoughts and opinions; appoint two or three representatives to be liaisons between the participants of the group and the facilitator

<!-- image -->

Flipchart paper and markers

- Explain to the group that in this activity, they will create and agree upon a set of shared group agreements to keep the space safe and confidential for the rest of the meetings. 1
- Ask the group: 'What rules or agreements would help you to feel safe and comfortable to discuss and share in the Dialogue Club?' 2
- Ask the group members to contribute ideas for agreements or rules they would like the group to adopt for them to feel comfortable and to trust the other group members. 3
- Explain to participants that it is necessary to have two or three people who can convey important program information to each participant; the appointment will be made in a democratic and voluntary manner to achieve the respect and collaboration of all participants. 4

## FACILITATOR NOTE

-  You should write down the list of agreements that participants suggest on a flipchart paper. If literacy is low, you can write them on a regular piece of paper and then read them out to the group. The following box has a list of several recommended agreements and rules that you can share with the group to help guide the discussion if these are not mentioned. If these rules are not mentioned first by the group members, you may suggest them by saying these agreements have helped other groups feel safe and have productive sessions.

## I MPORTANT GROUP AGREEMENTS FOR A SUCCESSFUL GROUP

## PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

-  The privacy of personal experiences must be guaranteed. No one should discuss the private information shared in the group with others in the community if someone does not want it to be shared. All personal stories and experiences that are shared in the group will remain in the group.

<!-- image -->

-  However, participants are encouraged to share any general knowledge or lessons they have learned in the sessions with others outside of this group, such as friends, family members, and neighbors.

## EQUALITY AND RESPONSIBILITY

-  All members of the group are equal, irrespective of age, sex, or background. All members have a voice and the right to speak, share, and contribute.
-  All members are responsible for their own actions and behavior. Every member takes responsibility for what he or she does.

## RESPECT AND EMPATHY

-  Everyone should speak one at a time and allow each person the time to speak. Everyone's viewpoint is important, so we need to make sure everyone is heard. Listen and show interest in what others have to say.
-  Everyone must practice empathy: Imagine yourself in the other person's shoes and try to understand how they feel. Respect the opinions of others and try not to judge others for their experiences or opinions.
-  Every member should actively participate and contribute to the group. Use only 'I believe, ' 'I think, ' or 'I have experienced' statements. Do not assume that your viewpoint is shared with everyone else in the group.

## COMMITMENT

-  We are here because we value the opportunity to learn from each other. If you join the group, commit to attending every session. We all have multiple responsibilities, and at times, might not be able to participate. Please let the facilitator know prior to the meeting if you won't be able to attend.
- After a list of recommended rules is created, ask, 'Is there anything missing that you would like to add?' Consider adding a list of biosafety guidelines to organize meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic (look at recommendations for safe meetings in the manual introduction). 5
- Make any additions that are suggested. After the list is complete, ask each group member if they can agree to the list of ground rules and to verbally commit to the rules: 'Does everyone agree to this list and commit to upholding these agreements during our sessions?' 6

FACILITATOR NOTE

-  If someone does not want to commit to the group agreement, ask him or her why. Allow the group to discuss any concerns that participants have about a particular ground rule. Suggest that the rule be changed or removed, depending on the desires of the group. Ask the group: 'Are there alternative rules that you would feel more comfortable with?'

- Tell the group that each member has a role to play in upholding the group agreement. If someone is not respecting the agreement, the group members and the facilitator should remind the person of the agreements to which they have committed. These should be polite reminders, not reprimands. 7
- Tell participants that they should appoint two or three people to serve as liaisons, supporting and facilitating communication between group members and the facilitator when necessary. Recommend they select participants who are dynamic, responsible, and proactive and have good communication skills. After these people have been chosen, write their names and phone numbers on a flipchart paper so that everyone has this information. Thank the participants who were chosen and highlight the importance of respecting and paying attention to the information they can each share with all members of the group. 8

## FACILITATOR NOTE

-  It is important that the agreements are visible in all sessions to help all group members to internalize and respect them. Use different activities to remind the participants of the different group agreements and encourage the participants to do so as well.

## ACTIVITY 3.

## My Family Vision

<!-- image -->

## PURPOSE

Reflect on men and women's goals for their family and discuss how the group sessions and the program can contribute to achieving their longterm family vision; create a family vision that will guide them and their personal goals throughout the program

<!-- image -->

NOTE

Find a way to make the family visions developed by couples available for future sessions in which they will be required. Please note that participants may misplace their drawings. Consider taking a picture of each one and then printing them all.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Paper, pens, or pencils; megaphone or sound system

- Tell the group that the Dialogue Clubs are designed to help men and women work together to achieve their dreams. 1
- Explain: 'We are going to reflect on what goals we would like to achieve in the long term for the well-being of our families, as well as how the group sessions and the program can contribute to achieving them. Some of you may have done this activity during the information session; we will do it again, as it is important for the rest of the program. Your responses may be the same or different than last time.' 2
- Ask the participants to close their eyes and think about the following (you can use the sound system or speaker to play soothing music to set the mood and help participants relax, feel comfortable, and focus on exercise): 3

?

## 'IMAGINE THAT WE MEET AGAIN IN FIVE YEARS.'

'What are the things you hope to have achieved in that time?'

'What do you hope for yourselves? For your partner? If you have children, what do you wish for your children? What do you wish for other family members or important people in your life?'

'In your vision of the future, how are your relationships with your partner and your sons and daughters, if you have any? How do you feel about them? How do you feel about yourself?'

'In what ways do you, your family members, and other significant people in your life take care of each other? How do you help each other? How do you speak to and listen to each other?'

- Ask the participants to keep their eyes closed and think about this vision for the future and what it looks like. You can also ask them how they feel in this scenario they are envisioning and to identify where in their body they feel that emotion (e.g., joy, fulfillment, contentment). 4
- Next, tell the participants to think of two or three long-term goals they want their family to achieve. 5
- Next, pass out colored markers or pencils and a piece of paper to each participant and ask them to draw or write their vision for their family's future. 6
- After a few minutes, ask if someone would like to volunteer to share his or her family vision with the group. 7
- Allow enough time for participants (those who feel comfortable) to share their family visions. Sharing is not required and is voluntary. 8
- After everyone who wants to has shared his or her vision for the family's future, start a discussion using the group discussion questions. 9

## FACILITATOR NOTE

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS ?

## KEY MESSAGES

-  These questions are meant as a guide; you don´t need to ask all of them. Use the ones you feel will be most relevant for the exercise.

What are some of the similarities you noticed among the different family visions? Differences?

Who from your family needs to be involved for these visions to be achieved?

What does it take for each family member to achieve these family visions?

If only one person from the family is in charge of making important decisions, how does this affect the family vision? ?

How can women's participation in Women Empowered groups contribute to this vision?

-  We can achieve our family vision when each family member feels valued, respected, and happy and when men and women live together peacefully and work effectively to use the available resources for the good of the whole family.
-  In this group, we will work together to begin to realize how to achieve these visions.
-  Learning how to effectively work together as a couple is very important and will help you to manage your earned income more effectively and decide more wisely how to invest it.

IMPORTANT: Ask participants to keep their family visions, as they will be further discussed in a later session. Take photos of the family visions for printing later. 10

## ACTIVITY 4. Check-Out and Weekly Commitment

- Explain that the session is ending, and thank everyone for their participation. 1
- Ask the group: 2
-  'Do you have any questions about the session?'
-  'Did you learn something today that will be useful in your own life? If so, what is it?'
- After finishing the questions, share the weekly commitment and confirm the time, date, and place of the next session. 3

## WEEKLY COMMITMENT

Explain  that  at  the  end  of  each  session,  group  members  will  be  given  an  assignment  or  task to  perform  when  they  go  home,  called  the  'weekly  commitment. '  They  should  come  to  the next session prepared to share their experience of doing the weekly commitment (if they feel comfortable). The weekly commitment assignment is meant to help participants put into practice some of the ideas or knowledge they have learned in the group.

This session's weekly commitment assignment is to go home and share their family vision with their spouse. Ask them to hear their partner/spouse's vision and listen to what he or she has to say. At this early stage in the program, it is not important to come to an agreement about whose vision is better but rather to listen to the other person's hopes and goals for the family. In a later session, couples will have the opportunity to discuss ways to create one shared family vision.

## FACILITATOR NOTES

## KEY CONCEPTS

## BIOLOGICAL SEX

Biological sex refers to the physical characteristics you are born with. It includes a person's anatomy and physical attributes (e.g., external sex organs, sex chromosomes, and internal reproductive structures). When these classifications don't line up with what is typically considered a male or female body, the individual is usually referred to as intersex.

-  Review the session and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
-  Prepare three sheets of paper, one with a        (happy face) drawn on it, one with a (sad face) drawn on it, and one with a          (neutral face) drawn on it. Hang the sheets on different sides of the room.
-  If you are short on time, only do the Man Box and Woman Box and then go to the group discussion and key messages.

## GENDER

Gender refers to the way society defines the roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes of men, women, boys, and girls, including people who are transgender. These definitions are not fixed but change over time and are different from society to society. We learn the behavior expected of our gender by interacting with the world around us. Sometimes, these ideas of how to be men and women are thought to be based on our biology rather than something that we learn (e.g., the common myth that violence is a part of men's biology).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Thank all of the participants for coming to the session. 1
- Do an energizer (from the section at the end of the manual or from the Icebreakers Guide) before you formally start the session. 2
- Explain that at the beginning of each session, there will be a 'check-in, ' in which participants will have an opportunity to share how they are and any feedback they have since the last meeting. 3
- Lead a check-in by asking a few volunteers from the group: 4
-  'How are you?'
-  'Has anything new happened since the last session?'
-  After reminding participants of the key messages from Session 1 (listed at the end of the session), 'Did you talk to anyone about what we discussed in the group? If so, what did you share?'
- Explain to the group that this is also the time for them to give feedback on their weekly commitment assignment. Ask the group: 5
-  'How did it go?'
-  'How did you feel after doing the assignment?'
-  'What was the result of the assignment?'
- Share personal insights from the last session that you had as a facilitator, such as anything that you learned or that surprised you from what was discussed. 6
- Tell the group the core purpose of today's session (included in this session's introduction). Say that if they do not understand the word 'gender,' not to worry! They will learn about it in today's session. 7

## ACTIVITY 1.

## Values Clarification 6

<!-- image -->

## PURPOSE

Listen to, discuss, and reflect on how people view men's and women's gender roles in society

<!-- image -->

- Explain to the group that you will read aloud a few sentences one by one. After each sentence is read, participants should walk to and stand near the face that best represents what they think. If they agree with the sentence, they should walk to the side with the happy face. If they disagree, they should walk to the sad face. If they're unsure, they can walk to the neutral face. 1
- To begin, ask everyone to stand in the middle of the room. 2
- Read out any one of the following statements. Repeat it to make sure everyone has understood. 3

## VALUES CLARIFICATION STATEMENTS

'A man should feel ashamed if he cannot earn enough money to support his family.'

'Men are better leaders than women.'

'Women are naturally/biologically better at taking caring of children.'

'Real men do not cry.'

- 'Women are solely responsible for planning the number of children they will have.'

'At home, it is the man who has the last word.'

'A woman should always support her husband's or partner's decisions.'

- Ask people to think about the sentence and then walk to the side that best represents their answer. 4
- Once everyone has chosen a side, give them a few minutes to share their viewpoints with the group regarding why they agree, disagree, or are unsure. 5

6. This version of 'Values Clarification' - a well-known activity - was adapted from Concern Worldwide, Promundo-US, &amp; Rede Homens pela Mudança. (2016).

|   6 | Donotrespond to their statements with your ownopinions. Just listen. However, do look for patterns in the responses. For example, do younger mentendto answer one way and oldermen another? Share these observations with the group and ask them whythey thinksomemenmight have different opinions than other men. Encourage participants to pose questions to thosewho have opposing views.                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   7 | After each group (those whoagree, disagree, and are unsure) has had a chance to explain their responses, ask if anyone would like to change their answer. If anyone decides to change place, ask what led them to change their mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   8 | After a few minutes, ask participants to comeback to the center of the circle. Read the next statement. Repeat the exercise. Depending on time, you maybeable to read one or two more statements before time is up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|   9 | Whentimeis up, ask participants to sit back downin a circle so you can share the key closing messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  10 | Ask, 'Howdid you feel as you did this activity?' Get as manyresponses as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  11 | Close the activity by saying: 'What we discussed and debated today was menandwomen's gender roles, society's beliefs about what it means to be a manandwoman.It is good to discuss and debate men's and women's roles in society. This helps us to gain new understanding of the ways in which some beliefs aboutmenandwomencan harm the well-being of the family. Other beliefs can be beneficial, and we maywant to pass them on to our own children and family members. Wewill explore this concept of gender more deeply in the next activity!' |

## ACTIVITY 2.

## The Man, Woman, and Human Boxes 7

## PURPOSE

Explore how gender roles are created and discuss their community's beliefs and expectations on how to be a man and a woman; explore ways to challenge harmful gender norms in order to improve family well-being.

<!-- image -->

Flipchart paper, markers, 'Man, Woman, and Human Boxes' illustrations, tape

- Divide the participants into two groups. Assign one group to be 'Men' and the other group to be 'Women.' (they don't need to join the group based on their gender, they can be mixed groups or separated by gender) 1
- Give each group a flipchart paper, a marker, and the following instructions. 2
- Give them 20 minutes to complete the activity. 3
- Facilitate a group reflection with the group discussion questions (provided after the instructions). 4

<!-- image -->

## I NSTRUCTIONS FOR THE 'MEN' GROUP

-  Show the group the 'Man in the Box' illustration.
-  Ask the group to brainstorm a list of what society expects from this man when they tell him, 'Act like a man!' Examples include, 'Be strong, 'Act tough,' and 'Don't cry.'
-  Tell them to draw a big square on their flipchart paper.
-  Tell them to either write out the words or draw images that represent 'acting like a man' INSIDE this square or box on their flipchart paper.
-  Show the group the illustration of the 'Man and Woman Outside the Box.' Ask the group, 'Why is this man considered 'outside the box'?' Tell the group to write or draw any characteristics that society labels 'not acting like a man' on the flipchart paper OUTSIDE the box. Examples include caring for babies, washing clothes, and crying.
-  When the group has filled the area inside and outside their boxes, ask the participants to take two or three extra minutes to circle the items on the flipchart paper that directly relate to men's roles as fathers.

-  Ask the group to brainstorm a list of what society expects from this woman when they tell her, 'Act like a woman!' Examples include, 'Clean the house' and 'Take care of the children. '
-  Tell them to draw a big square on their flipchart paper.
-  Tell them to either write out these words or draw images of these words INSIDE this square or box on their flipchart paper.
-  Show the group the illustration of the 'Man and Woman Outside the Box.' Ask the group, 'Why are these women are considered 'outside the box'?' Tell the group to write or draw any characteristics that society labels 'not acting like a woman' on the flipchart paper OUTSIDE the box. Examples include working outside the home and playing football.
-  When the group has filled the area inside and outside their box, ask the participants to take two or three extra minutes and circle the items on the flipchart paper that directly relate to women's roles as mothers.

## FACILITATOR NOTE

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

<!-- image -->

## FOR EXAMPLE

## FOR EXAMPLE

## FOR EXAMPLE

-  These are some examples of expected gender roles that came out during the formative research in Huehuetenango, Guatemala.

<!-- image -->

## THE MAN BOX ( example )

-  Sole authority within and outside of the home
-  Does not contribute inside the home with domestic work or childcare
-  Uses violence and force to maintain authority
-  Controls 'his woman'
-  Head of the household (mandate from religion)
-  Has more privileges
-  Powerful
-  Where do these messages come from? Who is the messenger? Do the messages differ if they come from a man or a woman (e.g., mother, father, religious leader, boss, sibling, friends)?
-  What are the differences between the two boxes? Are they opposites? How so?
-  What are the advantages for men who stay in the Man Box and for women who stay in the Woman Box?

ex.

-  Men who stay in the Man Box may be well-respected by other men. Women who stay in the Woman Box may find it easier socially if they get married.
-  What are the disadvantages to staying in the Man Box or Woman Box?

ex.

-  Men may feel constant pressure to provide or feel depressed that they cannot comply with all aspects of the Man Box. Women may be unable to get work outside the home even though they would like to.
-  Are there any advantages of stepping out of the box? What are they?

ex.

-  They may be on track to achieve the family vision, have more open communication between partners, and/or have more peaceful households because each person is part of the decisionmaking process.
-  In what way are the Dialogue Clubs and Women Empowered encouraging us to step outside of our boxes?

## ACTIVITY 2.

## THE MAN, WOMAN, AND HUMAN BOXES CONTINUED

<!-- image -->

- Show participants the illustration 'Man Stepping Outside the Box.' Ask what they see when this man steps outside the box. Get as many responses as possible. Say there are many 5

<!-- image -->

## THE WOMAN BOX ( Example )

-  Educates children
-  Cooks
-  Cleans
-  Helps her spouse on the farm
-  Obeys her husband
-  Takes care of the animals

benefits when men and women are not restricted by society's rules or expectations about gender.

- Make another box on a new piece of flipchart paper. This should be done with all of the participants. Label this box the 'Human Box.' 6
- Explain that there are many positive characteristics inside the Man Box. In fact, much of the 'empowerment' work done with women, such as in Women Empowered, is to create the conditions that give them the skills, voice, and agency over the decisions that affect their lives capabilities that are traditionally seen as 'masculine' in patriarchal societies. 7
- Ask the participants to point out the positive qualities of the Man Box. Write or draw them inside the box labeled 'Human Box.' 8
- Explain that there are also many positive characteristics inside the Woman Box. Examples might include spending time with children, expressing emotions, being affectionate and loving, and playing an active role in domestic work. 9
- Ask the participants to point out the positive qualities in the Woman Box. Write or draw them inside the box labeled 'Human Box. ' 10
- Remind the participants of the items circled that they felt directly related to the roles that fathers and mothers have. Point out how many of these items are now in the 'Human Box. ' 11

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

<!-- image -->

-  Gender is society's beliefs and expectations on how men and women are expected to behave. Some of these beliefs can drive people to act and behave in ways that cause harm to men and women and to those they care about.
-  A person can be any combination of characteristics inside the Human Box. It doesn't matter if you're a man or woman. Such decisions should be based on their personal choices as individuals and human beings, not forced upon them because of what society expects.
-  When we aspire to the ideals of the Human Box, we are changing the question from 'How should a man/woman act?' to 'How would a human being act?'
-  This can promote peace and respect in the family.
-  This can help us to achieve our family visions.

<!-- image -->

## ACTIVITY 3.

## Check-Out and Weekly Commitment

- Explain that the session is ending, and thank everyone for their participation. 1
- Ask the group: 2
-  'Do you have any questions about the session?'
-  'Did you learn something today that will be useful in your own life? If so, what is it?'
- After finishing the questions, share the weekly commitment and confirm the time, date, and place of the next session. 3

## WEEKLY COMMITMENT

The weekly commitment is for each participant to think about who they are and who they want to be outside of their Man or Woman Box. Show the following illustration, 'Thinking About My Identity Beyond Gender Roles.' Give participants a copy of the illustration and encourage them to think about the questions and write or draw their responses.

-  Remind the participants that although being outside of the box will lead to some of the positive things we discussed, it is not going to happen all at once. Change takes time. Staying in the box can be harmful, and we should continue to think of ways to break out of this box to be truer to ourselves. ALSO NOTE
-  Thank everyone for coming. Remind everyone about the time and day for the next session.

## FACILITATOR NOTES

## ADAPTATION NOTES FOR WE GROUPS

## MORE BACKGROUND I NFORMATION FOR THIS SESSION

-  During the session, some participants may express that men need to have power over women. Invite others who disagree to share what they think. If needed, emphasize the importance of working together to achieve a world in which power is shared and can be used in positive ways within families and between partners.
-  Review the activity and be sure you understand the content, teaching methodology, and timing.
-  Put all character cards in a box, bag, or hat for participants to select. Though the activity is brief, taking on the role of some of these characters can be an emotional experience, especially for those characters who experience the most oppression. Be aware of how people react emotionally to the activity.
-  After the 'Patriarchy and the Power Walk' activity, encourage discussion among female group members about what they would do if they had more power to make decisions. What would they do differently from, and the same as, men who currently have this power?

Read through these concepts in preparation for Session 3's topic, power:

Some types of power exist in relation to other people or resources. We have (or do not have) power in relation to another person or group that has more, less, or the same power we do. It is a relationship. For example, this includes a teacher and student or a parent and child.

Power is not fixed. It is not something we are biologically born with (that is, it is not inherent to us but is constructed based on circumstance, community, and context), nor is it something that we always have all the time. We are constantly moving in and out of situations and relationships in which we have more or less power - for example, a woman who is a supervisor at work has power over her employees, but she may not have the same level of power at home with her husband..

Power can lead to positive and negative feelings. We often feel positive and in control when we are feeling powerful, and we have negative feelings when we are feeling less powerful. This affects our ability to influence and take action in a situation.

There are different types of power, which can be used in different ways. These are:

## POWER OVER

To have control over someone or a situation in a negative way, usually associated with repression, force, corruption, discrimination, and abuse. This involves 'taking power' from someone else and then using it to dominate and prevent others from taking it - a win-lose situation.

## POWER WITH

To have power on the basis of collective strength and/or numbers - to have power with people or groups, to find common ground among different interests, and to build a common goal to benefit all those in the collective. This power multiplies individual talents and knowledge and is based on support, solidarity, and collaboration.

## POWER TO

The ability to shape and influence one's life. It refers to having the ideas, knowledge, skills, money, and ability to convince yourself and others to do something. When many people have this kind of power, it can also create 'power with.'

## POWER WITHIN

A person's feelings of self-worth and self-knowledge. This is related to people's ability to imagine a better life for themselves and to have hope and the sense that they can change the world - the feeling that they have rights as human beings. It involves having a sense of self-confidence and a feeling that they have value because they exist.

## PURPOSE

Increase participants' awareness of power and the different forms it takes, reflecting on one's own experiences of feeling powerless and powerful

<!-- image -->

- Say that to start the activity, the group will use an icebreaker called 'The Mirror. ' Tell participants to form pairs and stand in front of each other. Demonstrate and explain how the game is played before beginning: One person should place their hand in front of their partner and make movements with their hand that the other person should follow as best they can. The movements can be as varied as the first person likes. After about three minutes, ask the pairs to change roles. The second person then must place their hand in front of their partner, who must follow its movements. At the end, invite participants to reflect first on how they felt following the other person's hand movements even if they didn't want to. Second, ask how they felt making the other person carry out movements that they wanted the other person to do. 1
- Explain to the group that in this activity, they are going to explore what power is and how it impacts the lives of men and women. 2
- Ask the group: 'What does 'power' mean to you?' Allow the participants to exchange their ideas and opinions 3
- Next, ask the participants to close their eyes and remember a time they felt powerless. After a minute, ask the participants (still with their eyes closed) to remember a time they felt powerful. 4
- After a minute, tell the participants to open their eyes. Tell the group that participants will now have an opportunity to share some of their experiences. This is an opportune moment to remind the participants of the ground rules, particularly of confidentiality and empathy, but also of the importance of participation. 5

## FACILITATOR NOTE

-  To encourage the group, you may want to start sharing first. A common example of moving in and out of power can do with migrating from one's own country (where a man can feel powerful in his own home) to another country (where he feels powerless and alone, especially if he is an undocumented migrant).

- Ask the group: 'How does it feel to be powerful?' Allow the participants to share how being powerful feels. Ask if anyone would like to share their experience with the group or explain what situations make us feel powerful. Sharing is voluntary, not compulsory. 6
- Next, ask the group: 'How does it feel to be powerless?' Allow the participants to share how being powerless feels. Ask if anyone would like to share their experience with the group or explain what situations make us feel powerless. 7

## FACILITATOR NOTE

<!-- image -->

The following information can help explain feelings of being powerful or powerless.

## FEELING POWERFUL CAN FEEL LIKE BEING:

-  In control
-  Knowledgeable
-  Brave
-  Big
-  Strong
-  Happy

## FEELING POWERLESS CAN FEEL LIKE BEING

-  Small
-  Without any control
-  Unwanted
-  Fearful
-  Not confident
-  Sad
- After the group has shared different examples, explain that power can be positive or negative depending on a person's own experience. 8

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

## FACILITATOR NOTE

Next, start a group discussion using the group discussion questions.

<!-- image -->

We mostly talked about the types of power you can have over someone else. Can you think of positive forms of power?

-  Here, you can provide examples such as having the internal power to achieve something and collective power as a group to make change.

Who normally has power in society? Who normally does not have power? Why don't we see more women in positions of power?

Is there a difference in how men use power and how women use power?

How is power used to control things like money, land, and other resources?

What would the benefits be of sharing power in the home? What would be the benefits of sharing power at the community level (e.g., women in leadership positions)?

How can sharing power help us to achieve our family visions?

## KEY MESSAGES

-  Power has many different faces and meanings. In and of itself, power is neutral. Power exists in relationship to other people.
-  We do not always have power and are constantly moving in and out of situations and relationships in which we have more or less power.
-  Sometimes, we use this power in ways that are harmful to those around us, or others use their power over us. However, each of us has the ability to use power in positive ways.

<!-- image -->

## ACTIVITY 2.

## Patriarchy and the Power Walk 8

## PURPOSE

Explore how the power each of us has is based upon the different aspects of our identity, not only gender; discuss how one's power can be used in a positive way; brainstorm what can be done to promote the sharing of power at home and in the communityd.

<!-- image -->

Character cards (in the appendix of this session)

- Say the participants have explored how it feels to be powerful and powerless. Now, they will explore how a person's identity impacts how much power they have in society. 1
- Invite five to seven volunteers (depending on the size of the group) to help out with the activity. Invite them to get up and form a line, standing shoulder to shoulder (or further apart depending on COVID-19 restrictions!) in an open space that enables them to move up and down the room. 2
- Distribute character cards to the volunteers. (Choose characters that are easily recognizable in the community and that help exemplify the differences in the levels of power that exist among them.) The cards describing the people they will be during this exercise are located in the appendix to this session. Explain that the volunteers should read their cards without sharing who their character is with anyone else during the entire exercise. Alternatively, you can quietly whisper each role to them if they cannot read. Make sure no one else can see who their characters are. The volunteers should envision who their character is, put themselves in their shoes, and imagine how they look and feel. 3
- Give volunteers a moment to think about their identity. When all of the volunteers have read their card, explain how they will conduct the activity. 4
- Explain that you will read out a statement. If the statement is true for their identity, they should take one step forward. If it is not true, they should take one step backward. Volunteers should not return to their starting position after each statement but continue moving forward or backward from wherever they are as each statement is read. 5
- Read one or two statements as a practice before you begin the full activity. 6
- Instruct volunteers not to speak during the exercise. 7

Read each of the following statements in turn, and watch as the volunteers choose to step forward or backward:

- a. 'I have access to money and other financial resources if I need it. '
- b. 'I can choose how to spend the money I earn.'

<!-- image -->

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

- c. 'I have access to transportation and can move freely within my community.'
- d. 'I own land or the house I live in. '
- e. 'If my father or my spouse or partner passes away (or has passed away), I will inherit all or most of their land or property. '
- f. 'I will be respected in any health facility. '
- g. 'I can decide whom to marry and when.'
- h. 'I can walk down any street without fear of harassment or violence.'
- i. 'I feel safe on public transportation. '
- j. 'I can work at most jobs without fear of harassment or violence. '
- k. 'I have a right to demand to have sex with my partner even if he or she doesn't want to.'
- l. 'I can choose to wait to have children if I want. '
- m. 'I have family who can help me if I need help.'
- n. 'I have enough food every day' .
- o. 'I can call the police if my spouse or partner beats me. '
- p. 'I can reach out to my church, friends, or family for help if my spouse or partner abuses me.'
- q. 'I can leave my spouse or partner if I want. '
- r. 'I know my rights, including criminal laws on domestic violence, or I can access legal information. '
17. When all statements have been read, invite volunteers to turn their cards around so that everyone can see their identity or share aloud who their character was. Invite participants to look around and note who has moved forward, who has stayed in the same place, and who has moved backward. 9
- Look around the room at the location of your fellow group members. What stands out for you?
- Who has been able to step the farthest forward? How did it feel to step forward while others fell back?
- Who continued to step backward? Did anyone step backward for every statement?
- What did a person's gender identity - whether they were a man or woman - have to do with this?
- What did a person's age have to do with where they stood?
- How valued is your character in society? How is this reflected in where you are standing?
- Which characters were more powerful? Why? What made different characters more or less powerful?
- Where would certain characters be if instead of being female, they were male, or vice versa? How would their position change?
- What does this teach us about the importance of sharing power in our families? In our communities?
- What is one thing we can each do to share power with others who have less power than us?

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

-  Power is about strength; the way strength is used is what makes the difference.
-  Power does not stay the same. We may experience situations and relationships in which we have more or less power as it intersects with other aspects of our identity.
-  Differences in power do not exist just between women and men but also within groups of men and women. For example, when a man makes all the financial decisions and controls all the money, he has greater power than his wife or female partner does. If that man migrates from his own country to another to earn more money for his family, he may have less power because he is at the mercy of the police and people who might harass him because of his vulnerable position. Higher-income women who can pay for housekeepers often have power over those lower-income women because they pay their salary.
-  All men and women have the ability to decide how to use the power we have inside us. We can use our power alongside that of other members of our family and/or community to change things and transform reality if we decide to do so.
-  In our families and in our communities, we can take small steps to share power more equally among family members. This brings more peace to the family and makes everyone feel more valued and listened to.

## ACTIVITY 3.

## Check-Out and Weekly Commitment

- Explain that the session is ending, and thank everyone for their participation. 1
- Ask the group: 2
-  'Do you have any questions about the session?'
-  'Did you learn something today that will be useful in your own life? If so, what is it?'
- After finishing the questions, share the weekly commitment and confirm the time, date, and place of the next session. 3

## WEEKLY COMMITMENT

Discuss with your spouse or partner what you talked about during today's session and what you would like to do differently to share power more equally at home. Ask your spouse or partner what they think about this, and ask if they are comfortable with the changes you propose. This will  help  them  understand why you are making the changes you are making and be able to support you in making them. Come prepared to share your experience at the next session.

-  ACTIVITY 2: My Father's Legacy (1 HOUR)
-  Check-Out and Weekly Commitment (15 MINUTES)

<!-- image -->

-  'My Father's Legacy' can have a deep emotional impact because participants could remember violent experiences or traumatic events, such as abandonment. It is very important to give the participants emotional support during this process. Generally, this can be achieved by respectfully listening to the participants without judging or pressuring them. It is also important to ensure that anyone who needs extra support is referred to the appropriate services.

Prepare the following tables on flipchart papers:

Study the following concepts and ensure you understand them, as they will help guide conversations in today's session and provide key insights where needed.

## BIOLOGICAL SEX

· refers to the physical characteristics you are born with. It includes a person's anatomy and physical attributes (e.g., external sex organs, sex chromosomes, and internal reproductive system). When these classifications don't line up with what is typically considered a male or female body, the individual is usually referred to as intersex.

## GENDER:

· refers to the way society defines the roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes of men, women, boys, and girls, including people who are transgender. These definitions are not fixed but change over time and are different from society to society. We learn to be our gender by interacting with the world around us. Sometimes, these ideas of how to be a man are thought to be based on our biology rather than something that we learn (e.g., the common myth that violence is a part of men's biology).

## SEXUAL ORIENTATION

· refers to whom you are romantically, emotionally, and/or sexually attracted to. People who are attracted to the opposite sex are heterosexual - men attracted to women, and women attracted to men. People who are attracted to the same sex are homosexual - men attracted to other men, and women attracted to other women. People who are attracted to both are known as bisexual - men attracted to women and men, and women attracted to men and women. People who are not sexually attracted to anyone (but may be attracted emotionally or romantically) are known as asexual.

## KEY CONCEPTS FOR FACILITATORS

ADAPTATION NOTES FOR WE GROUPS

<!-- image -->

-  If you are short on time, do not do 'My Father's Legacy.' However, this activity is highly recommended, as it can be an opportunity to have women think about the changes they'd like to see from their husbands/partners so that these men are more involved in the daily care of their children. This activity was originally designed for men to reflect on and challenge the practices they learned from their own male caregivers.

Ask the following questions for girls/women

Write responses to the questions on the three-column chart for girls/women prepared before the session. Put responses related to the grandmother in the 'Grandmother's Time' column, and responses related to themselves in the 'For You Now' column. Please remember that some participants may be unable to read.

When these questions are posed in the men's group, ask them about their wives/female partners when the question refers to 'you.')

## QUESTIONS

## KEY MESSAGES

Continue the discussion by asking the group discussion questions.

- Will men's and women's roles and norms continue to change in your children's time? If so, in what ways?
- How might the changing roles of men and women and norms affect the kind of work or jobs your daughters will have in the future?
- How might the changing roles of men and women and norms affect the kind of work or jobs your sons have in the future?
-  Remind the participants that gender roles - society's expectations of how to be a man and a woman - are not permanent. They are shaped by society over time. Traditions, popular culture, the media, peers, family, and the community (including schools) all play a role in shaping, reinforcing, and/or changing these gender roles.
-  It is usually young people who contribute to positive changes in gender roles and norms over time. Girls will do different things than their mothers did, and boys will also do different things than their fathers did.
-  It is okay to do things differently than your grandparents or parents did. This has happened in every generation.
-  As gender roles change over time, there will be more equal opportunities for boys and girls in terms of education, work opportunities, and earning potential.

## ACTIVITY 2.

## My Father's Legacy 10

## PURPOSE

Reflect on men's (and women's) relationships with their fathers and how they can take the positive aspects into their relationships with their own children and leave the negative aspects behind; encourage men's active participation in caring for children

## FACILITATOR NOTE

<!-- image -->

Sound system, megaphone

-   As mentioned in the session's introduction, if your WE group is short on time, skip this activity. Otherwise, note the suggested adaptations for women, as this activity was originally designed only for men but is also beneficial for women. This activity can generate strong emotions in the participants. Bear in mind the guidelines for successfully facilitating a session contained in Section 7 at the beginning of this manual. In particular, ensure that you are actively and empathetically listening without judging or interrupting the participants' stories. Create and maintain a safe space for mutual listening and avoid speaking too much yourself to give participants the space to express their emotions. Do not pressure anyone to share. Allow participants to talk about what the exercise evokes to them, promote reflection, and highlight the key messages of the exercise. If any participant shares any painful experiences, is deeply moved, or cries, you can implement any of the following recommendations as you see fit: 11
1.  Don't judge. This isn't always easy, but set aside your own opinions to focus on the other person's perspective. Recognizing the participant's views and emotions will help them feel heard and understood. This doesn't mean you have to agree with everything the person says; it's about letting them know you care.
2. Give the person your full attention. Pay attention with your gaze, your body language, and a warm tone of voice. Maintain eye contact, nodding and giving other cues as appropriate to show you are paying attention, without interrupting. Giving your full attention shows respect, and a person is more likely to remain calm when they feel respected.
3. Listen carefully (feelings and facts). Actively listen to the words and experiences participants describe - as well as the emotions reflected in their tone of voice, body language, and other cues - to go beyond words and identify emotions. Listen with your heart, gaze, voice, and ears.
4. Don't be afraid of silence. Sometimes, all a person needs is to be heard or to know you are there. The person may be thinking about what they are going to say next or may need a few moments of silence to restrain their emotions. Let the person finish speaking before offering a few words of support.
5. Say thank you. Express appreciation for the participants' openness and confidence in sharing their experiences or for being vulnerable. Comment that many of us have had painful experiences with our parents and being able to recognize them can help heal.

11. Recommendations adapted from Crisis Prevention Institute. (2016, October 12). 7 tips for empathic listening. https://www.crisisprevention.com/fr-CA/Blog/7Tips-for-Empathic-Listening

<!-- image -->

6. Consider sitting next to the distressed person. You can hold their hand or rest your hand on their back if appropriate in the context, or you can ask the person if they want to go out and get some air and accompany them if there is a second facilitator.
7. Repeat and paraphrase. Ask questions to confirm and validate experiences that have been shared. Refer to the person's words: For example, 'I heard that Mario felt humiliated when his father insulted him. Is that right?' Keep a respectful and nonjudgmental attitude and give the person time to respond. Remember that there is no script for empathic listening. Respond based on the person, the situation, and the moment.
8.  Resist the temptation to give advice. Limit yourself to listening, validating the experience, being grateful for it having been shared, and looking for common ground with the other participants.
9. Follow up. Between sessions or at the beginning or end of the next session, approach the participant who had been emotionally affected, ask how they have been, and suggest other times to meet if necessary or consider offering information about psychological support services if they are still distressed (see Section 8 at the beginning of the manual, 'Responding to Disclosures Related to Intimate Partner Violence or Mental Health').
5. Explain to the group that in this activity, they will have the opportunity to reflect on their gender roles as fathers (and mothers) and to think about the impact their relationship with their own father has had on their lives. For women, this will also be an opportunity to think about the relationship their husband/male partner has with his father. 1
6. Ask everyone to close their eyes and think about an object or a smell that reminds them of their father. If someone did not grow up with their father, explain that they can think of another man who was important to them during their childhood - such as an uncle, grandfather, or older brother. The object or smell can be a tool, a book, a piece of clothing, the smell of beer, et cetera. 2
7. Tell the group to spend a few minutes focusing on the object or smell they identify with their father. What emotions does this object or smell recall for them? 3
8. After two minutes, ask the group to open their eyes. Tell them to turn to the person sitting next to them and explain the object or smell they identified. 4
9. Ask them to share how it relates to their father or main male role model. 5
10. Once everyone has finished sharing, ask everyone to think about this statement: 'One negative thing that my father did that I do not want to repeat with my own children is…' For the women's group, ask the women how they think their male partner/husband would complete this statement. 6
11. Explain that each person should think about this statement and imagine how they would like to be in the future. Ask them to share their thoughts with the person sitting next to them. Give them five minutes to share. 7

- After everyone has finished sharing with their partner, ask everyone to think about the next statement: ' One positive thing that my father did that I do want to repeat with my own children is...' For the women's group, ask the women how they think their male partner/ husband would complete this statement.. 8
- Ask them to share their thoughts with the person sitting next to them. Give them five minutes to share. 9
- After everyone has finished sharing, ask everyone to come back to the circle and open up a discussion with the entire group using the group discussion questions. 10

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

- What are the positive things about your relationship with your father that you would like to put into practice or teach to your children? Which things would you rather leave behind?
- For women: What are the positive things that you hope your husband or male partner will pass on to your children? What would you prefer that your husband or male partner leave behind?
- How did traditional definitions of what a man should be impact the way our fathers cared for children? (Some examples: Men don't cry; men should not express physical affection with sons and daughters, such as kissing or hugging; men use violence to resolve conflict.)
- How can we 'leave behind' harmful practices to be more involved partners? And how can we participate more and be fathers who value women and men, and our children - as worthy of the same respect, love, and opportunities in life? For women: What are the ways in which you hope your husband or male partner can be involved?
-  The people we are today have been shaped by our experiences growing up, but they do not have to determine who we will become in the future.
-  By reflecting on the past and the relationships you had with your fathers, you can be better fathers (and mothers) to your own children. You can choose to leave behind all of the negative or harmful practices of your father and only carry the positive ones into your relationship with your children.

## ACTIVITY 3.

## Check-Out and Weekly Commitment

- Explain that the session is ending, and thank everyone for their participation. 1
- Ask the group: 2
-  'Do you have any questions about the session?'
-  'Did you learn something today that will be useful in your own life? If so, what is it?'
- After finishing the questions, share the weekly commitment and confirm the time, date, and place of the next session. 3

## FACILITATOR NOTES

M

w

This session's weekly commitment assignment is to go home and start putting into practice some of the ideas you discussed today for how men can play a greater role in caring for their children. Discuss these changes with your wife/ partner and make sure the support you want to provide is also support she wants. Talk it through together and come up with ways that you can work together and contribute to the success of the household. Come back prepared to share your experiences at the next session.

(If They Did 'My Father's Legacy'): Share what you learned in today's session with your partner. Discuss how you would like your husband/partner to be more involved and emotionally connected to your children.

Ask the participants to bring a handkerchief, cloth, or scarf for the next session, which they will need for one of the activities.

-  As a preparatory activity for the next session, try to locate and coordinate with the leaders and group members a wide or open space to carry out the 'Interviewing My Spouse or Partner' activity in the next session. This will avoid their feeling selfconscious about the possibility of being heard by other participant

## PURPOSE

Conduct a trust-building exercise that will form the foundation for the later activities in the session

1

<!-- image -->

Blindfolds (handkerchiefs, cloths, or headscarves brought by the participants or provided by the program)

Explain the exercise by saying this fun activity is meant to build trust between couples:

-  Pair husbands and wives (or male/female partners) together. Have one of the partners be the guide. (Facilitator Note: Give each pair a blindfold, cloth, or scarf to use.)
-  Guides will put the blindfold on their partner. Make sure that the blindfold (or cloth/ scarf) is tight enough so that the partner cannot see anything.
-  Guides will take their blindfolded partner for a walk around the Dialogue Club site. They should not go too far from the area.
-  When you say, 'Stop,' the pairs will change roles. The person who was blindfolded will now be the guide. The guide now has to wear the blindfold.
-  The new guides will walk their blindfolded partner around, trying to explore new places but not going too far from the meeting area.
-  When you say, 'Stop,' they will stop the exercise and come back to the meeting space.
- Begin the exercise. 2
- After it ends, ask these or other questions about being blindfolded:
-  'How did it feel to walk around blind (or visually impaired)?'
-  'Did you trust the person leading you? Why or why not?'
-  'What did the guide do to make you feel more comfortable and safer?'
-  'What did the guide do that made you unsure or uncomfortable?'
- Ask these or other questions about being the guide: 4
-  'What was it like to lead a blindfolded person around?'
-  'Did you give any instructions? Why or why not?'
-  'What kind of instructions did you give?'
-  'Did the instructions work? If not, why?'
-  'What did you do or say to make the blindfolded person more comfortable?'

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Ask the group what they learned from this exercise. 5
- When done, summarize the key messages of the exercise. 6

## KEY MESSAGES

-  To maintain a healthy, open relationship based on equal rights, respect, mutual support, and trust, we need to use good verbal communication skills to explain what we want and our point of view.
-  Good communication also involves having trust in one another.
-  Like you did in the exercise, it is important to show patience, understanding, and respect toward our partner, even when we disagree.

<!-- image -->

## ACTIVITY 2.

## Interviewing My Spouse or Partner 13

## PURPOSE

Describe and practice good communication skills that support an open and trusting intimate relationship

<!-- image -->

NOTE

This exercise should be done in an open area so that couples have enough space to chat privately. If possible, use the open and spacious place that was recommended in the previous session.

- Point out that open-ended questions are best to achieve good communication. This is because: 1
-  They give you more information.
-  Through their answers, people can relay information, feelings, attitudes, and their understanding of the topic.
-  Closed questions that require a yes-or-no answer tend to end the conversation or be met with answers that provide little information and don't allow the respondent's ideas, opinions, and emotions to be known.
- Mention that open-ended questions usually begin with: 2
-  Why?
-  What?
-  When?
-  How?
- Ask the group to give examples of open-ended questions. 3
- As needed, review other examples of open-ended questions: 4
-  What do you think about that?
-  Why did you do that?
-  How do you plan to achieve that?
-  What do you think will happen now?
-  How would you change things?
-  What do you want to happen?
-  What's causing the problem?
-  Can you tell me more?
- Explain that close-ended questions only require a 'yes' or 'no' answer and do not give you much information. 5

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Ask how you can change these close-ended questions into open-ended ones: 6
-  Did you enjoy the Women Empowered session today?
-  Did you cook lunch?
-  Are you upset with me?
- As the facilitator, think of something that made you very happy recently. 7
- Say: 'I am thinking of something that made me very happy. Take turns asking me open-ended questions about what made me happy.' (Examples: 'Why are you very happy?' 'How did this happen?' 'Why does this make you very happy?') Encourage participants to keep asking open-ended questions. 8
- Ask, 'How difficult was it to find out what made me happy?' 9
- Ask the group why we are talking about different kinds of questions. Point out that asking questions can be an opportunity to build and deepen relationships. This will form a solid foundation for times when you disagree. 10
- Ask participants to get back into their pairs. Have them find a place in the room where they can talk and no one will hear them. 11

## FACILITATOR NOTE

-   If they would like to go outside, explain the exercise first and then let them go
- Explain that in this exercise, all they need to do is ask open-ended questions and answer honestly. They should take turns asking these open-ended questions with one another: 12
-  What is a childhood memory you have that has left a mark on your life?
-  Who is someone who inspires you? Why do they inspire you?
-  If you could be anywhere in the world, where would you be and why?
- The person who is asking the questions should listen and not interrupt. However, they can ask follow-up, open-ended questions to find out more about their partner's answer. 13
- Give them 15 to 20 minutes for this exercise, and then have them come back to the circle. 14
- Ask for a couple of volunteers to share their reflections from doing this exercise. Ask the following questions: 15
-  How did it feel when you were listened to?'
-  'How did you feel when you were listening closely to your partner and showing interest?'
-  'What new things did you learn about your partner?'

## KEY MESSAGES

-  This activity demonstrates the importance of a couple creating space to mutually listen with true curiosity and interest in the other person. In our busy day-to-day lives with many obligations and worries, it is sometimes difficult to set aside time to connect with our partner and pay attention to what they are really saying.
-  Dedicating the time and attention to respond to the needs of our partner and to listen carefully to their needs, without judgment, helps strengthen the relationships and make both partners feel appreciated and valued and also know themselves and their partner more.

## ACTIVIDAD 3.

## The Four Phrases  14

## PURPOSE

Discuss the importance of open couple communication and practice creative ways of communicating to successfully resolve conflicts without using violence

<!-- image -->

Illustration/drawing of a couple arguing versus the couple talking with respect

- Ask the group what comes to mind when they hear the words 'problem' or 'couple's disagreement.' Use an example to clarify what 'disagreement' means. (For example, if you wake up in the morning and yell at your partner because there are no clean clothes for the kids and they need to go to school.) 1
- Tell the group that open communication is a very important way to resolve disagreements and can even help us to avoid them in the first place. We will now discuss and practice creative ways of communicating in order to resolve disagreements - ways that can be used in our relationships with our spouses/partners and also with friends, family members, and others. 2
- Show the group the illustrations of (1) the couple communicating in a positive, nonviolent way and (2) the couple yelling or a husband yelling at his wife. (As an alternative to the illustrations, you can draw the face of an angry man and his wife looking sad or scared on one poster; on another poster, you can draw a face of a man smiling and his wife smiling as well.) 3
- Ask the group: 'What are the differences between these two illustrations? Why do you think one couple is arguing or yelling while the other couple is able to communicate with respect? How do you think the woman feels in this situation in each illustration? How do you think the man feels in each illustration?' 4
- Ask, 'When you are upset or having a disagreement with your partner or another family member, do you usually communicate why you are upset? How?' 5
- After the group has finished discussing, you can present them with some sample phrases that can be helpful to communicate our feelings during a conflict (see the following box). Expressing our feelings and speaking in the first person ('I feel, ' 'I see') without accusing (for example, 'because you didn't do the washing') will help the other person know how you feel. 6

I L LUSTRATION 2

## FACILITATOR NOTE

## FOR EXAMPLE

-  The following are some examples of phrases that can be used to communicate one's feelings during a conflict. You can share these phrases with the group as a guide to help facilitate the discussion. Participants should be encouraged to think of their own phrases that can be useful when resolving conflict.

## FOUR PHRASES FOR COMMUNICATING DURING CONFLICT:

-  I can see… This is how we can express the behavior that we see in the other person. For example: 'I can see that you did not greet me when you arrived.'
-  I imagine… This phrase is how we say what we imagine when we observe the other person's behavior. For example: 'I imagine that you are annoyed.'
- I feel… This phrase is how we say to the person what we feel about what we can see and imagine. For example: 'I feel sad, and what happened really hurt me because our relationship is important to me.'
-  I want… This phrase is how we propose how to improve things. For example: 'I want you to tell me if something is bothering you.'
- Ask, 'In what other ways can we communicate without using violence to resolve a disagreement?' 7
- Divide the participants into small groups of three or four individuals each. These groups can be a mix of men and women. Explain that each group will now have 10 minutes to role-play a healthy relationship, using communication rather than violence or aggression to resolve conflict. 8

(As an alternative: If you encounter a lot of resistance from the group on role-playing the scenes, do this activity as a narrated story. Pose an imaginary situation that could occur in the community that represents both modes of communication - positive and conflictive - and then use the question guide to facilitate group reflection on the story.

ex.

-  'Joseph, Martha's husband, came home and realized that the little boy left the door of the chicken coop open and that the chickens ate the vegetables he had planted in the family garden. Joseph, without asking what had happened, began to argue, scream, and beat the chickens to the point of killing one or two. '

(After telling the story, ask the group how the story would change if the four phrases learned were used)

- Explain that each group should imagine a scenario in which a husband and wife are quarreling over how money is spent in the household and both partners are becoming angry. The roleplay should practice communicating to resolve the conflict without resorting to violence. This can use some of the four phrases but does not have to. They should think about how the couple would act and what they would say. 9
- Give the groups 10 to 15 minutes to practice resolving the conflict through dialogue and communication. 10

- Ask one or two small groups to present their role-play to the larger group. 11

12

- Close the activity by asking the group discussion questions.

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

- What were the ways the groups resolved their conflict? What strategies did they use?
- Are these communication methods realistic for resolving problems/conflicts? Why or why not?
- What are the main causes of disagreement or conflict between spouses/partners? What about other types of relationships?
- Often, we know how to avoid a conflict without using violence, but sometimes, this does not happen. Why?
- What are the benefits of communicating your feelings or concerns during a conflict?
- Do you think you could use these skills for communicating in real life? Why or why not?
-  It is important to dedicate time to resolving problems and to not let them fester, as over time, they can deepen and become violent.
-  Conflict always exists and is a normal part of life. It is important to manage conflicts with open communication and respectful listening to express how we feel and to understand the point of view and feelings of the other person.
-  Open communication is a very important way to resolve conflict and can even help us to avoid conflict in the first place.

## WEEKLY COMMITMENT

Say that they will be revisiting their family visions in the next session, so they should be sure to bring their visions next time they meet.

## FACILITATOR NOTE

-  It may be important to remind participants the day before as well.

Explain that the weekly commitment assignment for this session is to start taking steps to build a healthier relationship with your partner. If you find yourselves in conflict, try communicating your feelings to each other rather than shouting or using violence. Think about how it feels. Does it work? Does that type of communication help to reduce tension and understand each other? Come to the next session prepared to share some of the steps you have taken to build a healthier relationship.

- Thank all of the participants for coming to the session. 1
- After a quick energizer, lead a check-in by asking a few volunteers from the group: 2
-  'How are you?'
-  'Has anything new happened since the last session?'
-  After reminding participants of the key messages from Session 5 (listed at the end of the session activities): 'Did you talk with each other as a couple or with your children about what we discussed in the group? If so, what did you share?'
- Explain to the group that this is also the time for them to give feedback on their weekly commitment assignment. Ask the group: 3
-  'How did it go?'
-  'How did you feel after doing the assignment?'
-  'What was the result of the assignment?'
- Share personal insights from the last session that you had as a facilitator, such as anything that you learned or that surprised you about what was discussed. 4
- Tell the group the core purpose of today's session (included in the session's introduction). Add that this session will also explore how working together as a couple (and as a family) creates more equal and happier households. It is also an easy way for men to feel more connected and involved with the family. 5

## ACTIVITY 1.

## Men &amp; Women Working Together as Partners 15

<!-- image -->

## PURPOSE

Explore the differences in how men and women spend their days, focusing on who does the majority of the care and household work; promote a cross-gender dialogue about how it feels to have many burdens and pressures; encourage solutions on how to share the care work fairly between men and women

<!-- image -->

Flipchart paper, tape, markers, and 'Sharing the Housework: Before and After' illustration

- Explain that in this activity, the group is going to reflect on the different ways that men and women spend their days and the time they devote to certain tasks. 1
- Show the 'Sharing the Housework: Before and After' illustration. Ask: 2
-  'What do you notice about the first image? In what ways does it reflect what we saw on the group's 'Man Box' and 'Woman Box' flipchart papers when we first explored gender?'
-  'What do you notice about the second image? How is the husband or male partner sharing the care work with his wife or female partner?'
15. This version of this well-known activity was adapted from Concern Worldwide, Promundo-US, &amp; Rede Homens pela Mudança. (2016). Clube de diálogos: Engajamento dos homens na transformação de género para melhorar a nutrição maternoinfantil [Dialogue club: Engaging men as equitable partners to improve maternal and child nutrition].

<!-- image -->

- Say that this activity will explore how men and women spend their days. 3
- Divide the participants into small groups (three to four people each) based on their sex. Men should be in small groups together with other men, and women should be in small groups together with other women. Give each group a piece of flipchart paper and a marker. 4
- Ask each group to imagine a typical day in the lives of a wife and husband (or male and female partner) in their community and to list on flipchart paper the activities or tasks performed by women and men in a household over 24 hours. 5

FACILITATOR NOTE

-  For low-literacy groups, ask participants to depict the tasks by drawing one object that represents each task carried out within a day, or make sure that each group has one person who is able to take notes. The participants should also identify each task as paid or unpaid.
- After about 15 to 20 minutes, ask each group to stick their flipchart paper on the wall. Ask participants to walk around the room and study the work of the other groups, looking for what is the same and what is different from theirs. 6

- Ask everyone to come back to the circle, and ask each group to briefly present what they wrote, pictured, or discussed within their group. 7
- After the presentations are finished, start the discussion using the group discussion questions. 8

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

<!-- image -->

## ASK THE WOMEN

## ASK THE MEN

## ASK THE WHOLE GROUP

- What differences do you notice between how men and women spend their days?
- Who generally carries out more activities or tasks during the day - men or women? Who generally has more leisure time to spend with friends or family - men or women?
- Do you think these differences are fair? Why or why not?
- Why do we tend to undervalue domestic work, such as cooking or cleaning, and time spent caring for children? And why is paid work seen as having more value?
-  All of you (women and men) are very busy within and outside of the home. What makes it difficult for you to manage all the household activities and to work outside the home and participate in your Women Empowered group?
-  What things could men do to support women in their efforts to generate an income and to contribute economically to the home?
-  Based on what the women said, what activities would you be willing to do to support your wives and partners in their work, both inside and outside of the home?
-  What are the things that men and women could help each other with?
-  What are some of the benefits of men and women working together on these activities? For women? For men? For the family?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

-  Women and men are often raised to perform different caregiving roles, with women usually bearing a significant proportion of the childcare, elder care, and domestic work. This creates an extra burden for women, especially when they are also earning income for the home.
-  When men and women work together to carry out housework, both will have more time to work and participate in other activities that will help the family to prosper.

## ACTIVITY 2.

## Family Visions Revisited

<!-- image -->

## PURPOSE

Revisit the family visions and come to an agreement on how they will be achieved by working together

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Print the photographed family visions from Session 1 beforehand to hand out during this exercise

- Explain that it is time to review the goals that participants set themselves to achieve their family visions. 1
- Ask for the participants to get into their husband-wife/male-female partner pairs and to share their visions with one another if they have not done so previously. To refresh them, remind the participants that the family visions were originally created in men-only and women-only group sessions. In a previous activity, each person reflected on what they want for their family and what long-term goals they have for the family's well-being. Ask them to reflect on the similarities and differences between their family visions. What else would they like to add now that they have gone through several Dialogue Club sessions? 2
- If they have not done so already, each couple should come to an agreement for one shared family vision and draw or write it on their sheet of paper. 3
- After 15 to 20 minutes, ask each couple to share their family vision with the group. Be sure to applaud and thank each couple for sharing their goals. Give words of encouragement, telling them you believe their vision is possible if they work together! 4
- Next, ask each couple to come up with a plan for how they aim to achieve their family vision. Tell them to start small: What can they do as a couple/family in the coming week? What can they do between now and the end of the Dialogue Clubs? What can they do as a couple/ family in the next six months? 5
- Hand out new sheets of paper and markers to all who need them. 6
- Have volunteers share any changes and/or achievements they've already made with regard to their family visions. 7

## ACTIVITY 3.

## Check-Out and Weekly Commitment

- Explain that the session is ending, and thank everyone for their participation. 1
- Ask the group: 2
-  'Do you have any questions about the session?'
-  'Did you learn something today that will be useful in your own life? If so, what is it?'
- After finishing the questions, share the weekly commitment and confirm the time, date, and place of the next session. 3

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## WEEKLY COMMITMENT

Pull  out  the  drawings  from  the  'Man,  Woman,  and  Human  Boxes'  exercise,  or  simply  ask participants to recall what they did in that activity. Ask, 'What did the group say was inside the box? Outside the box?' Ask each participant why is it important for us to come out of our boxes (e.g., it allows us - not society - to define for ourselves who we want to be as men or women).

Tell them to decide on one task that they will do that is outside of their respective gender boxes. Ask a couple of participants (a man and a woman) to share some ideas for activities they can do (e.g. men can sweep the floors or make coffee in the morning; women can spend more time resting or fixing a lightbulb). They should come to the next session ready to discuss how they fared carrying out those tasks.

<!-- image -->

Men and women together OR in separate groups

-  Discuss the negative impact when one partner has more decision-making power than the other in the home
-  Explore how sharing decision-making power equally benefits the entire household
-  Identify steps to improve how decisions are made within the home
-  Role-play scenarios in the appendix

2 hours

-   Check-In (15 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 1: Who Decides? (45 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 2: Decision-Making Role-Play (45 MINUTES)
-  Check-Out and Weekly Commitment (15 MINUTES)
-  Many men are used to and enjoy the power they have as the head of the household. It may be difficult for some men to envision giving up or sharing some of their decision-making power. Encourage them to think of some of the negative aspects that this responsibility can bring and to envision how they could also benefit from their wives'/partners' involvement in decision-making. This can include emotional and physical stress from feeling they must shoulder all of the family's economic burdens and decisions, as well as emotional distance from their partner and children if they believe it is only the woman's responsibility to provide love and care.
-  During the discussion on the impact of inequitable decision-making power within the home, encourage the group to think about the potential negative impacts on different family members, as well as on the household in general. How does this system impact men, women, children, and the success of the family/household?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Thank all of the participants for coming to the session. 1
- After a quick energizer, lead a shorter check-in by asking a few volunteers from the group: ·  ¿'Has anything new happened since the last session?' 2
- Explain to the group that this is also the time for them to give feedback on their weekly commitment assignment. Ask the group: 3
-  'How did it go?'
-  'How did you feel after doing the assignment?'
-  'What was the result of the assignment?'
- Share personal insights from the last session that you had as a facilitator, such as anything that you learned or that surprised you about what was discussed. If any spouses/partners have worked to change some gendered roles in their relationship, recognize and congratulate them. 4
- Tell the group the core purpose of today's session (included in the session's introduction). 5

Six drawings - two drawings of a woman, two of a man, and two of a man and woman together; sticky notes and scotch tape

<!-- image -->

- Explain that in this activity, the group is going to discuss who has power in making decisions within relationships and within the household. 1
- Ask everyone to stand up. Explain that for the first part of the activity, men and women will be separated into two groups. 2
- Divide the room in half and place the three images in different places around one half of the training space: 1) a drawing of a woman; 2) a drawing of a man; and 3) a drawing of a couple; and the same disposition in the other half of the training space. Give each participant some sticky notes (one per question per person). 3

<!-- image -->

- Once the participants have been separated into two groups (men-only and women-only), explain the activity to the group, ensuring that the three drawings are organized around the room. 4
-  Explain: 'You will hear a series of questions about who makes decisions, and the group will have to decide whether a man or a woman usually makes the decision: 'Who decides…''
-  If they believe a man normally makes the decision, they should move toward the image of the man and place their sticky note there. (Optional: You can hang a flipchart paper with the word 'man' or a picture/drawing of a man on the wall if you prefer.)
-  If they believe a woman normally makes the decision, they should move toward the image of the woman and place their sticky note there. (Optional: You can hang a flipchart paper with the word 'woman' or a picture/drawing of a woman on the wall if you prefer.)
-  If they are unsure, or if they believe both men and women make the decision, they can stand in the middle of the room. (Optional: You can hang a flipchart paper with the words 'men and women' or a picture/drawing of a man and a woman on the wall if you prefer.)
-  Explain that some of the decisions you will ask about are related to our relationships, and some of the decisions are related to the family or the household in general.
-  Ask if everyone understands the instructions. It may be helpful to provide an example to the group in order to clarify the instructions.
- Read the first question: 'Who decides who does the housework?' 5
-  After participants move, ask the group to notice where everyone is standing.
-  If there is anyone standing in the middle, ask the person to explain why. (Is it because both men and women sometimes make this decision, or is it because men and women make this decision together?)
- After a short pause, ask the next question and continue in this manner, taking a short pause between questions. (Not every question has to be asked, but it is important to try and get a diversity of responses. If a lot of people are unsure about the questions, encourage the participants to think about who makes the decision most of the time.) 6
-  'Who decides what the family will eat?'
-  'Who decides what crops to grow in the field?'
-  'Who decides to buy or sell major household items (such as livestock)?'
-  'Who decides what to do with the money that is earned?'
-  'Who decides when to have sex?'
-  'Who decides if and when to have children?'
-  'Who decides when their daughter is ready to marry?'
-  'Who decides if children should be punished or disciplined?'

## OPTIONAL:

-  'Who decides how money or cash transfers are invested?'
-  'Who decides when to visit friends or family?'
-  'Who decides on purchases of small household items?'

- After both groups have finished the statements, ask both men and women to come back together in the circle. Start a group discussion using the group discussion questions. 7

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

- What types of decisions are men usually involved in?
- What types of decisions are women usually involved in?
- What did you notice about who makes most of the important decisions?
- Is it fair that some people have more power in decision-making than others?
- What happens when someone does not have power over decisions that directly impact their life?
- What problems occur when only one person in the household makes all the important decisions?
- How do we know when women or men are unhappy about how decisions are being made?
- How can this affect the success of the household we envisioned during the first session?
-  Very often, men make the major household decisions because they are seen by society as the head of the household. These decisions directly impact their wives'/partners' and children's lives and well-being.
-  The imbalance in decision-making power between men and women within our families can have negative consequences for children, women, and men themselves. Some of these negative consequences include:

## MEN

-  Experiencing more emotional and physical stress from feeling that they must be responsible for all of the family's financial resources
-  Feeling symptoms of depression and of wanting to run away from the family to escape these pressures
-  Emotional distance from children if they believe it is only women's role to provide love and care, not men's
-  Unhappy relationships with their wives/partners

## WOMEN

-  Feeling powerless if they are not involved in decision-making in the home when they also have important insights and perspectives
-  Exhaustion from shouldering all of the care and housework
-  Lack of freedom to decide for themselves how they want to spend their days
-  Unhappy relationships with their husbands/partners

## CHILDREN

-  Little emotional connection to their fathers
-  Will replicate these unequal practices when they become adults and enter into their own relationships.

-  There are many benefits when men and women share decision-making, and there are lots of steps families can take to do so! Benefits include happier relationships when there is open communication and shared decision-making! Ask participants what other positive benefits there are when women and men work together to make decisions.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## ACTIVITY 2.

## Decision-Making Role-Play

## PURPOSE

Identify steps to improve how decisions are made within the home

<!-- image -->

Role-play scenarios included in the session's appendix

- Say that this activity will focus on practicing how to make decisions together as a couple. 1
- Mention that a role-play is like a play to reflect a situation that happens in everyday life. 2
- Ask for three or four volunteers for the role-play. Read aloud one of the role-play scenarios in the appendix to this activity. (You can also record the role-plays beforehand in narrated audios to avoid people having to read.) Tell them to decide who will play each role (or assign each person a role). Ask if they have any questions. Give them five minutes to practice their roleplay before they perform it for the larger group. Tell them the role-play should be no longer than five minutes. 3
- While the small group of volunteers practices their role-play, do an energizer from the end of this manual with the other group members. . 4
- Have the group perform their role-play. After they finish, give them a big round of applause and thank them for being brave enough to perform for the group. Ask the entire group: 5
-  'What did you like about this role-play?'
-  'How did the characters come to a decision to resolve the problem and consider each other's needs and perspectives even if different from their own?'
-  'Is there anything you would have added to strengthen the role-play?'
- Next, break all participants into three groups. Assign each group a role-play from the remaining scenarios in the appendix to this activity. Read them the role-play scenarios several times to ensure each group understands what they will do. Tell them they must come up with a roleplay that is no longer than five minutes. 6

(Alternative: If the group is reluctant to do the role plays, have them use the scenario in the appendix as a case study; ask them to think about how the protagonists of the story might make decisions so that none of them imposes themselves by force or pressures the other person, and ask them to decide how the story unfolds.)

- Participants should think about how a family can come to a decision together and also how they can utilize the communication skills they've used so far to listen openly and calmly to one another, so as to consider each other's needs and perspectives. 7

<!-- image -->

- After 10 to 15 minutes, have the groups come back together and perform the role-plays one by one. After each group finishes, ask the whole group: 8
-  'What did you like about this role-play?'
-  'How did the characters come to a decision to resolve the problem and consider each other's needs and perspectives even if different from their own?'
-  'Is there anything you would have added to improve communication and resolve the problems dealt with in the role-play?'
- Thank everyone for their excellent performances. 9

## KEY MESSAGE

-  Making decisions together can be difficult or challenging when we are not used to doing so as couples. Think about what we learned in previous sessions about the gender roles we have been assigned. They are learned over time, and it is difficult to change practices overnight, but working together is worth it. It can help the family prosper and become happier.

## ACTIVITY 3.

## Check-Out and Weekly Commitment

- Explain that the session is ending, and thank everyone for their participation. 1
- Ask the group: 2
-  'Do you have any questions about the session?'
-  'Did you learn something today that will be useful in your own life? If so, what is it?'
- After finishing the questions, share the weekly commitment and confirm the time, date, and place of the next session. 3

<!-- image -->

## WEEKLY COMMITMENT

This session's weekly commitment assignment is to try to make at least one household decision jointly. Participants should go home and discuss how decisions are made in the home. Are there decisions women would like to be involved in? Discuss the decision: What are your priorities? What are  your  spouse's/partner's  priorities?  Then,  come  to  a  common  agreement.  Come  to  the  next session prepared to share how this process went and how it made you feel.

ROLE-PLAY #1 - TERESA AND MANUEL

ROLE-PLAY #2 - RICARDO AND MARÍA

ROLE-PLAY #3 - LAURA AND DANIEL

ROLE-PLAY #4 - ANA AND MIGUEL

Teresa is married to Manuel. She would like to become a member of a Women Empowered group, but doing so means that she would have to participate in the meetings one evening per week. This would take her away from the family and her caregiving responsibilities. Manuel's mother, Ines, also lives with them, and Teresa knows her mother-in-law would also have a problem with this. Ines believes that women's role is in the home. Teresa makes a plan to speak with Manuel and Ines at dinner. Create a role-play about what happens next, taking into account everyone's points of view and joint decision-making as a couple.

Richard is worried about money and can't sleep. He usually works most of the year for a large landowner planting seasonal crops, but he was injured in a car accident a few months ago and hasn't been able to work. He wants to talk to his wife, Maria, about what to do, but he is ashamed. He does not want to worry her or their two children about money. However, he sits down for breakfast one morning and decides to talk to her. Create a role-play about what happens next, taking into account everyone's points of view and joint decision-making as a couple.

Laura and Daniel have a 13-year-old son, Hugo. Hugo used to be an easygoing child who always did well in school. However, in the past couple of months, Laura has been hearing from Hugo's teacher that he has been skipping class and failing tests. Daniel has also noticed that Hugo has been in a bad mood, locking himself in his room and hanging out with older boys, often not coming back until late at night. In his day, when Daniel was a kid, his father would have beat him if he behaved like this, but Daniel and Laura want to do things differently. Create a role-play about what happens next, taking into account everyone's points of view and joint decision-making as a couple.

Ana and Miguel live in a happy home, but their neighbors do not. Often, Ana will come home after a day of work at a small shop and hear the husband next door yelling at his crying wife. Sometimes, these arguments will continue late into the night. Ana thinks the husband is physically abusing his wife, too. Miguel also wants to do something, but he doesn't want to get anyone in trouble. That evening, he and Ana have a discussion about what to do. Create a role-play about what happens next, taking into account everyone's points of view and joint decision-making as a couple.

Men and women together

-  Learn about the importance of establishing shared family financial goals
-  Learn how to create a family budget
-  Make a plan on how resources will be saved to reach financial goals
-  Markers
-  Flipchart
-  Tape
-  Pens/Pencils
-  Copies of budget worksheet in the session's appendix
-  Pictures or clippings that represent different aspects of budgeting
- 2 hours
-  Check-in (15 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 1: Discussing Family Finances (30 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 2: Making a Family Budget (1 HOUR)
-  Check-Out and Weekly Commitment (15 MINUTES)
-  Talking about money can be difficult, particularly when couples have never had an open discussion about finances before. Be aware of the dynamics in the group and ensure that both men's and women's voices are heard during the discussions. It is important to challenge men's dominance over these decisions.
-  For Low-Literacy Groups: If participants are not comfortable using the household budget worksheet, they can simply follow the activity and listen to the prompts of the facilitator. They can write down some notes or mentally do the calculations instead.
-  The household budgeting activity focuses on developing a one-week plan. Encourage those who are able to budget for longer periods to think about how they can do so. In many instances, a family's income may not be stable or predictable enough to budget far in advance.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Thank all of the participants for coming to the session. 1
- Start the check-in by using a quick energizer. Refer to the end of the manual or to the WE handbook on icebreakers for ideas or choose to sing a song or dance. . 2
- Ask a few volunteers from the group: 3
-  'How are you?'
-  'Has anything new happened since the last session?'
-  After reminding participants of the key messages from Session 7 (listed at the end of the session activities): 'Did you talk with each other about what we discussed in the group? If so, what did you share?'
- Explain to the group that this is also the time for them to give feedback on their weekly commitment assignment. Ask the group:: 4
-  'How did it go?'
-  'How did you feel after doing the assignment?'
-  'What was the result of the assignment?'
- Share personal insights from the last session that you had as a facilitator, such as anything that you learned or that surprised you about what was discussed. Be sure to highlight or recognize any progress shown by the couples in their weekly assignments. If a participant wishes to do so, they might share what their spouse/partner is doing to try to communicate effectively and respectfully or to share decisions. Recognize and congratulate this success. 5
- Tell the group the core purpose of today's session (included in the session's introduction). 6

## ACTIVITY 1.

## Discussing Family Finances

<!-- image -->

## PURPOSE

Learn about the importance of establishing shared family financial goals

<!-- image -->

Flipchart paper and markers; pictures or clippings that represent different aspects of budgeting

- Explain to the participants that this session is focused on building skills together to manage family finances. 1
- Divide the participants into small groups based on sex. There should be at least one group of men and one group of women. Depending on the group size and the availability of facilitators, there can be multiple groups of men and multiple groups of women. Be sure to coordinate the support of another facilitator for carrying out this exercise. 2
- Hand out flipchart paper and colored markers to each group. Tell them that they are going to do an exercise on their priorities for the household budget. First, they will do an individual exercise and then share the flipchart papers they prepare. 3
- Ask participants to discuss in their small group the typical expenses a family would have in one month. After two or three minutes, ask each small group to share their answers with the wider group. Write or draw these expenses on flipchart paper for everyone to see. 4

ex.

## FOR EXAMPLE:

-  School fees to send children to school
-  Purchasing medicines or going to the health center
-  Investing in the family business (e.g., buying tools, supplies), if applicable
-  Home repairs
-  Food
-  New clothes or shoes
- Electricity bills
- Next, each group will do the following: Discuss their priorities on how to spend family income in one month, and then draw pictures for each of those priorities on the flipchart paper. 5
- After 10 minutes, tell the groups to discuss which item is the #1 priority, #2 priority, and so on. They should put a number (1, 2, 3…) next to each picture, according to the order of importance. (They can also use colors to portray their importance.) 6

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- After 15 minutes, ask the groups to come back to the circle. Invite one representative from each group to share some of the feedback from the group discussion. 7
- After the groups have presented, start a discussion using the group discussion questions. 8

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## ASK THE MEN

- Did anything surprise you about the priorities presented by the women?

## ASK THE WOMEN

- Did anything surprise you about the priorities presented by the men?
- Is it easy to decide the priorities for the budget? Why or why not?
- How can men and women work together to make financial decisions if they have different priorities?
- How does your family decide how money is spent?
- Who decides how to use money in the family?
- Do you normally discuss household finances and make decisions together? Why or why not?
- Is there anyone else you think should be involved in making decisions, or providing ideas, on how the family's budget should be managed?
-  Men and women sometimes have different priorities and ideas for how family finances should be spent. It is important to talk about these priorities and to agree together on how money is spent.
-  If men and women work together to manage the finances, money can be spent in ways that most effectively contribute to the well-being of the family.

<!-- image -->

## ACTIVITY 2.

## Making A Family Budget 17

## PURPOSE

Learn how to create a family budget; make a plan for how resources will be saved to reach financial goals

## MATERIALS

<!-- image -->

Copies of the budget worksheet (included in the appendix of this session) for all couples; paper, pencils/pens, and exercise books (if possible)

- Explain that in this activity, each couple will work on their own household budget. 1
- Ask the couples to sit next to each other, and give each couple a copy of the budget worksheet. If someone's partner is not present, they can complete the worksheet by themselves. 2

## FACILITATOR NOTE

-  For low-literacy groups, if participants are not comfortable using the household budget worksheet, they can simply follow the activity and listen to the prompts of the facilitator. They can write down some notes or mentally do the calculations instead.
- Draw a copy of the worksheet format onto the flipchart paper large enough for everyone to see clearly. 3
- Explain to the group that you are going to lead them through the worksheet one step at a time. It may be a good idea to have an example so that everyone has an idea of how to use the worksheet before they do their independent work. 4
- Tell the group to look at Step 1 on the worksheet and ask the group, 'What expenses does your family have in a week (or month)?' 5

## FACILITATOR NOTE

-  You should decide if participants will discuss weekly or monthly budgeting based on participants' recall ability (if monthly is challenging, use weekly expenses). The worksheet may need to be adjusted depending on which you choose and your local context (i.e., changing weekly to monthly and using currency/quantities appropriate to your context).
- a. Explain that each couple should think about the weekly (or monthly) expenses they have for the family.
- b. They should list all of the money that they spend as a family. (Facilitator Note: If literacy is low in the group, you can ask the couple to speak to each other but not write down the information or write down only the numbers.) This can include paying for the house, water, electricity, transportation, food, security, and so on.
- c. Allow enough time for the couples to discuss and write down their responses.
- Tell the group to look at Step 2 and ask the group: 'How much money does your family earn in a week (or a month)?' 6
- a. Explain that each couple should think about the weekly (or monthly) income of their family.

- b. They should list all of the sources of income that are coming into the household. This can include money from small business activities, from regular jobs, or from family members.
- c. Allow enough time for the couples to discuss and write down their responses.
3. Tell the group to look at Step 3 and ask the group: 'Does your family earn enough money to pay all of its expenses?' 7
- a. Explain that this question is based on the first two steps.
- b. Couples should take the total from Step 2 (how much they earn) and see if it is enough to cover all of the costs in Step 1. If the amount in Step 2 is larger than the amount in Step 1, the family has enough money to survive and meet its expenses. If the amount in Step 2 is smaller than the amount in Step 1, the family does not have enough money.
- c. Allow couples enough time to discuss their responses with each other.
7. Tell the group to look at Step 4 and ask, 'What items do you spend money on that are necessities for your children?' 8
- a. Explain that each group should examine their family's budget and circle those expenses (Step 1) that are associated with the basic needs of their children, highlighting as much as possible any differences in allocation of resources to their sons versus to their daughters.
- b. Ask the couples to identify how much of their family budget contributes to the development of their children.
- c. Allow enough time for the couples to discuss this question.
11. After the couples have completed the four steps, open up the discussion using the group discussion questions. 9

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

- What do you think about the practice of writing down your family's budget? Is it possible to do this every week (or month) in your own family?
- What are some difficulties or challenges you might have in making your budget?
- How do you think money should be best spent to support the family's and children's well-being?
- Do households ever spend money on items that do not promote the family's well-being? Why?
- What are some of the consequences when money is not well spent?
- How could this situation be improved?
-  Making financial decisions together is a key part of a strong relationship and helps to build trust.
-  By creating a budget, you can clearly see how to better manage spending, savings, and investments. It is a good practice to do regularly in order to maintain the financial health of the family. Consider involving older children in this activity to instill in them the values of managing money.

## ACTIVITY 3.

## Check-Out and Weekly Commitment

- Explain that the session is ending, and thank everyone for their participation. 1
- Ask the group: 2
-  'Do you have any questions about the session?'
-  'Did you learn something today that will be useful in your own life? If so, what is it?'
- After finishing the questions, share the weekly commitment. 3
- Tell participants that the WE group will do an activity during their next WE group meeting in preparation for the next joint session (Session 9). 4
- Confirm the time, date, and place of the next session. 5

## WEEKLY COMMITMENT

Explain to the group that the weekly commitment assignment for today's session is to go home and, using the information you discussed today, make a budget plan for one week. Practice discussing the different priorities you each have for the family this week and share the financial decisions. Come prepared to share this experience at the next session.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The following questions can help you to develop a weekly, monthly, or annual budget for your family. Some costs only occur once a month or twice a year - so you need to make sure to include these when you budget for longer periods of time. Creating a long-term budget plan can help you identify the future needs of your family and save money to meet these costs. On this worksheet, you will also find a budget template that you can use to develop a family budget after the session ends.

1. WHAT EXPENSES DOES YOUR FAMILY HAVE?

Write all of your costs for this week (e.g., food, clothing, housing, phone, and transportation) in the blank table, as in the following example.

<!-- image -->

| ITEM                                  | SPENDING PER WEEK   |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Transportation (Car, Motorbike, Bus…) | Q3,000              |
| Food                                  | Q5,000              |
| Housing                               | Q15,000             |
| Phone                                 | Q5,000              |
| Total Spending                        | Q28,000             |

| ITEM           | SPENDING PER WEEK   |
|----------------|---------------------|
| TOTAL SPENDING |                     |

2. HOW MUCH DOES YOUR FAMILY EARN

## EXAMPLE

<!-- image -->

Write all of your income for this week (e.g., selling goods at the market, money earned from employment) in the blank table, as in the following example.

| ITEM                  | EARNINGS PER WEEK   |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Selling at the Market | Q2.000              |
| Construction Work     | Q3.000              |
| TOTAL EARNINGS        | Q5.000              |

| ITEM           | EARNINGS PER WEEK   |
|----------------|---------------------|
| TOTAL EARNINGS |                     |

3. Do you bring in enough money to cover your costs or not enough? Is your total weekly spending more than your total weekly earnings? If yes to the second question, what could you do to better budget the money you have?

4. What items do you spend money on that are necessities for your children? With the money you spent, did you buy all of the things your children need to grow and develop? Are there better ways to spend your money on your family?

## 2 hours

-  Check-In (15 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 1: What Makes a Good Leader? (30 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 2: Supporting Women's Leadership (1 HOUR)
-  Check-Out and Weekly Commitment (15 MINUTES)
-  Before doing Session 9, it is essential to do the preparatory session for the WE group. The activities for this preparatory session are listed in the next section. The purpose of this preparatory session is to create a space for women to reflect on their own goals and aspirations to become leaders. This session will enable women to articulate their perspectives more effectively on women's leadership in the later joint session.

BACKGROUND I NFORMATION ON WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP IN HUEHUETENANGO

-  Prepare the following chart on a large piece of flipchart paper for Activity #2 ('Supporting Women's Leadership'):
-  The formative research we undertook in Huehuetenango, Guatemala, reflects that dominant community norms and shared beliefs tend to support men as those entitled to occupy both formal and informal leadership positions or roles in the community, such as in Community Development Committees (COCODEs) and School Parent Associations while community norms sustain women's role to be confined to taking care of the family and domestic work. This is based on misconceptions about an innate male capacity to lead as opposed to women's capacity to make decisions related to managing resources.
-  Examples from our communities in Guatemala, as well as other communities in the region, show that women and men are equally capable of being active leaders when they are given the opportunity and have the integrity, commitment, and skills to do so.
-  Preventing women from participating as leaders in their communities stifles their potential to contribute to their own development and growth and to their families' and communities' .
-  In this session, you can remind men of the 'Man, Woman, and Human Boxes' exercise they did earlier, as well as of the importance of listening to women and of creating a safe space, given that women are often not given the same space to be heard when discussing issues that concern them beyond the family and the home. Encourage men to take the role of allies to their spouses in this journey and to step to the side so that women can step up. Bear in mind that this can be a sensitive issue for many men. It would be useful for you to have some experiences on hand that you can share to sensitize the group about the importance of women's participation.

A leader is someone who has the ability to lead, guide, and influence other individuals, a group of people, or an organization. People who are good leaders can support initiatives to help improve the social, cultural, and economic conditions and advance development within their community. KEY CONCEPT

## WE Group Preparation for Session 9 (WOMEN ONLY): Supporting Women's Leadership

Four activities are proposed in preparation for the joint men-and-women's session on women's leadership (Session 9). The purpose of these activities is to facilitate women's reflection and to discuss how can they become - or strengthen and support - good women leaders among their group and/or community. You can facilitate the four activities, or if you don't have enough time, select #1 and #3.

<!-- image -->

## ACTIVITY 1.

## RECOGNIZING OUR VALUE

minutes 30

- Explain to participants that each one of them is unique and valuable. They are women of initiative who care about their families and communities, and they also need to appreciate themselves and take care of themselves to stay healthy, stay happy, and contribute to their community. 1
- Appreciate and name qualities and strengths of theirs that you have learned over the course of the sessions. 2
- Tell them that you will play a game, 'The Bottle of Qualities. ' 18 3
- Sit the participants in a circle and place the bottle in the center. 4
- Ask someone to begin by spinning the bottle. When it stops, they will tell the participant whom the bottle is pointing at about a strength she has and how she could use it to contribute to the development of the community. 5
- Then, the woman who was named spins the bottle, continuing until everyone has had a chance to hear a quality they have and how it can contribute to the community. 6

## ACTIVITY 2.

## CAN YOU HEAR ME?

## FACILITATOR NOTE

minutes 10

-   If you hold the WE sessions in a space near other houses, be sure to notify any neighbors that you will be making a lot of noise during this session so they do not become concerned!
- Standing in a circle, tell the women to take slow, deep breaths. Tell them to imagine their lungs filling up with air and then emptying slowly through their mouths. 1
- Next, tell them that they will start saying the phrase, 'I am powerful' over and over again, softly at first and then louder and louder until they are yelling as loud as they can, 'I AM POWERFUL!' while they start taking large steps around the room. 2
- As they are yelling, tell them to start taking big steps around the room outside the circle and to wave their arms. They should continue loudly saying, 'I AM POWERFUL!' as they move. 3
- After another minute, tell them to come back to the circle and sit down. 4

## ACTIVITY 3. I F   I   W E R E   A   L E A D E R

<!-- image -->

- Ask, 'How did it feel to do the warm-up exercise?' (only if they did Activity #2; otherwise, start with the next question). 1
- Ask, 'Why is it unusual for women to speak in a loud voice and take up a lot of physical space? What does this have to do with the 'Woman Box' we talked about in the second session?' 2
- Make the point that it is common in society to disregard women as leaders because society does not believe them to be as intelligent or capable as men. Women are usually stereotyped as being 'too emotional' or as not having 'enough experience' to make important decisions on their own. 3
- Ask the women what they think about this. 4
- Ask, 'How do these beliefs discourage women from taking on leadership positions?' 5
- Ask, 'Where do these beliefs come from?' 6
- To close, do a brainstorming exercise with the women. Invite each woman to close her eyes and visualize people she trusts expressing how much they value her and how they could support her in carrying out her initiatives. Ask the women to connect with how this makes them feel, open their eyes, and share what they would do if they were supported and trusted, starting with the phrase, 'If I were a leader in this community, I would…' 7
- Write these ideas on a flipchart paper. Congratulate the women on these excellent ideas for making their community a better place. 8
- Close the discussion by saying that in the next session, they will discuss with men the importance of women's leadership and how men can support women in achieving their goals. 9

132

## ACTIVITY 4. CONVERSATION WITH A WOMAN LEADER

<!-- image -->

- If possible, invite a respected or notable woman from the community to a WE session to share her life experience and how she overcame obstacles to achieve her life goals. You can share these questions 19 in advance for her to prepare her story to share with the group: 1
-  What did you want to achieve in life (your goals) when you were 15 to 20 years old?
-  What goals have you achieved in your life?
-  What steps did you follow to achieve that objective?
-  What difficulties did you have to confront to achieve your goals?
-  What strategies have you used to overcome difficulties?
-  Which other women did you find support from to carry out your plans? What other people were helpful and supportive?
-  How have you supported other women?
-  How do you think husbands/male partners, family, and others in the community need to support women for women to realize their goals? What rights do you think should be protected for all women?
- Facilitate a discussion so that the women can ask the guest speaker questions and also reflect on what contributed to her success in accomplishing her goals, what support she received, and how she used the opportunities she had. 2

## Supporting Women's Leadership (MEN AND WOMEN TOGETHER)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Thank all of the participants for coming to the session. 1
- After an energizer, lead a check-in by asking a few volunteers from the group: 2
-  'How are you?'
-  'Has anything new happened since the last session?'
-  After reminding participants of the key messages from Session 8 (listed at the end of the session activities): 'Did you talk to anyone about what we discussed in the group? If so, what did you share?'
- Explain to the group that this is also the time for them to give feedback on their weekly commitment assignment. Ask the group: 3
-  'How did it go?'
-  'How did you feel after doing the assignment?'
-  'What was the result of the assignment?'
- Share personal insights from the last session that you had as a facilitator, such as anything that you learned or that surprised you about what was discussed. 4
- Tell the group the core purpose of today's session (included in the session's introduction). Explain that this session is very important because it will address a taboo issue - women taking on positions of power and leadership. Many men often fear that when women gain rights and power, men lose out, but this is not true! As the previous sessions have shown, there are many benefits for everyone - men included - when power and responsibilities are shared. In this session, it is important for men to keep an open mind and open heart. 5
- 6

Remind everyone of the group agreements.

## PURPOSE

Reflect on and foster women's ability to become leaders

<!-- image -->

Flipchart paper, tape, and markers; 'Woman Box' flipchart paper from the earlier session

- Ask participants to silently think of a leader (man or woman) they admire and think of the qualities that make them a good leader. It doesn't need to be a famous leader; it can be someone in the community who embodies the qualities they believe a good leader has. Tell them that leaders can have very different styles and that there is not only one way to be a leader. 1
- Next, ask participants to silently think of a leader (man or woman) they dislike and to think of the qualities that make them a bad leader. 2
- Ask for the group to share the qualities of good and bad leaders and write them on the flipchart paper. 3
- Discuss the differences and similarities of the qualities that are listed on the flipchart paper. Is there anything surprising listed? What does it mean to them to be a good leader? 4
- Compare the 'Good Leader' list of qualities they compiled with the content of the 'Woman Box' from an earlier session. Place the 'Woman Box' flipchart paper on the wall so that participants can clearly compare them. 5
- Ask, 'What do you notice about the differences between these two flipchart papers?' 6
- Ask, 'What do women who are good leaders have in common? What differences are there among these women? What steps did these good women leaders take to achieve their goals? What strategies did they use to surmount challenges and difficulties that they faced?' 7
- Say that there are many stereotypes that discourage women from taking on positions of power, such as the myths that women are not as intelligent as men, they are too emotional, and they do not do well under pressure. 8
- Ask, 'Where do these beliefs come from? Why does society discourage women from being leaders? What stereotypes have you heard? What fears may men have in particular about women taking on positions of power?' (Examples: Men may fear that women might 'take over' and make decisions they find threatening; there is fear of loss of control over women.) 9

<!-- image -->

- Ask, 'In what ways can our community benefit from having more women in positions of power? How does this benefit women? Our children? Men?' 10
- Ask, 'How can we support each other, as strong and valuable women, to ensure the well-being of women, their families, and communities?' 11

<!-- image -->

## ACTIVITY 2.

## Supporting Women's Leadership

<!-- image -->

## PURPOSE

Discuss what women need to reach their goals of becoming leaders in the community and/ or how they can support other women to lead; brainstorm the different ways men and other people in positions of power can support women's leadership in the community

## MATERIALS

<!-- image -->

Paper and pencils/pens (optional); be sure to coordinate support for carrying out the activity by bringing in another facilitator since smallgroup work will be used

- Tell the participants that in life we all have goals that we want to accomplish and we make many efforts to achieve them. In order to achieve our goals, we rely on two key things in life: (1) the people that join their power with us and support us as a team so that we can achieve our goals; and (2) the power within that we all have inside us, the strengths and our own personal qualities. 1
- Explain that you will be reading a story of a young woman who wished to achieve several goals in her life and that you will help her plan how to reach them. 2
- Read the following story: 3

<!-- image -->

'Since Nora was born, her mom has told her about all the great things that she can do in her life thanks to her qualities and strengths and the support of her family. This morning in the market, people were talking about three female neighbors she knew who crossed the border and migrated up north in search for better opportunities. She was very sad to know that her friends were at risk and in danger. Nora didn't want to have to go to the United States to work, but she knew that poverty often forces young women to leave their communities. At the Women Empowered group, the facilitator asked participants to think of their dreams and plans, as well as the strategy they would follow to achieve them. The first step was to identify the goals each one has. For Nora, it was very easy - she had so many goals that she could fill a whole page. The facilitator then asked her to select one goal for each category (family, relationships, education…). '

<!-- image -->

- Display the flipchart paper you prepared with the following table, noting the categories in the 4

lefthand column.

|                                       | Goals   | Action to Achieve My Goal   | Challenge I Will Face   | Strength I Have to AchieveMyGoal   | Support I Will Need   |
|---------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Family Relationships                  |         |                             |                         |                                    |                       |
| Education/Work/Economic Opportunities |         |                             |                         |                                    |                       |
| Savings                               |         |                             |                         |                                    |                       |
| Community                             |         |                             |                         |                                    |                       |

<!-- image -->

- Split the group into men-only and women-only groups. Ask the women to think on their own and complete the chart with the goals they would like to achieve, an action they will take to achieve it, a challenge they expect to find, a strength that will enable them to achieve their goal and overcome challenges, and what support they will need to achieve it. Give them 15 minutes to think and write or draw an important goals they want to achieve in their lifetime. (If they can't draw a picture that represents a goal, tell them to think of an object that reminds them of that goal. For example, if the goal is, 'I would like to form a cooperative of women weavers to support each other and sell our products in other towns,' she can draw a ball of wool and many hands representing the work of many women weaving.) 5
- For the men, show them the illustration 'Women Have Goals!' Start a group discussion by asking them what goals each of these women have. What kind of goal would a woman have if she wanted to be a leader in this community? What are ways the men in these women's lives can support them in reaching their goals? Are these actions realistic? Write these ideas on a flipchart paper. 6
- After the 15 minutes are up, ask some women if they would like to share their life plans. 7
- After all of the women participants have shared their life plans, ask the men: 8
-  'How can you support them in realizing their goals?'
-  'How do you think others can support them in realizing their goals?'
-  After reminding them of the types of power discussed in Session 3, 'How will you use your power to support these women?'
-  'What are the benefits when women achieve their goals? For herself? For her family? For the community?'
-  We all have power inside to create positive change in our own lives and in the community. We can also work with others to this end or support someone to use their power in positive ways. Sometimes, women are not allowed to use the power they have within to become leaders in their communities and accomplish their goals. We can all use our power to support women to become leaders and accomplish their goals.
- Each one of you has strengths to advance your goals and to improve your life and the life of the community.
- Men's support is critical to enable women to accomplish their goals by recognizing their value and believing in their capacity to perform any activity they set their sights on. As we've seen in previous sessions, men benefit when women have more control over their lives and decisions! Women can support each other and remind each other of the strengths and qualities they have.

## FACILITATOR NOTES

-  Invite a sexual and reproductive health provider from Casa Materna (and/or any other GC staff or partner who has knowledge about sexual and reproductive health, including services) to come and discuss the topics related to how couples can prevent pregnancy and the contraceptive methods available to them. You can also consider inviting staff from the ministry of health or social protection in your locality or from other municipal- or community-level services, if they are available and able to mobilize. If no one from Casa Materna or other services is available, you can conduct the session yourself. Share the material with the people you invite in advance and explain to them the objective of the program and the topics addressed in the previous sessions. Share written facilitation recommendations and/or suggestions for developing this activity, including the recommendation to bring a contraceptive method kit as training material.
-  If you conduct the session yourself, please do the following:
-  Be sure to read through all of the session's instructions and become familiar with the basic topics that will be discussed:
- The menstrual cycle and how it works
- Conception and how it happens
- Parts of the female reproductive anatomy
- Main methods of contraception and basic details about how they work
-  Practice explaining these topics to a work colleague, a health provider, or a trusted member of your family to make sure your explanations are clear and correct.
-  During the session, do not be afraid to refer back to the manual to make sure your explanations are correct.
-  You are not expected to be an expert! If you do not know the answer, say that you will find out the answer and come with it to the next session or ask for a volunteer from the group to find out the answer.
-  If you'd like to feel more informed, check out the following online resources to learn more about sexual and reproductive health. (Note for Global Communities using this Manual in different countries or regions. Consider include relevant resources providing objective information about modern contraceptive methods and sexual and reproductive health for the setting you are in; the following are examples used in Guatemala:
-  APROFAM in Guatemala: https://www.aprofam.org.gt/educacion-sexual/
-  National Family Planning Guide:  https://data.miraquetemiro.org/sites/default/files/ documentos/Guia-nacional-de-Planificacion-familiar-Guatemala.pdf

- Thank all of the participants for coming to the session.. 1
- After a quick energizer, lead a check-in by asking a few volunteers from the group:: 2
-  'How are you?'
-  'Has anything new happened since the last session?'
-  After reminding participants of the key messages from Session 9 (listed at the end of the session), 'Did you talk to anyone about what we discussed in the group? If so, what did you share?'
- Explain to the group that this is also the time for them to give feedback on their weekly commitment assignment. Ask the group: 3
-  'How did it go?'
-  'How did you feel after doing the assignment?'
-  'What was the result of the assignment?'
- Share personal insights from the last session that you had as a facilitator, such as anything that you learned or that surprised you about what was discussed. 4
- Tell the group the core purpose of today's session (included in the session's introduction). 5

## PURPOSE

Learn about the menstrual cycle and how conception happens

<!-- image -->

## NOTES

If the activity is facilitated by an expert partner, be sure to create an atmosphere of trust before the invitee's intervention. As much as possible, the GC facilitator should carry out this activity in order to create an environment of trust and security for the members of the group.

- Say that one of the most important decisions a couple can make is if, when, and how many children they will have. However, having sex is not only about reproduction. Couples have sex for pleasure and intimacy, too! Sex is an important way for them to bond and strengthen their relationship if it is done in a consensual way - meaning both partners want to have sex. 1
- Tell the group that today's session will focus on how couples can prevent pregnancy if they are not ready to have a(nother) child. 2
- Ask if anyone knows about the menstrual cycle and how it works. Get as many responses as possible. 3
- Using the illustration provided, review the menstrual cycle, covering these points: 4
-  A woman's menstrual cycle is typically between 21 and 35 days. Some are shorter, and some are longer.
-  About 12 to 16 days after the last menstrual period, a woman ovulates, meaning her body releases an egg. This is called ovulation.
-  After the egg has been released, it travels through the fallopian tube to the uterus.
-  During ovulation, as the egg moves through the fallopian tube and uterus, the woman is fertile. If she has sex around that time, she can get pregnant.
-  An egg and sperm can meet when a man and woman have sex, especially during the time the woman is fertile.
-  The sperm can live up to five days inside the woman. So even if a woman has sex before ovulation, she can become pregnant.
- Ask the group if anyone has heard of the term 'conception' and what it means. Get as many responses as possible. 5
- Using the illustration provided, discuss conception, covering these key points and showing where these six steps happen: 6
1. An egg and sperm can meet when a man and woman have sexual intercourse,

<!-- image -->

144

Ovary •

• Fallopian tubes

Cervix - after the man ejaculates sperm into the woman's vagina. The egg is in the fallopian tube, and the sperm travels up from the vagina to find the egg.

2. When an egg and sperm meet, the sperm penetrates the egg; they fuse together and become one cell, called the zygote. This is called conception. It usually happens in the fallopian tube.
3. The zygote then grows and develops into an embryo.
4. After a couple of days, the embryo travels down the fallopian tube and attaches to the uterus, which is lined with blood and nourishing tissue.
5. The embryo grows into a fetus in the uterus.
6. Over nine months, the fetus develops into a baby until it is ready to be born.
6. Ask if there is anything they learned that surprised them. Explain that the next activity will show the best ways to avoid conception using contraceptive methods. 7 Pockets

Learn about methods of contraception for men and women

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR NOTE

-  You may need to adapt this activity to cover types of contraceptives available in your area.
- Explain that the group will now have the opportunity to learn about different contraceptive methods from a health professional. Invite the health professional to introduce themselves. Use the following box ('Contraceptive Methods Presentation by a Health Provider From Casa Materna') as your guide. If you will conduct the activity yourself, be sure you have adequately prepared by following the guidance listed in this session's Facilitator Notes section. Then, follow the steps provided here. Remember: Be sure not to answer any questions when you do not know! Instead, say that you will find out the answer by the next session or ask for a volunteer to find out the answer for the group. 1

CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS PRESENTATION BY A HEALTH PROVIDER FROM CASA MATERNA

Ask the health professional to give a presentation on the different forms of contraceptive methods. The health professional should explain to the group the different types of contraceptives that are available in the community, including:

-  Hormonal contraceptives
-  Intrauterine devices (IUDs)
-  Barrier methods
-  Rhythm method (e.g., using cycle beads)
-  Vasectomy and tubal ligation

The health provider's presentation should include information on each method, how it is used, and how it prevents pregnancy, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of different methods; they should also provide the opportunity for participants to ask any questions they may have regarding different methods, including side effects. The health provider can also give information on sexual hygiene and answer any questions that couples have regarding sex and hygiene.

After the health provider has presented and the participants have asked all of their questions, open the discussion using the group discussion questions.

'Female Reproductive Anatomy' illustration, samples of actual contraceptive

<!-- image -->

- Explain that contraceptive methods can be divided into two categories: short-term methods and long-term, reversible methods. If available, use illustrations of the contraceptive methods to explain what each method looks like and how it works. You can also draw them on a flipchart paper. 2
- Explain that short-term methods are good options for many people because they: 3
-  Can be started and stopped quickly
-  Are also easy to access at health care facilities, at pharmacies, and from community health workers
- Point out that short-term methods must be used correctly to work effectively. 4
- Summarize some common short-term contraceptive methods: 5
-  Male and Female Condoms: This is a rubber sheath that a man puts over his erect penis or a woman inserts into her vagina just before having sex. Condoms prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections if they are used every time the woman/man has sex.
-  Contraceptive Pills: These pills contain one or more hormones that prevent ovulation. If you do not ovulate, you cannot get pregnant. You have to take one pill a day for the method to be effective.
-  Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECPs): These are pills that help a woman avoid pregnancy after she has had sex without contraception. ECPs help to prevent pregnancy when taken up to five days after unprotected sex.
-  Injectables: These are shots that a woman can get either once a month or once every three months. They usually contain one hormone that prevents ovulation and, thus, pregnancy.

Mention that long-acting, reversible methods are also good options because:

-  They prevent pregnancy for a longer period of time than short-term methods do.
-  Once inserted, they are low-maintenance. Women do not have to remember to do anything or make frequent visits to the health center or pharmacy.
-  Women need to go to a health facility to have the method inserted and, when ready, removed.
-  They can be used for up to several years but can be removed at any time by a health care provider if the woman wants to switch methods or become pregnant.
- Summarize some common long-acting, reversible methods: 7
-  Implants: These are small, flexible rods that are inserted just under the skin of the woman's upper arm. The rods release hormones that prevent ovulation for several years. These need to be inserted and removed by a trained health care provider. There are different kinds of implants. A woman should discuss the best options with a trained health care provider.
-  Intrauterine Device (IUD): This small, flexible, T-shaped piece is inserted into the woman's uterus by a trained health care provider at a health facility.
- Mention that there are also permanent methods of contraception for both men and women, such as sterilization, but these are only appropriate for people who are sure they are done having children. For men, having a vasectomy entails minor, very low-risk surgery that is highly effective and has no negative consequences for a man's sex drive or ability to enjoy sex. 8

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Point out the following and then go to the group discussion questions:
-  Every contraceptive method has advantages and disadvantages, so certain methods are best for different people.
-  It is very important that a couple talks to a health care provider to help them determine which method is best not only for the couple but also for the woman's body, health status, and lifestyle.
- Who usually has to think about or worry about contraception - the man or the woman? Why?
- How should a couple choose a contraceptive method to use that is right for them?
- What are some of the reasons why couples do not use family planning?
- Do you worry about side effects?
- Have you ever discussed family planning or birth spacing as a couple before? Why or why not?

148

<!-- image -->

## PURPOSE

Have a couples-based discussion about what contraceptive method may work best for their relationships

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Ensure the team facilitator participates in the dialogue to foster participation and trust; ask guests to bring materials with illustrations that can be used as presentations in this session (e.g., posters, brochures), examples of the contraceptives themselves if possible

- Ask participants to get into their pairs (spouses/partners) and find a quiet space to sit together where they feel comfortable and free to speak privately. If you feel that some couples may feel too self-conscious to have this conversation, encourage them to think about the questions in the next step for themselves and then facilitate the group discussion. 1
- Tell the pairs to discuss the following using the communication skills they've learned: 2
-  What method(s) are they currently using now? How was that method decided on?
-  If they are not using contraception, what might be the reasons for this?
-  Based on what they learned in the session, what (other) contraceptive methods might be right for them and why?
-  If they do not know which method might be right, which methods do they want to know more about?
-  What measures can they take now on where to find more information?
- Ask the couples to come back to the group. Ask them how they felt as they were speaking with one another. Thank participants for sharing. 3
- Share where they can get more information about the contraceptive methods discussed in today's session. Be sure to include the name of the health center, clinic, or hospital; what services it can provide; and its opening hours. If possible, pass out pamphlets or pre-prepared notecards with information. If you know of a doctor or health provider that is particularly friendly, share their name and contact information with the group. 4

<!-- image -->

KEY MESSAGES

<!-- image -->

Written information (e.g., pamphlets, business cards) on the nearest good-quality health center to access sexual and reproductive health services

<!-- image -->

-  It is both women's and men's responsibility to seek information to avoid unwanted pregnancy.
-  There are different contraceptive methods that couples can use to plan and space births.
-  It is important for couples to talk with a health professional, and with each other, when deciding which method to use.

<!-- image -->

## ACTIVITY 4.

## Check-Out and Weekly Commitment

- Explain that the session is ending, and thank everyone for their participation. 1
- Ask the group: 2
-  'Do you have any questions about the session?'
-  'Did you learn something today that will be useful in your own life? If so, what is it?'
- After finishing the questions, share the weekly commitment and confirm the time, date, and place of the next session. 3

## WEEKLY COMMITMENT

Explain that the weekly commitment assignment for this session is to continue the discussion about family planning with your partner: When you go home, sit down together and discuss your plans for having (or not having) more children. Do you plan to have more children, or would you rather not have any more? Remember that this is an important decision, and you need to consider carefully what having another child will mean for your and your children's lives. (Think about the pros and cons to help you decide whether you want to have another child or not.) If you want to have more children, do you want to space the births? What methods can you use, or are you using, to avoid unwanted pregnancy? At the next session, you can share how you felt while having this discussion: Was it easy or hard? Was it helpful?

Men and women separately

-  Recognize the different forms violence can take, learn about the local laws and policies around violence against women, and discuss the role power plays in violence
-  Identify the different types of violence that occur within families and communities
-  Markers
-  Flipchart
-  Tape
-  'Types of Violence' illustrations

## 2 hours

-  Check-In (15 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 1: What Is Violence? (45 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 2: What Does the Law Say? (45 MINUTES)
-  Check-Out and Weekly Commitment (15 MINUTES)
- Know the appropriate local networks in your area that provide services related to violence against women. Have printed copies of the name(s) and phone number(s) of the organization(s).
-  Be sure to consult Global Communities' Referral protocol (see Annex on page 180) regarding how to support a person who discloses violence without putting them in greater danger. Be aware that in some cases, you may be required to report any case of violence that is brought to your attention.
-  If someone discloses violence against women, determine if there is an imminent risk of violence present. Say there are specialized services in the community to support women experiencing violence, and ask if they would like to be referred to the appropriate organization. If they are interested, provide them with the appropriate information and assure them that it does not contain any references to the organization's services related to violence against women that could place them at risk.

ADAPTATION NOTES FOR WE GROUPS:

-  Discussing violence, especially violence that someone has personally experienced, can be very difficult. It is recommended to end the session with a fun, light energizer (e.g., a song) to help the participants smile and relax. It is also important to ensure that participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences - as perpetrators, witnesses, or victims of violence. Be clear that the group is not here to judge or condemn anyone, but is here to help support each other to move away from histories of violence.
-  The activity 'What Does the Law Say?' should be facilitated, or co-facilitated, by an expert who is knowledgeable on the country's laws and policies related to violence against women. This can be a police officer or a representative of the district authorities. Invite this person to participate in the session and provide him or her with an outline of the information you would like participants to receive. Invite the expert to participate only in the last part of the session, and not in the first two activities, to ensure the privacy of the personal stories shared during the session.
-  At the end of this session, participants should have the following knowledge:
-  What these laws say and what they mean for men, women, and their families
-  How to comply with these laws
-  Where and how to seek justice
-  What justice structures are present in the community
-  Again, be sure to end this sensitive session on a positive note by doing a fun energizer!
-  Take care of yourself after this session. Discussing sensitive topics such as violence against women can trigger indirect traumatic responses, painful personal memories, and other issues. Be sure to discuss with your supervisor any support you may need after this session is over, such as an in-person or phone debrief, time off, or other support.
-  If someone from the group reports to you that they are experiencing violence in their relationship, it is crucial that they receive a caring and supportive response. It is important to believe them, validate their feelings, ask them how they would like to be supported, and acknowledge your limitations (e.g., you may not know where they can go) and any limits to confidentiality (i.e., you may be required to report if they disclose a case of violence). If they wish to report to the appropriate authorities, follow the steps outlined in the program's GC referral protocol (see Section 8 at the beginning of the manual, 'Responding to Disclosures Related to Intimate Partner Violence or Mental Health' and the facilitator notes at the beginning of this session). If they wish to speak to someone professionally, provide them with a place where they can receive services from trained professionals. You are not a counselor or someone who can solve their problems, even though you will want to. Listen empathetically and refer them to professionals who can provide them with the best care.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Thank all of the participants for coming to the session. 1
- After a quick energizer, lead a check-in by asking a few volunteers from the group: 2
-  'How are you?'
-  'Has anything new happened since the last session?'
-  After reminding participants of the key messages from Session 10 (listed at the end of the session), 'Did you talk to anyone about what we discussed in the group? If so, what did you share?'
- Explain to the group that this is also the time for them to give feedback on their weekly commitment assignment. Ask the group: 3
-  'How did it go?'
-  'How did you feel after doing the assignment?'
-  'What was the result of the assignment?'
- Share personal insights from the last session that you had as a facilitator, such as anything that you learned or that surprised you about what was discussed. 4
- Tell the group the core purpose of today's session (included in the session's introduction). For the group with men, add that this session can be sensitive because we do not often talk about men's violence against women, often believing it is a private or taboo issue. Many men in this group may have also witnessed violence against their mother as a child, and such discussions may bring up painful memories. However, this topic is important because it allows men to explore why men use violence against women and how to prevent it from happening in their own homes and to those they care about. 5

FACILITATOR NOTES

-  Be sure to have Global Communities' referrals protocol on how to respond on hand, as well as printed copies of specialized support service (health, legal, and psychosocial) provided by Global Communities with addresses and phone numbers, making sure these copies do not contain any reference to the services related to violence against women they provide, to give to everyone at the end of the session.

Identify the different types of violence that occur within families and communities

<!-- image -->

Flipchart, markers, tape, 'Types of Violence' illustrations

- Ask the group, 'What is violence?' Allow them to share their opinions. ( Optional: You can write down the responses from the participants on a flipchart paper if you prefer.) 1

## FACILITATOR NOTE

-  If people identify general types of violence (such as 'physical'), ask them for specific examples of this.
- After everyone has shared their ideas, explain to the group: 2

'At its simplest level, violence is the use of force or the threat of force by one individual against another. Violence is not a random act. It happens in specific circumstances and settings. Violence happens more frequently in some settings than in others, such as during conflict, but it is also very present in our homes and communities. Violence often occurs within the family and is often perpetrated by men against women, although this is not the only type of violence.'

- Using the illustrations provided, tell the group that acts of violence can be divided into four broad categories: 3

## FACILITATOR NOTE

-  Try and link the four types of violence to the explanations or examples of violence that participants gave during the opening discussion.

<!-- image -->

PHYSICAL VIOLENCE: This involves using physical force, such as hitting, slapping, kicking, burning, or pushing.

<!-- image -->

EMOTIONAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL VIOLENCE: This is often the most difficult form of violence to identify. It may include humiliating, threatening, insulting, pressuring, and expressing jealousy or possessiveness, such as controlling decisions and activities. It can also include restricting someone's movements. This form of violence can be verbal or nonverbal.

<!-- image -->

SEXUAL VIOLENCE: This involves pressuring or forcing someone to perform sexual acts (from kissing to sex) against their will or making sexual comments that make someone feel humiliated or uncomfortable. It does not matter if the person has previously consented to sexual behavior - consent must be given at the time.

<!-- image -->

ECONOMIC VIOLENCE: This is when someone exercises complete control over another person's money and other economic resources. This type of violence is a way of exerting power and can be used to control someone's movements (for example, keeping them from meeting friends).

<!-- image -->

156

<!-- image -->

- Ask the group: 4
-  'Can anyone give an example of physical violence that is common in the community?'
-  'Can anyone give an example of psychological violence that is common in the community?'
-  'Can anyone give an example of sexual violence that is common in the community?'
-  'Can anyone give an example of economic violence that is common in the community?'
- After the examples have been given, start a discussion using the group discussion questions. 5

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

<!-- image -->

## FACILITATOR NOTE

## KEY MESSAGES

-  What are the most common types of violence that occur in the family? In romantic relationships? Between friends?
- What is the most common type of violence used against men? Women?
-  It is important that participants understand that both men and women use violence. However, it is important that the conversation not be sidetracked by discussions of women's violence against men. As the facilitator, you can explain to the group that while there are cases of women perpetrating violence against men, the overwhelming majority of violence in your country (and worldwide) is perpetrated by men against women. If the conversation becomes stuck on this issue, try and move the discussion along by asking another question.
-  What are the common factors that provoke violence against women? What does this have to do with the 'Man Box' and 'Woman Box'?
-  Do you think there is a relationship between power and violence? (Encourage the participants to think of the different types of power - economic, physical, and so on that a person can have over another and links to violence.)
-  What have you learned in this activity? Have you learned anything that can be applied in your own life and relationships?
-  At its most basic level, violence is a way to control or have power over another person. People often only think about violence as physical aggression, but there are other forms of violence as well.
-  Most often, this violence is targeted toward individuals or groups that are more vulnerable or marginalized in our communities.
-  Violence is a violation of a person's human rights, whether enacted against women, men, or children.

<!-- image -->

## ACTIVITY 2.

## What Does the Law Say?

## PURPOSE

Learn about the local laws and policies around violence against women, and discuss how power plays a role in violence

<!-- image -->

## MATERIALS

- 'Referral Pathway for Survivors of Violence' illustration (make sure you include a referral pathway to legal, health, and psychosocial services for survivors of violence existing in the setting you are working in, as well as contact information of the different services in your locality)
- GC protocol for referrals for female victims of violence (you will need to make sure you understand what your role is and talk to your supervisor at GC about any questions you have about it)
- Example of a map of referral services to places where participants can seek help if they experience violence against women and report cases of violence if they wish. The map (list of services) that you will find in the annex is specific to Cuilco, Huehuetenango. This not only must be updated; at the beginning of the program, it is necessary to confirm the contact numbers are still correct and develop a list with the essential services of specialized care for survivors of violence against women (health, psychological, and legal) in each locality.
- Explain that today the group has a visiting expert who is going to help them to understand some of the laws and policies that exist in their setting related to gender-based violence and what these mean for men, women, and their families. 1
- Invite the police officer or other expert to introduce himself or herself to the group. 2
- Ask the group: 'Has anyone heard about the laws on violence against women?' 3
- Allow a few participants to share any existing knowledge they have about the laws and policies. 4

## FACILITATOR NOTE

-  Violence against women is addressed in the Guatemalan Criminal Code and the 2008 femicide law, which criminalizes murder motivated by gender and establishes penalties of five to eight years for physical, economic, and psychological violence committed against women because of their gender. 22

22. Ley contral el femicidio y otras formas de violencia contra la mujer [Law Against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence Against Women], Decreto del Congreso [Congressional decree] No. 22-2008. (2008). http://www.oas.org/dil/esp/Ley\_contra\_el\_Femicidio\_y\_otras\_Formas\_de\_Violencia\_Contra\_la\_Mujer\_ Guatemala.pdf

<!-- image -->

- Invite the expert to provide information on the different laws and policies related to violence against women. Explain that the expert has approximately 30 minutes to provide this information. 5
- After the expert has presented, ask the group if they have any questions. Allow time for the expert to answer any questions the group may have. 6
- Once the expert has finished answering the group's questions, thank him or her for coming to the group. Once the expert has left the meeting, open the discussion using the group discussion questions. 7

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

- Are the laws and policies clear? Why or why not?
- What did you learn as you were listening?
- Why might some men feel threatened by laws that punish violence against women?
- Do you think people in your community understand these laws and policies? Why or why not?
- How do you imagine implementation of the laws will affect your family or your community?
- Why are laws like this important?
- How can laws like this be improved?
-  Laws to combat violence against women are not designed to give any one person or group power over another. They are designed to give all citizens equal rights to experience a life without violence.
-  Knowing the laws and policies that exist is the first step to accessing your own rights and to ensuring that you are also upholding the rights of others.
-  There is a referral pathway that any survivor of violence against women can use to get help specialized services to support their health and psychological well-being and to receive legal advice and information. For example, in Guatemala, people can go to the health center, the Municipal Directorate of Women, the Public Ministry, or the local police station, where they will be provided with information and referred to health, legal, and other support services that women or other people who are suffering violence in their home may need.

<!-- image -->

## ACTIVITY 3.

## Check-Out and Weekly Commitment

- Explain that the session is ending, and thank the group members for their participation. Tell the group that today was a very emotional and powerful session, and so the session will end with an activity rather than the usual check-out. 1
- Explain to the group that this exercise is designed to help the participants reflect on their experiences and the connections they have made with each other during this session. 2
- Ask the participants to stand in a circle, shoulder to shoulder. 3
- Explain that each participant is going to have the opportunity share one thing they are grateful for about the group and one thing that they learned that they will take with them back to their family. Each person will say the following statements: 4
-  'Something I am grateful for about this group is…'
-  'One thing I have learned today is…'
- After everyone has shared, ask the group members to look around at the men or women standing in the circle with them and to appreciate all that they have shared and experienced together. 5
- Explain that there is an invisible web connecting them, which represents the sum of their experiences in this group. 6
- Close the activity by saying: 7

'Now, we have the opportunity to take what we have learned and practiced together and share it with our family and friends. The changes we made inside ourselves are like a drop of rain on the surface of the water, creating ripples that affect everyone around us.'

- After finishing the closing circle, do a quick and fun energizer to end on a positive note. 8
- Share the weekly commitment and confirm the time, date, and place of the next session. The next session will be for men only. 9
- As participants leave, give everyone a copy of the violence against women referral sheet to take home. 10

## WEEKLY COMMITMENT

Explain that the weekly commitment assignment for this session is to share something new you learned during the session with a friend or neighbor. Think about someone you know who you think would benefit from having this information and start a discussion about what you learned. As the next session is only for men, the men should come prepared to share the results of their discussion with the group.

-  Notecards
-  Printed copies of the list of resources/referrals where individuals can go to report incidents of violence
- 2 hours
-  Check-In (15 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 1: Violence Clothesline (45 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 2: What Can I Do When I'm Angry? (45 MINUTES)
-  Check-Out and Weekly Commitment (15 MINUTES)

## FACILITATOR NOTES

-  Review the Facilitator Notes outlined in Session 11.
-  Encourage men to think about how they can break the cycle of violence, such as increasing trust between partners and communicating more. These are both actions that one partner can begin but require participation from both partners in order to work. Another action is that the partner who is using violence must choose to stop using violence.
-  Encourage men to talk about their feelings and think of ways that they can do this at home with their partners as well. Support them in thinking of the benefits that reacting in positive ways can actually bring.

## ACTIVITY 1.

## The Violence Clothesline 23

## PURPOSE

Provide a safe space where men can reflect on the cycles of violence that affect them, including how men use violence against others; discuss the factors that contribute to men's use of violence

## MATERIALS

ACTIVITY 2.

## What Do I Do When I'm Angry? 24

## PURPOSE

Reflect on how better to manage difficult emotions, such as anger, which often lead to violence; practice positive ways of managing emotions to end the use of violence

<!-- image -->

None

- Explain that the purpose of this activity is to think about how men can break the cycle of violence and ways that men can react when they are angry that are not violent or destructive. 1
- Tell the group that sometimes when we have a conflict with others or we are upset about something, it can provoke anger. Explain that: 2
-  Many of us confuse anger and violence, thinking that they are the same thing.
-  Anger is a natural and normal emotion that every human being feels at some point in life, especially with one's partner. .
-  Violence is a behavior that is sometimes used as a way to express anger.
- Ask the group, 'What are some of your triggers that can make you angry or lead to conflict with your partner?' 3
- Allow the participants to share some of the triggers or issues that can cause them to become angry. 4
- Tell the group that sometimes, when men are angry, they decide to use violence against their partner or their children on the basis that they have 'misbehaved, ' 'disobeyed, ' or 'disrespected' them or have behaved in ways that contravene expected gender roles and relations. These justifications are rooted in shared social ideas about what it means to be a man and how men and women should behave. (Remember the 'Man Box' and Woman Box'?) There are many other ways, however, to deal with our anger instead of using violence, including positive ways. Explain to the group that they will now talk about some of the different ways that men can react when they become angry. 5
- Ask participants to relax and close their eyes. Explain that you will ask them a series of questions, but they should only think silently and not respond out loud. 6
- Tell the group that money matters are often at the center of many disagreements within couples and can often lead to us being angry. Ask the group to think of a money-related situation or conflict that made them angry. 7
- Ask the group: 8
-  'What happened?' Give the group a few minutes to think silently.
-   'What were you thinking and feeling in this situation?'

- Tell the group: 9

'Very often, after we feel angry, we begin to react with violence. This can happen even before we realize that we are angry. Some men (and women) react immediately: shouting, throwing something on the floor, hitting something or someone. Sometimes, we can even become depressed and silent. Think about the incident during which you felt angry. How did you demonstrate this anger? How did you behave?'

- Explain that you will now divide the participants into groups of four or five people each (maximum). . 10
- Tell the groups that they are going to have 20 minutes to share their reflections about a time they were angry within their small groups. The groups should discuss: 11
-  What was the situation that made them angry?
-  How did they feel? What did they think?
-  How did they react to their anger?
- After 20 minutes, ask everyone to come back to the circle and ask the group:
-  'What are some of the negative methods that we sometimes use to deal with our anger?
-  'What are some of the positive ways that we can respond when we are angry?'
- It is likely that some of the following examples will be given. If not, you may share some of these examples with the group. 13

ex.

- 12

## EXAMPLES OF POSITIVE WAYS OF RESPONDING WHEN WE ARE ANGRY

-  (1) getting some fresh air or counting to ten; and (2) using words to express what we feel without offending. It is important to stress that 'getting some fresh air' does not mean going out to a bar and drinking lots of alcohol or getting in a vehicle and driving around at high speed, exposing oneself to risk.
-  Getting some fresh air is simply getting out of the situation of conflict, and away from the person who is making you angry. You can count to ten, breathe deeply, take a walk, or do some kind of physical activity, trying to cool down and keep calm. You should also explain to the other person that you will go outside to get some fresh air because you are feeling angry.
-  Using words without offending or harming is learning how to express two things: (1) saying to the other person why you are upset; and (2) saying what you want from the other person without offending or insulting. insultar.

## Tell the group: 14

'It is important to learn how to express our anger rather than bottling it up inside. When we allow anger to build up, we tend to explode. Healthier, more positive ways of reacting and expressing our anger can also lead to better results or ensuring everyone 'gets what they want.' By identifying the triggers that can cause us to become angry, and by thinking of new, positive ways to manage our anger, we can break the cycle the violence.'

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

<!-- image -->

## KEY MESSAGES

## Next, open up the discussion by using the group discussion questions.

- When discussing money matters or other household issues, is it difficult for men and women to express their anger without using violence? Why?
- Very often, we know how to avoid a conflict or a fight without using violence, but we don't do so. Why?
- Is it possible to get some fresh air or count to ten to reduce conflicts and tension? Do we have experience with this? How did it work out?
- Is it possible to use words without offending, especially when making household decisions? How?
- Do you think these positive ways of reacting when you are angry are realistic for you to use in your own life? Why or why not?
- Can you think of other positive ways of reacting when you are angry that are more realistic?
- Did you learn anything in this activity?
-  We have a responsibility to control ourselves when we feel angry or upset. It is important to learn how to express our anger rather than bottle it up inside.
-  When we allow anger to build up, we tend to explode.
-  Healthier, more positive ways of reacting and expressing our anger can also lead to better results or ensuring everyone 'gets what they want.'

## ACTIVITY 3.

## Check-Out and Weekly Commitment

- Explain that the session is ending and thank everyone for their participation. 1
- Ask the group: 2
-  'Do you have any questions about the session?'
-  'Did you learn something today that will be useful in your own life? If so, what is it?'
- After finishing the questions, share the weekly commitment and confirm the time, date, and place of the next session. 3

<!-- image -->

## WEEKLY COMMITMENT

## OPTIONAL ACTIVITY

As the next session will be the last, ask participants to bring their family visions. This will be a celebratory session, so they should also feel welcome to bring other family members to share what they have accomplished in the time together.

Explain that the weekly commitment assignment for this session is to try using one of the methods we discussed to control your anger. If a situation arises where you find yourself upset, try to talk through it calmly with the other person or seek out a friend for advice.

Explain to participants that in addition to the weekly commitment on anger management, they can also think about the important relationships in their lives and the people they can turn to for support or advice when they face a problem once the Dialogue Clubs have finished (in preparation for Activity #2, 'Our Support Network,' in Session 13). Ask them to draw their own support network on a notecard if possible (with drawings, graphics, or text) so they can make a presentation in the next session. Propose this as an activity they can do together with the family.

Men and women together

-  Celebrate the changes and reflect on what has been learned
-  Identify who makes up our social support network and when they can be called upon when we are facing challenges
-  Family visions
-  Copies of the 'Support Network' worksheet (in the session appendix)
-  Pens/pencils

2 hours

-  Check-In (15 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 1: Creating a Happy Life Together (45 MINUTES)
-  ACTIVITY 2: Our Support Network (30 MINUTES)
-  Closing Remarks (15 MINUTES)
-  Activity #2 of this session is to help couples identify support networks they can call on when they are facing problems related to issues such as parenting, health and welfare, and economic challenges. It is not an activity for women to identify the support network they can call on if they are experiencing violence or threats of violence from their partner, other family member(s), or more generally in society. The activity can be adapted for that purpose, however, and used, when needed, in women-only sessions to maximize women's security and comfort.

-  Invite a supportive community leader to give closing remarks and highlight the important changes the group has experienced in their lives and relationships. They should also provide words of encouragement for couples to continue working together and reaching out when they need support. Consider inviting guests who are not from the community (for example, a GC representative, someone from the Municipal Directorate of Women, and key community leaders).
-  Encourage participants to continue meeting and providing support to one another. This will help them to fulfill their commitments to the group and serve as a source of emotional support in difficult moments. Give participants time to exchange contact information, such as mobile phone numbers.
-  If possible, prepare graduation certificates to give to the Dialogue Club members. They have met over a period of several months, and it's likely that have become very close and attached. The certificates are a recognition of how far they have progressed in their processes of change!

- Thank all of the participants for coming to the last session. 1
- After an energizer, ask them to pair up in couples and to reflect on the family visions that they created and revisited during their Dialogue Club meetings: 2
-  Now that they are at the end of the sessions, do they feel that they are closer to achieving the family vision? Why or why not?
-  How has the family vision changed, if at all?
- Explain that in this last session, the participants will reflect on what they have learned during the Dialogue Clubs and some of the positive changes they have made to their lives and their relationships. 3

ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF CONDUCTING THIS FINAL SHARING ACTIVITY

2

FACILITATOR NOTE

Tell the group:

'Over the previous 12 sessions, each of us has learned from everyone else and grown in many ways. All of you have made a commitment to making positive changes in your lives and relationships, including working together for the betterment of your household. Change is a gradual process. It is important to take time to appreciate the changes we have made and to commit ourselves to continuing this process of positive change.'

-  Give each couple a flipchart paper and colorful markers. Have them illustrate with pictures the journey they've been on together since they joined the Dialogue Clubs. Have them present their drawings to the larger group. Tape all the drawings to the wall and take a photo with all participants in front of their drawings.
- Be aware of COVID restrictions! Do a Spider's Web with a piece of long string or yarn. As the facilitator, hold one end of the yarn and describe one thing you will take away (something you have learned, enjoyed, or changed your mind about) from the sessions. After you have finished, pass on the other end of the yarn or rope to another person in the circle while holding onto the first part of the yarn. After the next person shares, they should hold onto the end they were passed and pass the other end to the next person. Continue until everyone has shared and claimed a part of the yarn. In the end, a web should have formed. Share some final words of appreciation and recognition. Cut the pieces of yarn and make them into bracelets for everyone to take home.
- Consider other creative ways participants can reflect on their learning and progress in the Dialogue Clubs.
- Explain that each man and woman will have the opportunity to share with the group what they have learned and how they have changed as a result of participating in the group sessions.
-  If the group is very large, this can be done in smaller groups (ensuring that couples are together in the same group).

- Ask a couple to volunteer to go first. Explain that each couple will have five minutes to share. They can decide what they would like to share with the group, but that it can include: 3
-  What personal changes you made in your life
-  How your family and community have been involved in your change
-  What personal rewards you have you seen
-  What you hope to change in the future
-  What you enjoyed in this group
- Ask for another volunteer couple and continue until everyone who would like to share has had time to do so. 4
- After everyone has shared their stories, ask if any of the participants would like to provide feedback to those who have shared their stories. These should be words of encouragement and support. 5
- After any feedback has been provided, thank everyone for sharing and congratulate everyone on the important changes and steps they have made in their lives. 6

## ACTIVITY 2.

## Our Support Network

## PURPOSE

Identify who makes up our social support network and when they can be called upon when we are facing challenges

<!-- image -->

Copies of the 'Support Network' worksheet in the appendix of this session, pens/pencils

- Explain to the participants that you are going to do a final activity as couples that will make them think about the important relationships in their lives and the people they can turn to for support or advice when they are facing a problem as a couple once they leave the Dialogue Clubs. Thinking about the previous activity, how can we build a network to help sustain the changes we've made? 1
- Tell participants that they will work together with their spouse/partner during this exercise. Give each couple a copy of the 'Support Network' worksheet and a pen or pencil. Tell them to think about the people they turn to for advice when they have a problem as a couple. 2
- Tell the participants they should put themselves, as a couple, at the center of the circle. In the circles around the center they should write the names of those they can rely on for support or advice. The people they can rely on the most should be in the rings/circles closest to the center. Those who provide less support or advice should be placed in the outer rings/circles. Tell the participants that 'support' can be either advice or counseling and could even be support with health or money matters. 3
- Give the couples 10 to 15 minutes to complete their worksheets. After 10 to 15 minutes, ask if any of the couples would like to share their social support network with the whole group. After some couples have shared their networks, open the discussion using the group discussion questions. 4
- Allow couples (those who want to) to share the support network graphic they created at home. Then, identify a good place to post all the couples' support network illustrations and family visions to create a community mural. Walk around, looking at the mural and thanking everyone for the effort and dedication, and tell them that they can place these support network graphics in a visible place in their homes. 5
- Was it easy or difficult to identify the people you can rely on for help and support?
- In what ways do these individuals and networks help you as a couple? What advice do they provide?
- How can we provide the same type of support we hope to get from others?
- What can we do to strengthen our social support networks?

<!-- image -->

## GROUP DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- CONGRATULATE EVERYONE IN THE GROUP FOR COMING SO FAR! Say that you are proud to have participated in this important moment in their lives and relationships. Remind them that change does not happen all at once, but rather takes time. Relationships are a constant work in progress, which is part of the fun. Thank them for trusting you with their stories and experiences.
-  At this point, you can invite a community leader to come and say a few closing remarks to close the Dialogue Club. That person should say a few words about the importance of continuing the process of change in these groups and how proud they are of how the participants are helping make their community a more peaceful and prosperous place.
-  If certificates are available, hand out the certificates to each person in the group with the invited community leader.

## Energizer Examples

## Spaghetti

( THIS ENERGIZER IS FUN AND CREATES A NICE PHYSICAL BOND AMONG PARTICIPANTS. IT ALSO SUBTLY COMMUNICATES THE IDEA OF WORKING TOGETHER TO ACCOMPLISH A TASK. AS YOU PLAN, CONSIDER MAKING ADAPTATIONS IN LIGHT OF COVID-19 SOCIAL DISTANCING RESTRICTIONS.)

- Split participants into two or three groups with about five to ten people each. Have each group form a tight circle, with everyone sticking their hands into the center. With one hand, everyone should grab the hand of another person. Then, using the other hand, they should grab the hand of someone different. 1
- Explain that the object of the game is to get untangled without letting go. By climbing, crawling, and wriggling around, participants can create one large open circle or, sometimes, two unconnected ones. 2
- Have participants begin. If they are totally stuck, you can tell them they can chose to undo one link and then reconnect once that person has turned around, seeing if that works. 3

## The Rainstorm

( A PHYSICAL BUT CALMING EXERCISE THAT CAN BE USED AS A CLOSING ACTIVITY)

- Ask the group to stand in a circle with their eyes closed. 1
- Say that a rainstorm is approaching. 2
- Ask everyone to rub their palms on the legs of their pants. 3
- Then, ask them to lightly pat their thighs with their fingertips. 4
- Ask them to do it harder. Now, ask them to pat their hands against their thighs. 5
- Now, ask them to start slapping their hands faster and faster against their thighs. 6
- After a while, go back to lighter slapping, then patting, and so on, to reverse the whole order until it is quiet again and the storm has passed. 7

## Count Up

- Have the group stand in a close, huddled circle with their eyes closed. A variation is to have the group disperse around a room, standing, sitting, or lying down. 1
- Explain the rules: The goal is for the group to count to 20 (or the number of members in the group), keeping their eyes closed so they don't see who has spoken or is about to speak. Only one person may say one number at a time. If two people speak at the same time, even for the slightest moment, the group must start over at one. The group has succeeded when they have counted up to the set number. 2
- Begin the exercise, continuing until the group has succeeded. 3

## 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' Tournament

- Have participants each find a partner to play a game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' with. 1
- Instruct each pair's winner to find a new opponent, with the losing player becoming a fan of the winner. 2
- Have the winners play against their new opponents while their fans cheer for them. 3
- Continue in this manner: The winner of the second game searches for a new opponent, while the losing team joins the winner's fan base. 4
- Repeat until there are only two opponents, each with a huge fan base cheering for them. The last two will play until one player has won twice. 5

Ensure that you adapt the names of institutions and contact information of survivor centered service providers in your area.

## Referral Protocol for victims of violence (women and girls)*

ENSURE A SURVIVOR-CENTERED APPROACH. REFER SURVIVORS TO ESSENTIAL SERVICES, BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF RESPECT, SAFETY, CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCRIMINATION.

I F   A   WOMAN AND/OR GIRL CONFIDENTIALLY TELLS YOU ABOUT AN INCIDENT OF PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE, TAKE THE FOLLOWING MEASURES:

WHAT SHOULD I DO?

- Provide immediate emotional support. Listen to the victim and tell her that it is not her fault. Do not judge her. 1
- Do not ignore the survivor or her story, and do not cast doubt on it. 1
- Provide a safe environment for the survivor. Do not talk to the offender. 2
- Listen carefully, give the victim time to tell you what he/she wants to say. 3
- Remember that confidentiality is critical to the victim's safety. Do not share her personal information with friends, family or acquaintances. 4
- Respect the victim's right to decide for herself what action she wishes to take. 5
- The victim's safety is always paramount. 6
- Provide the survivor with information on the essential services available. 7
- Do not blame the survivor. 2
- Do not make choices for her. 3
- Do not, under any circumstances, offer advice or attempt to reconcile with the aggressor. 4
- Do not insist on meeting with her and/or her partner. 5
- Do not recommend couple therapy. 6
- Do not discriminate on any grounds including age, disability, religion, ethnicity, class, or sexual orientation. 7
- When children disclose acts of violence, do not ignore them (see below for specialized routes for them). 8
- Do not touch survivors (unless they want to be hugged or have their hand held). 9
- Stay calm, do not overreact. 10
- Do not take photographs of the survivor or call the media. 11
