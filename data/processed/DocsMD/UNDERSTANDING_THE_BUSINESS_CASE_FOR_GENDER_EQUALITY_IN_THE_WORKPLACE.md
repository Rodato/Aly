## I. INTRODUCTION: THE BUSINESS CASE FOR GENDER EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE AND IN SOCIETY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA (MENA)

The  Middle  East  and  North  Africa  (MENA)  region continues  to  witness  progress  -  driven  by  new Government  policies  and  civil  society  initiatives -  toward  the  greater  advancement  of  women's rights and equal opportunities for men and women alike. However, as in all regions of the world, there is  a  long  road  ahead  before  women  attain  true equality with men.

During  this  important  period  of  social  change  in the MENA region, UN Women, Promundo and their partners commissioned the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) in multiple locations, to compile a multi-country report published in 2017. 1 This first part of the study involved nearly 10,000  survey  male  and  female  respondents  in Egypt, Lebanon (where the sample included Syrian refugees),  Morocco 2 and  Palestine,  which  involved investigating  many  of  the  stereotypes  commonly associated with men, women, boys and girls in these countries  and  highlighting  pathways  to  equality, including,  importantly,  how  men  can  be  engaged and supportive partners and allies in achieving this goal.

This brief draws upon data and recommendations presented in the first IMAGES MENA multi-country report,  along  with  other  data  sources  and  case studies  from  the  region,  to  explore  the  business case for gender equality in the workplace. Although Governments  in  MENA  are  searching  for  new sources of economic growth, including job creation, innovation and increased competitiveness, 3  and despite investments in women's education, women's workforce  participation  in  MENA  still  lags  behind men's and continues to be some of the lowest in the world. 4 Many  factors  reinforce  these  inequalities: these include legal barriers that constrain women's rights  and  freedoms;  institutions  that  have  not yet embraced - in policy and practice - full gender equality;  and  social  expectations  about  what  it means to be a man or a woman, both at work and at home.

Using  a  variety  of  data  sources  and  UN  Women and  UN  Global  Compact  Women's  Empowerment Principles, 5 ,6  alongside in-depth case studies of two businesses  pursuing  new  gender  equality  policies in  Egypt  and  Palestine,  this  brief  aims  to  provide action-oriented  steps  and  guidance  on  how  business leaders - the vast majority of whom are male - with the support of civil society partners, United Nations key players, and Governments can implement  policies  and  programmes  and  bring  about a  change  in  corporate  cultures  to  achieve  greater gender equality in the workplace.

## II. ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF THE CASE FOR GENDER EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE AND SOCIETY

Advancing gender equality in the workplace through the implementation of promising policies and  protocols  could  provide  significant  positive benefits  for  employers,  employees  and  can  contribute  to  transforming  societies.  There  are  many reasons why gender equality should be prioritized in business.

Gender  equality  and  women's  equal  rights  are fundamental elements of thriving societies. Gender equality  in  all  spaces  -  the  social,  economic  and political realms- is a basic human right, a precondition for sustainable development and a provision in many international conventions (including, notably, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination  Against  Women 7 ).  Women  should have  equal  rights  and  access  to  professional  development  opportunities,  decent  work  and  career advancement  in  leadership  positions.  Workplaces free  from  gender-based  discrimination,  violence and  sexual  harassment  and  that  have  gender  responsive employment and social protection policies are basic requisites for an inclusive and sustainable socioeconomic future.

Gender equality in the workplace has far-reaching positive  economic  effects. In  addition  to  direct benefits  for  employees  and  their  families,  better economic  opportunities  for  women  can  lead  to economic  growth  (by  expanding  the  workforce, contributing  to  higher  levels  of  children's  school enrolment  and  driving  the  increased  purchase  of goods and services, including those that contribute to family well-being, such as food and medicine). 8,9

According to one study, MENA could have boosted its gross domestic product by $415 billion if it had reduced the gender gap in its workforce participation rates by 20 percentage points by 2017; another study estimates that gender gaps in employment and  entrepreneurship  are  equivalent  to  a  total income  loss  for  the  region  of  35  per  cent  in  the short-term and 38 per cent in the long-term. 10

Women's participation at all levels of business will provide benefits. Providing equal opportunities for women in the workplace will lead to a diversification and capitalization of an untapped talent pool, which is a result of the significant investment made in women's educational advancement in the region in  recent  decades.  There  is  also  evidence  of  the positive  impacts  of  women's  participation  at  the highest levels of business: women's leadership - for instance, in the form of participation on boards and in senior management - has been shown, in certain cases, to improve a company's ability to serve consumer markets dominated by women, 11,12  to provide a wider range of perspectives and decision-making styles, 13,14,15 and  to  reduce high-risk financial transactions. 16 Expanding  roles  for  women  is  only  one component of creating a more diverse workforce, and increasing opportunities for members of racial, ethnic minority and other marginalized groups can also lead to similar benefits.

Gender  equality  in  the  workplace  can  help  boost a  company's  profitability. Policies  which  support equal  opportunities  and  treatment  for  men  and women can  lead  to  cost  savings  as  the  result  of increased retention and reduced turnover, in part due  to  satisfaction  from  an  environment  that  is free from harassment and is supportive of work-life balance: a need that persists more strongly in the private than in the public sector. 17  While companies reap substantial benefits when women participate equally  in  the  workforce,  this  will  not  become  a reality  without  supportive  policies  and  protocols within  business,  the  Government  and  other  key sectors.

Gender equality in the workplace is also a positive factor  for  men. Often  corporations  that  take  the needs of women seriously also make the workplace better for men. For example, offering policies, such as parental leave that is equal, well-paid and nontransferable for all caregivers, may not only lead to better pay and greater advancement for women in the  workforce,  but  may  also  increase  men's  connectedness at home. 18  Evidence suggests that men also  experience  more  life  satisfaction,  happiness, better health and mental health and may be more productive  at  work  when  they  participate  more fully  in  caregiving. 19   When  companies  promote everyone's roles as income-earners and caregivers, regardless of gender, they can help alleviate the unequal burden of care on women and also validate productive  identities  for  men  beyond  just  being financial providers to the benefit of all.

## III. THE STATE OF WOMEN'S ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES - AND MEN'S OPINIONS ON THE TOPIC IN THE MENA REGION

While the female labour force participation in the MENA region is very low compared to men's, and compared to other regions, it is rising faster than in any other region of the globe. 20 The  International Labour  Organization  (ILO)  estimates  that  only  27 per cent of working age women in the MENA region participate in the labour force, as compared to 77 per cent of men. 21 The disparities exist for young people as well: in Northern Africa and the Arab States, the ILO reports that the female youth unemployment rate  (which  is  as  high  as  44  per  cent)  is  almost double that of young men. 22  However, the story of the female labour force participation in the region is  neither static nor uniform. Labour force participation rates vary widely across the MENA region: World Bank data estimates rates as low as 15 per cent in Algeria, Iraq and Palestine, and as high as 50 per cent in Qatar (see the chart below). 23  And even as labour participation rates remain low, data suggest  that  they  are  increasing,  perhaps  even  more rapidly than elsewhere in the globe, rising from 21 per  cent  to  27  per  cent  between  1990  and  2015. 24 While globally, women often make up more of the informal  labor  market  (having  informal  working arrangements, often without legal or social protection) than men do, MENA is one of the two regions globally where this is not the case: 47 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women workers are in informal  employment,  meaning  that  women  have much less access to any kind of employment when compared to men. 25

The  share  of  management  positions,  chief  executive officer (CEO) positions and firm ownerships held by women is well below the percentage held by men, as well as by women in other regions. ILO data estimate that women in MENA hold up to only 15 per cent of private sector management positions, the lowest such rate in all regions in the world (see the  chart  below). 27 Likewise,  while  21  per  cent  of CEO positions are held by women in all participating 'developing countries,' only 13 per cent of CEO positions are held by women in the MENA region. 28 In  a  World  Bank  survey  of  eight  countries  in  the region, women were found to own less than 8 per cent of firms on average, significantly lower than the  rates  for  all  middle-income  or  lower-middleincome  Enterprise  Survey  economies  (although, it must be noted, in none of those economies did women own more than 16 per cent of firms). 29

Prevailing stereotypes related to gender - in particular, expectations of men as the financial provider and of women are homemakers - are a notable barrier to workplace  equality,  alongside  other  structural  factors. Some three-quarters or more of men across all four initial countries in the IMAGES MENA survey, for instance, agreed that when resources are scarce, men should have access to jobs before women do. Women also agreed, although the numbers were slightly  lower. 31 These  findings  reflect  those  from many other studies focusing on the region, including the World Values Survey, which allude to social barriers  that  may  prohibit  women  seeking  entry into the workforce. 32

Additionally, gender stereotypes can lead to discrimination  against  women  in  hiring,  emerging  from employers'  assumptions  that  marriage,  domestic work and family responsibilities would limit female employees'  productivity  or  focus  on  work. 33 This finding in particular emphasizes how social norms prioritizing  women's  roles  at  home  -  not  in  the workplace - continue to curtail women's economic opportunities in the region. Additional factors may contribute to women's lack of participation in the workforce: 34 firstly,  men  frequently  dominate  or control  household  decision-making  and  political and leadership spaces; secondly, the same applies to the daily lives of women and girls; and, thirdly, women also face high rates of sexual harassment in public spaces, workplaces and schools.

Furthermore, structural factors can also limit women's  participation  and  advancement  in  the workforce. These may include restrictions in terms of women's labor rights, access to state welfare services, finances (such as barriers to passing pensions

on  to  beneficiaries,  independently  applying  for loans), or related to infrastructure and transportation. 35  To create meaningful change, there must be a breakdown of stereotypes, harmful social norms, discriminatory  practices,  as  well  as  these  prohibitive structural factors. 36

## BOX 1 RESTRICTIONS ON WOMEN'S ROLES IN THE LABOUR FORCE ARE AT TIMES CODIFIED IN LAW

As explored in a forthcoming study by Musawah, it is not uncommon for legislation to  specifically  curtail  the  scope  of  women's economic  participation,  based  on  harmful stereotypes. 58  As the authors write, 'Women are  still  seen  as  vulnerable  beings  within society  who  need  to  be  protected,  or  are viewed  as  dependents  under  the  financial guardianship  of  their  husbands  or  fathers, and  not  regarded  as  independent  citizens.' Such legislation includes:

-  Laws that prevent women from working at night. Articles 81 and 82 of Oman's Labour Law of 2003, for instance, prohibit women from  working  between  the  hours  of  9:00 p.m.  and  6:00  a.m.,  with  exceptions  for certain  industries  or  'exceptional  circumstances'.  Egypt  has  a  similar  labour  law: Article  1,  Ministerial  Decree  183,  of  2003 prohibits women working night shifts in the industrial sector from 7:00 p.m. till 7:00 a.m.
-  Laws that prevent women from working in 'harmful'  or  'particularly  difficult'  jobs. Many countries explicitly prohibit women's employment in various sectors. For example, in the United Arab Emirates, women are prohibited from working in tanneries, bars, manufacturing, mining, welding, butchering, extraction and other jobs. 59

Yet, several emerging positive shifts are taking place across the region that point to a future where women and men alike could thrive in both professional and  domestic  roles,  regardless  of  their  gender .  A 2014 McKinsey survey found that some 60 per cent of respondents said the involvement of women in leadership  positions  is  a  very  important  driver  of organizational effectiveness, and some two thirds reported  that  women's  leadership  was  on  their organization's  strategic  agenda. 37 Close  to  half  of the men surveyed in IMAGES MENA believed that a  married  woman should have the same right to work as a man. Moreover, a majority of men in all four countries said that they would accept a woman as a boss, among other indications that they are willing to work in gender-integrated workplaces. 38 These signs are encouraging, even though they may be theoretical: IMAGES MENA findings tell us that many men in the region support women working outside  the  home  -  it  would  seem  only  as  long as  they  remain  the  primary  breadwinners,  while women remain the main caregivers and organizers of domestic life. It is hard to predict whether recent income-constraining  developments,  such  as  the downturn in oil prices affecting the Gulf States and the  currency  fluctuation  in  Egypt  and  elsewhere, factors  that  have  encouraged  women's  employment to supplement household income, will affect any of these trends.

## IV. SURVEY OF KEY POLICIES, PROTOCOLS AND STRATEGIES FOR GENDER-EQUITABLE WORKPLACES

There are several clear policies and strategic entry points  that  business  leaders,  alongside  alliances, National Governments, civil society organizations, United  Nations  entities,  local  activists  and  other parties in the MENA region, can invest in to create more  equal,  profitable  companies  and  prosperous  societies.  According  to  the  UN's  Women's Empowerment Principles, business leaders can play a key role (and engage additional internal and external stakeholders) in exhibiting high-level support for policies concerning gender equality and human rights,  and  in  establishing  related  company-wide goals and targets, as well as transparent systems of accountability. 39

Factors  that  influence  the  entry  points  and  success  of  the  strategies  are  both 1)  internal ,  factors existing within a work place or work space, which impact women's retention, satisfaction and/or career advancement; and 2) external , factors outside of  the  workplace,  that  prohibit  or  hinder  women from entering or staying in the workforce.

## 1 . INTERNAL FACTORS AND STRATEGIES:

a. Recruitment and hiring practices: Important measures to eliminate discrimination in recruitment and hiring - an essential element to promoting genderequitable workplaces - include expanding methods to  reach  and  appeal  to  more  women  candidates and  eliminating  sexist  language  in  job  advertisements  and  potentially  discriminatory  questions for  women  (e.g.  their  marital  status,  or  whether they have children, for example) in applications or interviews.  Establishing  connections  with  local  or regional  organizations  and  associations  that  promote  women's  advancement  is  another  effective way to recruit women and to publicly demonstrate commitment to gender-equitable workplaces. Additional strategies include evaluating candidates with clear and objective rubrics rather than subjective  and  potentially  biased  opinions;  developing minimum quotas for hiring female employees; explicitly encouraging women to apply for positions that are posted; requiring hiring panels to consist of an equal number of women and men; and developing affirmative action measures. 40  Increasing knowledge and capacities of human resources staff on  the  principles  of  fair  and  gender-sensitive  recruitment procedures and ensuring equal payment and  benefits  for  work  of  equal  value,  supported by explicit commitment from senior leaders in the company, are important steps to help realize these changes.

## BOX 2 WOMEN AND PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYMENT

Women  in  the  MENA  region  often  prefer employment in the public sector due to more favourable  conditions  than  in  private  sector  employment,  including  better  benefits, higher job security and more flexible working hours. In Egypt, around three-quarters of employees in the public sector are women, and in Morocco, women constitute half of public sector employees. 60 In Egypt and Jordan, evidence indicates that the majority of women employed in the private sector stop working after marriage, in contrast to those working in  the  public  sector. 61   Women who do work in the private sector are often concentrated in certain fields that are considered traditionally feminine, such as education, social work and  health  services.  Moreover,  women  account for the largest share of employment in education across the vast majority of MENA countries. 62

b. Family-friendly workplace policies 41 : A significant hindrance  to  women's  participation  in  the  workforce is a lack of family-friendly workplace policies, given the expectation that women will be primarily responsible for caring for the children and/or the elderly within the family. While leave policies should not just be left to employers and individuals - and should be Government-mandated, included within existing or new employment benefits, or social insurance - workplaces can play a key role in creating and implementing these policies. 42  Family-friendly policies  should  include  maternity,  paternity  and parental  leave,  as  well  as  flexible  working  hours and high-quality affordable childcare. While most countries  in  the  region  guarantee  some  maternity leave, ranging from four weeks in Tunisia to 15 weeks  in  Jordan, 43 paternity  leave  or  longer-term parental leave that includes both parents has yet to be adopted across the region, although some multinational companies do provide longer maternity leave, better maternity benefits, a short paternity leave and onsite childcare or subsidies for childcare expenses.

Parental  leave  and  innovative  childcare  policies that  help  promote  women's  advancement  opportunities at work are limited: most existing leave is unpaid. In addition, only three countries in the region guarantee women the same or an equivalent position after maternity leave. 44  Leave entitlement (maternity, paternity, and parental) that is equal, 45 well-paid,  and  non-transferable  would  encourage and support all  parents  to  be  responsible  for  the care  and  upbringing  of  their  children,  removing the  burden  from  women  as  sole  caretakers  and promoting  continued  employment  and  equal  opportunities for women's career advancement. 46

c.  Policies  prohibiting  sexual  harassment: Ensuring workplaces and public spaces that are free from any type of female harassment is also a key component to

promoting  women's  economic  empowerment.  Only one-fifth of countries in the MENA region have legislation prohibiting sexual harassment at work or in public places. Yet research shows that 40-60 per cent of women have experienced street harassment (less data is available on workplace sexual harassment). 47,48 Businesses  should  implement  policies  that  explicitly  condemn  sexual  harassment  in  the  workplace, provide gender-transformative, awareness-raising trainings for all staff and management and create an environment in which perpetrators are held accountable. Human resources procedures, such as systems for  filing  complaints  against  workplace  harassment and consequences for offenses, should be embedded in institutional policies and clearly communicated to all staff. As the following strategy emphasizes, businesses must consider women's safety both in public spaces and in the workplace.  As noted above, women too often experience harassment outside the workplace,  which  suggests  that  progressive  workplaces should also add their voices to efforts to end harassment against women in all spaces.

d.  Promotion  of  women  into  management  and executive  positions  (including  through  retention strategies): Although  some  progress  of  women  in management positions has occurred in the region, women  continue  to  experience  significant  barriers to advancement into leadership positions, due to internal workplace factors and external factors, such as opportunity-limiting legislation or access to safe transportation, as highlighted below). However, programmes and initiatives emphasizing the importance of gender balance in management are  accelerating  in  many  countries  in  the  region. Common  measures  supporting  women's  career advancement include the following: executive trainings; exposing women to all company operations and functions; ensuring senior management support  for  a  gender  equality  strategy;  making promotion systems and career advancement prospects clear and accessible for women; and quotas for  women,  both  in  senior  management  and  in executive  roles.  However,  these  initiatives  being implemented in the region are too limited in scope to  drive  adequate  change  and  contribute  to  economic growth. Less than 12 per cent of companies' employees interviewed in a 2013 ILO study reported prioritizing the implementation of retention strategies for women, or flexible and family-friendly work policies. 49

## BOX 3 EXAMPLES OF - AND OBSTACLES TO FAMILY-FRIENDLY MEASURES IN MENA BUSINESSES

Few  companies  are  institutionalizing  sufficient gender-sensitive or family-friendly measures, but some are implementing innovative and strategic policies and initiatives to promote  women's  economic  advancement. Less than 12 per cent of companies' employees interviewed in a 2013 ILO study reported prioritizing the implementation of retention strategies for women or flexible and familyfriendly work policies. 63

-  Under  the  Gender  Equality  Model  Egypt initiative  launched  by  the  Government in  partnership  with  the  United  Nations and other international organizations, 10 companies in Egypt implemented genderequality  trainings  and  gender-sensitive human  resource  policies  and  codes  of conduct, then they publicized their commitment  to the programme  on  their websites  and  in  their  print  materials. 64 One participating company, the Egyptian investment  bank,  the  Prime  Group,  instituted  a  company  code  of  ethics  and standard  of  conduct  that  explicitly  forbade harassment and discrimination, and recognized the outstanding performance of female employees. The female respondents to a survey of the effectiveness of these initiatives noted the additional benefits. 65
-  Chemical Industries Development, an Egyptian pharmaceutical company, prioritized gender equality by implementing actions that included subsidized childcare,  an  emphasis  on  equal  pay  for women and men, employee trainings on gender  equality  and  improved  recruitment procedures. 66

In  smaller  companies,  women's  advancement programmes are less common and, if offered,  are  often  due  to  informal  arrangements  rather  than  structured  policies.  For

example, results from a 2015 qualitative survey  on  recruitment  procedures  in  Lebanese companies  showed  that  most  employers preferred  to  hire  women  in  management positions  on  account  of  certain  perceived qualities they believed women to have, but had not established gender-sensitive human resources  programmes  to  support  women's advancement  to  senior  positions. 67   These one-off occurrences of grooming female managers  on  a  case-by-case  basis  do  not reflect  a  comprehensive  and  effective  approach,  which  should  include  professional development  opportunities,  such  as  coaching/mentoring programmes and clear pathways  to  advancement  into  leadership positions and gender-sensitive hiring procedures, trainings and family-friendly policies. Such programmes may seem irrelevant to the region's  many  small  family-run  businesses, but even these businesses can be places of discriminatory behaviours and practices and can  benefit  from  institutionalizing  gendersensitive measures.

- e.  Alliances,  organizations  and  professional  networks: Since  Arab  women  executives  assert  that exclusion  from  professional  networks  is  the  main barrier to career advancement, women in the region are increasingly organizing and networking. 50  Most countries in the MENA region now have more than one businesswomen's association to support female leadership  and  entrepreneurship.  Examples  include the MENA Businesswomen's Network Association in Bahrain,  the  Palestinian  Business  Women's  Forum, the National Association of Women Entrepreneurs of Tunisia, the Council of Arab Businesswomen and the MENA  Businesswomen's  Network.  These  networks provide  training,  research,  networking  opportunities and other services and support, both nationally and internationally. 51  Supporting these alliances and associations, including female colleagues and breaking  down  barriers  for  entry  into  male-dominated networks,  expanding  business  relationships  with women-owned enterprises (including small business and  entrepreneurs),  and/or  creating  online  portals for  women  to  help  promote  career  opportunities across the region are additional network-based strategies that businesses can implement.
- f.  Mandatory  trainings  on  gender,  diversity  and other topics: To mitigate barriers to  women's economic  advancement,  employers  can  institute gender-sensitive diversity trainings to improve work environments by raising awareness of the prevalent stereotyping, gender discrimination and social exclusion well described by women executives across the  region  in  a  study  by  Kuwait  University. 52 Such trainings should be gender-transformative: seeking to transform inequitable power dynamics between men and women directly and encouraging participants to reflect on gender stereotypes to achieve the truly gender-transformative norm change required in workplaces. These trainings, when complemented by formalized human resource policies, will also bolster equitable recruitment and hiring practices. Furthermore,  businesses  should  provide  all  employees  with  equal  access  to  company-supported education  and  training  programs  (which  may  include  literacy  classes,  vocational  and  information technology training), as well as formal and informal networking and mentoring. 53

## 2. EXTERNAL FACTORS AND STRATEGIES:

- a.  Laws  and  legislative  tools: Businesses  and  civil society activists should advocate for more gender-equitable policies and better implementation of those that already exist. While most countries in the region have adopted the principle of gender equality in their constitutions,  in  practice,  men  and  women  are  not always entitled to equal treatment and equal opportunities in the workplace. Nearly every country in the region has at least one restriction on women's work, many of which may be framed as protective of women, but in reality, placing limitations on their rights. 54 For  example,  many  labour  laws  include  restrictions for women in jobs that are considered hazardous or working hours that are perceived to be unacceptable for women, a fact that may further prevent employers from hiring women and restrict the opportunities women can pursue. Business leaders and civil society can also play a role in advocating for family-friendly workplace legislation (see item b. on page 10 for more detail).  Such  legislation  should  include  equal,  paid, non-transferable  leave  for  men  and  women,  which can  reduce  any  incentive  for  discrimination  against female applicants due to the presumption that they will take more leave than their male counterparts for the purposes of caregiving and parenthood.

b.  Accessible,  safe,  and  reliable  transportation: The lack of accessible, safe and reliable transportation is a significant constraint on women's ability to access employment, economic opportunities and resources. This  is  particularly  the  case  in  the  private  sector, where  employees  often  demonstrate  commitment by working overtime. Here women face barriers to career advancement because it is considered unsafe or  inappropriate for them to commute later in the evenings. These concerns can be exacerbated by conflict-related realities in some locations in the region. Business leaders can play a role in adjusting company policy so as to be understanding and accommodating of factors like the frequency of checkpoints and barriers.  For  example,  businesses  can  provide  their own safe transportation services, such as company buses, as many public-sector companies do in Egypt.

## V. CASE STUDIES OF BUSINESSES SEEKING GENDER EQUALITY IN EGYPT AND PALESTINE

As  part  of  the  background  research  for  this  brief, UN Women and Promundo commissioned in-depth qualitative research 55     of  two companies: Mansour Group 56   in Egypt and Bank of Palestine. These case studies  demonstrate  the  intentions  of  business leaders in the region to establish more gender-equal workplaces  and  professional  opportunities,  and their successes and lessons learned in that quest.

## CASE STUDY #1 - MANSOUR GROUP: GENDER DIVERSITY AND EQUITY IN CORPORATE BUSINESS

The Mansour Group, founded 25 years ago in Egypt, is a family-owned conglomerate with 60,000 employees, a presence in 110 countries and total revenues exceeding $6 billion. It is one of the founding members of the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary  initiative  based  on  CEO  commitments  to implement sustainable and socially responsible policies. In Egypt, the Mansour Group maintains a total workforce of over 8,000 employees, however, women only make up 14 per cent of upper management, 4 per cent of middle management and 6 per cent of the workforce. While Mansour Group is realizing the importance of having more women employed in senior levels, one employee interviewed noted, 'A lot of our current top managers are those who got promoted from  the  bottom  up,  and  thus  they  are  all  males.

That's why we need to work on the [composition and diversity of the] workforce itself first,' emphasizing the need to prioritize gender equity at all levels.

Employees  interviewed  generally  felt  that  gender diversity contributes to greater success. As one employee stated, 'When there is more diversity there are more ideas, different opinions, backgrounds, varying perceptions  on  different  issue  and,  more  experiences. It is important to have diversity.' One should note  that  diversity  considerations  at  the  Mansour Group include both gender diversity and other elements: religious ones involving both Christians and Muslims; age, with the inclusion of young employees graduating  from  local  universities;  origin,  whether Cairo, Aswan or Nubia; and fields of education.

In 2008, the Mansour Group's human resources department, in cooperation with the Corporate Social Responsibility Department, reviewed its policies in terms  of  gender  responsiveness,  gender  diversity and  gender-based  discrimination  in  the  company. In  2015,  the  company  launched  a  programme  to empower  women  to  take  more  leadership  and management positions. This  was  accompanied  by gender-blind policy changes in the following areas:

- Hiring: The criteria for applicants to indicate their gender when applying for positions was removed. Applicants  and  employees  are  not  asked  about their families' future plans, or about the members of their families (except for medical insurance coverage purposes), which in the past had reinforced an unconscious bias in a candidate's selection.
-  Legislation: Labour  law  and  related  legislation are consistently applied towards both men and women, including Egypt's laws on family care.
-  Hours: Both  men  and  women  are  required  to work only from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m .to avoid the legal consequences of non-compliance that prohibits  women  in  Egypt  from  working  after 7:00 pm. Requiring or placing value on working after  7:00  p.m.  would  lead  to  discrimination from the very start of the selection criteria for new employees, or for employee advancement.
-  Pay: Equal  pay  for  the  same  job  is  adhered  to, based on a scale and grade.
-  Training: With the support of ILO, some employees are being trained to become gender-equality advocates.

Despite these advancements, barriers still exist to women's  participation  and  advancement  in  the labour  market.  As  one  employee  reported,  'The problem  is  not  with  rules  and  policies  […];  the problem  is  with  the  mindset  of  the  employees themselves […]. Even at home and with our families, mothers often prefer their sons to daughters. It is something that is embedded in our culture and passed down from one generation to another.'

These  attitudes  may  impact  women's  ability  to enter  the  workforce  and  the  types  of  jobs  and promotions accessible to them. A woman's partner may act as a gatekeeping mechanism, not allowing  her  to  participate  in  particular  types  of  work. Moreover, perceptions about women's preferences or suitability for certain types of work can impact women's employment opportunities. Womenfriendly  professions  are  perceived  to  be  human resources,  customer  service,  or  marketing  while accounting, bookkeeping, or those that may have security-related concerns, long hours, night shifts, or require physical labour (for example, drivers or warehouse workers) are regarded as inappropriate.

There  are  other  factors,  such  as  work-life  balance, which pose an issue, particularly for female employees, who are expected to take the lead in domestic affairs. One employee commented on the inequitable burden of care work on women, with male partners often not carrying out their share of household  responsibilities: 'I  have  seen  very  successful  career  women, but there is a price that is paid,  and  it  is  usually  paid  at  the  expense  of  the family. Some sacrifice must be made, especially as it is customary that familial responsibilities pertaining to both spouses are left to women.' Moreover, one  interviewee-employee  cautioned,  based  on experience with a previous employer, that experiences of sexual harassment, particularly in the face of cultural barriers against reporting such incidents, may lead female employees to leave in the absence of robust policies prohibiting and institutionalizing consequences for harassment.

The Mansour Group is continuing its commitment to gender-equitable policies and practices. In January 2018, they will launch a grievance mechanism with the corporate affairs and human resources departments - through policy and a call centre - for both men and women, where employees can talk freely about  any  issue:  sexual  and  verbal  harassment, abuse,  embezzlement  or  corruption,  for  example. This effort is supported by employees, as evidenced by one employee who commented, 'I believe that every person has certain human rights - the right to happiness, security, to have enough money to look after his/her family, to apply for a job, and not be abused in any way. These are all universal needs.'

The Mansour Group also aims to continue to provide empowerment training for female employees and awareness-raising sessions for men to better understand women's perspectives and to support them. They also may become more explicit in indicating that positions are open to both women and men when hiring. In 2018 and 2019, the Mansour Group will continue to work on the existing gender employment gap, and it will work with International Finance Corporation to introduce women into traditionally male-dominated positions.

Note: Interviews with Mansour Group were conducted  by  Ahead  of  the  Curve  in  December 2017  with  four  employees,  including  a  Corporate Human  Resources  and  Administration  Director,  a Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Manager,  a  Group Brand Manager, and a Medical Coverage Manager, with employment tenures with the Mansour Group ranging from 4 to 19 years.

## CASE STUDY #2 - BANK OF PALESTINE GENDER EQUALITY IN THE PRODUCT AND THE PROCESS

The Bank of Palestine was established in 1960 as a family business with the aim of promoting financial services in Palestine, and financing projects across the  economic  and  social  segments  of  Palestinian society.  The  Bank  is  one  of  the  largest  national banks operating in Palestine and one of the largest employers  nationwide,  employing  approximately 2,200 employees across its 70 branches operating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Currently, 37.6 per cent 57  of the Bank's employees are women with an increase from 17 per cent to 32 per cent taking place between 2007 and 2015.

The  Bank's  target  is  to  reach  a  minimum  of  50 per cent female employees by 2020. This commitment  to  advancing  gender  equity  in  the  Bank's workforce  has  in  part  been  driven  by  Chairman Hashem Shawwa, who stated: 'When I took over my position in the bank, I noticed a huge gender

imbalance that is not consistent with our inclusive policy. I knew then that I needed to take measures in that regard, and this is how our 10-year journey of  achieving  gender  balance  within  the  bank  and within our services started.'

The Bank's efforts toward these goals include the following initiatives: new gender-balanced policies in  hiring  and  employee  benefits;  promoting  more women  to  decision-making  and  senior  positions; and  introducing  financial  services  directed  specifically toward women's economic empowerment. This was in part informed by a Participatory Gender Audit conducted by UN Women for the Bank in 2015.

The Bank has made additional efforts to improve its gender-equitable policies. These include the following components:

-  Women's economic empowerment: The  Bank's Felestiniya (Palestinian  Woman) Programme aims  to  increase  women's  participation  in  the labour  market;  respond  to  the  financial  needs of  women,  including  entrepreneurs;  boost  the performance  of  women-owned  small  and  medium enterprises; and spur economic growth in the West Bank and Gaza by combining access to tailored  financial  products  with  non-financial services, such as networking, mentoring, coaching and access to business information.
-  Partnerships: The Bank establishes and strengthens partnerships with Palestinian women's organizations to foster a workplace  culture supportive of gender equality in the private and public sectors.
-  Labor  laws: The  Bank  of  Palestine's  policies surpass the Palestinian Labour Law's minimum requirements for promoting gender equality in the workplace, including administrative systems to prevent gender discrimination, such as introducing a health insurance policy allowing both male and female employees to insure their children rather than only men.
- Pay: The Bank stipulates equal pay for men and women working at the same job and the provision of an equal child allowance for female and male employees.
-  Advertisements: The Bank has created and implemented  written,  audio  and  visual  advertisements that challenge gender stereotypes.
-  Trainings: Gender  sensitization  is  now  part  of the  orientation  package  and  training  that  is provided  to  all  newly  hired  employees  at  the Bank. As the Chairman noted, 'I have seen many encouraging results and how our efforts contributed  to  changing  traditional  perceptions  and stereotypes among our employees.'
-  Parental  leave: The  Bank  gives  full,  ten  weeks paid  maternity  leave  to  its  female  employees but also recognizes three days paternity leave for the male employees, which, while quite limited, is  still  uncommon for private sector companies in Palestine.
-  Sexual  Harassment  and  Reporting: The  Bank's management  has  clear  whistle-blowing  procedures  that  encourage  both  male  and  female employees  to  report  any  internal  or  external violations  of  the  Bank's  policies  confidentially and  in  a  safe  environment,  including  in  cases of sexual harassment or discrimination against women within the workplace. As one employee said, 'The workplace culture we have encourages the employees to approach senior and upper management. It is a culture that is reinforced by an  open-door  policy  and  by  providing  various forms of communication and interaction on all levels,  such  as  the  Internet,  email,  staff  meetings,  a  suggestions  box,  clear  whistle-blowing procedures and a Facebook page for employees.'
-  Advancement: Opportunities for promotion are available  equally  to  all  employees.  As  one  employee noted, 'If there is a female candidate that can be promoted to a position, gender is taken into  consideration,  and  female  candidates  are encouraged to seek career advancement.'

While  the  Bank  has  made  significant  progress  in institutionalizing  guidelines  and  policies  that  promote gender equality in the workplace, they have also faced some challenges and setbacks. New and updated policies have occasionally been challenged by staff. As one employee noted, 'Male employees, in particular, felt threatened by female colleagues. They feel that policies favouring women's advancement  in  the  workplace  could  negatively  impact their  chances  of  promotion  to  higher  positions, and that female employees would be more entitled to  promotions.'  However,  these  attitudes  may  be changing as women begin to take on and succeed

in  new  roles.  One  employee  alluded  to  this  when he  said,  'I  was  astonished  when  our  female  employees,  who  were  given  greater  responsibilities, successfully proved to be up to the challenge and even exceeded their male colleagues' performance.'

Senior  management  also  initially  resisted  the  new policies.  There  was  some  reluctance  about  hiring married women, because it was feared they might take  maternity  leave  and  disrupt  the  Bank's  daily operations. Some members of management also felt that men would be able to work longer hours due to having fewer family obligations. 'Facing internal resistance is part of the process,' the Chairman added in the interview for this case study. He went on, 'We persisted with our efforts to demonstrate how serious the bank was about making those changes. At the same time, we took many steps to handle these challenges  as  we  realized  that  we  were  talking about changing the organizational culture and for some individuals it involved changing their personal beliefs.' To address this, the Bank brought in experts and specialists for trainings and to share case studies to help realize the process of transforming norms.

This  dedicated,  participatory  process  of  change seems to  have  worked.  Since  the  aforementioned gender  audit,  female  employees  have  given  encouraging  feedback,  reporting  feeling  empowered and  not  being  discriminated  against.  And  it  has been good for the Bank's reputation as well as its bottom  line,  as  the  Chairman  notes,  'We  are  attracting more investors and funds that perceive us as  a  progressive  bank,  one  respected  locally  and internationally and we are attracting more clients including many women clients as they see our bank as  approachable,  friendly  and  attentive  to  their financial  needs.  All  our  internal  and  external  assessments show that most of our employees - and especially  our  female  employees  -  see  BOP  [Bank of Palestine]. as the employer of choice.' According to some staff interviewees, the experience of Bank of  Palestine  is  a  success  story  with  promise  to  be scaled up both to other Palestinian institutions and regionally, and with the potential to impact norms in society more broadly.

There is a recognition, however,  that to shift entrenched behaviour patterns toward gender equality, eradicate the feminization of poverty and to do this work sustainably, it is important to institutionalize existing policies at the Bank, to implement them in a comprehensive way and to engage employees from the beginning of the process.

Note:  The  interviews  with  the  Bank  of  Palestine were conducted by Riyada Consulting and Training in December 2017 and January 2018 with four employees,  including  the  Chief  of  Business  Development and the Financial Inclusion Officer,  a  Human Resources  Manager,  a  Chief  Corporate  Business Officer and the Chairman of Bank of Palestine, who was directly responsible for designing the genderequitable policies introduced in the Bank.

While both case studies presented above highlight useful  entry  points  and  lessons  learned  for  establishing  more  gender  equitable  workplaces  -  in policy  and  practice  -  companies  should  strive  to go  even  further,  deliberately  engaging  male  and female  employees  with  a  gender-transformative lens and approach, aiming to transform not only the behaviours  and  mandates  of  employees,  but  also the underlying social and gender norms that view women primarily as wives and mothers, or as having less autonomy or value in the workplace than men.

## VI. TRANSLATING THESE INSIGHTS INTO CONCRETE GUIDANCE FOR THE MENA REGION

Business leaders seeking to build upon the insights presented in  this  brief  and  boost  safety  and  gender  equality  in  their  workplaces  for  all  employees should undertake the following initiatives:

1. Create  an  atmosphere  where  women  feel safe in the workplace: Support women's wellbeing, first and foremost: physically, mentally and  emotionally.  Safe  working  environments increase  women's  commitment  to  the  workplace and improve their performance. Policies should  explicitly  prohibit  sexual  harassment in  the  workplace,  and  also  mandate  gendersensitive,  awareness-raising  trainings  for  all staff and management. These should address the underlying stereotypes and norms around men and women that sanction and drive this behaviour. Meaningful disciplinary action against known perpetrators of sexual harassment in the workplace should be carried out. A system of referrals for services for survivors, including to legal services, should be established.

2. Eliminate any discrimination from hiring practices: Institute gender-neutral hiring processes, including abolishing the requirement that anyone list their gender. Consider stating explicitly on  job  postings  that  the  company  is  seeking both male and female applicants, and reaching out to women's professional alliances and associations. When hiring, create clear, gendersensitive  systems  for  evaluating  candidates, and consider introducing quotas or affirmative action protocols. Explicitly request candidates with experience with gender-equitable initiatives  in  job  descriptions  for  human  resources personnel  and  hiring  managers,  and  fill  hiring  panels  with  equal  numbers  of  men  and women.
3. Support  and  advance  women's  leadership: Rather than a case-by-case basis, use a comprehensive approach to achieve parity. Create clear paths to management  positions for women, by implementing executive trainings, coaching/mentoring programmes, exposing women to all  company  operations  and  functions,  ensuring  senior  management  support for  a  gender  equality  strategy  and  making promotion  systems  and  career  advancement prospects clear and accessible.
4. Take steps to abolish discrimination based on the following:
- Questions  on  current  or  future  employees' plans related to their families. It  is  inappropriate to ask employees about their plans for a  family  as  this  provides  opportunities  for discrimination against women.
- Level  within  the  organization. Make  sure any policies to promote gender equality are applied at every level of the workforce, not as a special policy only for women in senior leadership and management.
- Gender .  Ensure  that  all  employee  policies are applied equally to male and female employees, including, importantly, equal pay for equal work and parental leave policies.
5. Show  leadership  on  the  issues. Executives within the workplace can play a transformative role in both introducing and promoting gender equality  as  a  social  responsibility  and  as  a

business development objective. They can also set a standard and lead by example in order to catalyze a shift in norms and company culture alongside  policies.  But  they  should  not  do  it alone. Leaders should involve employees at all levels in the development and implementation of  policies  in  order  to  ensure  effectiveness, buy-in and their adoption.

6. Embrace  equal,  job-protected,  non-transferable,  paid  parental  leave  for  new  parents  of all genders: Offer parental leave that is equal, paid  and  non-transferable  to  encourage  and allow all parents to be responsible for the care and upbringing of their children, removing the burden from women and promoting their continued employment. In addition, enact policies that guarantee parents the same or equal position upon their return from leave. In addition to leave for new parents (including parents of newly adopted children), flexible leave policies and  flexible  work  arrangements  and  hours are  also  important  signs  that  the  employer supports its employees' caregiving and family needs in balance with their roles and responsibilities in the workplace.
7. Combine workplace policies with programmes, campaigns and broader gender equality initiatives: The  effectiveness  of  workplace  policies can be multiplied and improved by being combined with gender-transformative programmes and campaigns - engaging male employees in partnership with women, company leadership, families and society at large - to transform social norms that view women primarily as wives and mothers. The aim is to dispel employers' assumptions that women's roles in the home interfere with their productivity and commitment, and to increase equitable childcare and work in the home.
8. Highlight the value in gender-equitable workplaces for men as well. While efforts to support gender equality and non-discrimination should be pursued as a fundamental right for women, in order for change to be deep-rooted and sustainable, men must also be personally invested in these attitudinal shifts. Workplaces must go beyond  identifying  a  few  male  'champions' who support changes toward gender equitable policies, to working with a broader cohort who

see women as truly equal, and themselves as invested allies in reaching equality. Men must understand how their own lives are gendered and  even  constrained  by  norms  that  encourage them to act solely as providers, as distant fathers or as ambitious employees, but which punish or sanction them for taking on caregiving roles outside of work, or for any perceived lack  of  professional  ambition. They  must  understand  and  embrace  the  benefits  that  can emerge  from  gender  equitable  policies  and workplaces built on respect, including greater work-life  balance,  more  diverse  and  cooperative  workplaces,  and  the  health,  emotional authenticity and deeper relationships that can emerge  from  being  co-providers  rather  than the sole providers for their families.

## VI. CONCLUSION

Global evidence and experience proves that gender equality  is  a  fundamental  element  of  prosperous and  progressive  societies,  and  that  gender  equal workplaces  have  far-reaching  positive  effects,  including on the economy. In an environment where Governments  in  MENA  are  searching  for  new sources of economic growth, greater equality of opportunity and better protection of women's rights are  necessary  for  the  development  and  advancement of the MENA region, and may offer important incentives and benefits - economic and others - to businesses.

The need to drive and support gender equality in the workplace is urgent in the MENA region. Here, the share of formal sector employment, including leadership  positions  and  firm  ownership  held  by women lags far behind the percentage owned by men, as well as the share held by women in other regions, a situation due to both social and gender norms and structural impediments.

Certain businesses, such as the Mansour Group in Egypt  and  the  Bank  of  Palestine,  profiled  in  this brief,  alongside  alliances,  National  Governments, civil society organizations, United Nations entities, local activists and other parties in the MENA region have  already  begun  to  take  action  in  the  area  of laws  and  legislative  tools;  recruitment  and  hiring practices; child-friendly workplace policies; policies prohibiting  sexual  harassment;  ensuring  safe  and reliable  transportation;  the promotion of women into management and executive positions; formation  of  alliances,  organizations  and  professional networks; and mandatory trainings on gender, diversity  and  other  topics  to  invest  in  more  equal, thriving companies and societies.

The pathway is clear for business leaders who want to  invest  in  creating  gender-equitable  workplaces and supportive cultures within their companies.

UN WOMEN IS THE UN ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO GENDER EQUALITY AND THE EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN. A GLOBAL CHAMPION FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS, UN WOMEN WAS ESTABLISHED TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS ON MEETING THEIR NEEDS WORLDWIDE.

UN Women supports UN Member States as they set global standards for achieving gender equality, and works with governments and civil society to design laws, policies, programmes and services needed to implement these standards. It stands behind women's equal participation in all aspects of life, focusing on five priority areas: increasing women's leadership and participation; ending violence against women; engaging women in all aspects of peace and security processes; enhancing women's economic empowerment; and making gender equality central to national development planning and budgeting. UN Women also coordinates and promotes the UN system's work in advancing gender equality.
