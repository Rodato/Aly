## Glossary on Terminology

Boys' disengagement from education is understood as a gendered phenomenon partly rooted in societal norms and concepts of masculinity, which can lead boys and young men to consciously or unconsciously to withdraw from education. Additional social, economic and cultural factors, in families, communities and schools, may also lead to boys' low engagement with education and contribute to school leaving/dropout. Disengagement from education can manifest in different forms such as lack of interest, poor participation, absenteeism, neglecting homework or exam preparation and ultimately, dropping out (UNESCO, 2022a).

Curriculum (Plural: Curricula) is an inventory of activities related to the design, organization and planning of an education or training action, including definition of learning objectives, content, methods (including assessment) and material. In simple terms, a description of what, why, how and when students should learn (UNESCO-IIEP, n.d.; UNESCO-IBE, 2013).

Disadvantage in education refers to the intersecting social, economic, cultural, or structural conditions that limit educational access, participation, and outcomes. Disadvantage can lead to particular groups (e.g. boys or girls) having lower enrolment, retention and completion rates, and poorer educational outcomes, including subject mastery and attainment.

Discrimination is an unfair treatment or arbitrary distinction based on a person's race, sex, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, age, language, social origin or other status (UNESCO, 2022b).

Drop-out or school leaving refers to leaving school before the completion of a given stage of education or leaving at some intermediate or non-terminal point in a cycle of schooling. It can be temporary or definitive and can be the result of an active decision made by the learner or the result of push and/or pull factors (based on UNESCO-IIEP, n.d.)

Educational space is a space where teaching and learning takes place. It can be inside or outside the school, physical or virtual. This can include classrooms, libraries, community spaces (e.g. youth centers), as well as e-learning platforms.

Gender refers to the culturally defined roles, attributes, behaviours, identities and expectations associated with being male or female in a given context. It shapes how individuals act and interact, and the distribution of power and resources in relationships and society. Gender can be expressed through male, female, and non-binary identities and may or may not be congruent with the sex assigned to an individual at their time of birth . (based on UNESCO, 2022b).

Gender-based violence refers to violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering, against someone based on gender discrimination, gender role expectations and/or gender stereotypes, or based on the differential power status linked to gender (UNESCO, 2022b).

Gender equality in education means that the right to education of all learners is respected equally regardless of gender. Learners of all genders are given equal access to learning opportunities, resources and protections, and learners of all genders benefit from and are treated in education equally (based on UNESCO, 2019a).

Gender equality through education refers to education's key role in addressing the wider issue of gender equality. Educational institutions can promote equitable attitudes, changing the way people think about traditional gender roles and helping to build long-term sustainable change. And achieving equal outcomes for female, male and non-binary learners can help to empower all people to create better lives (UNESCO, 2019a).

Gender norms are understood as ideas about how men and women should behave: the expectations and standards that are set for each gender in different societies, cultures and communities. They are both context- and time-specific. People internalize these 'rules' at an early age, in the beginning of a cycle of gender socialization and stereotyping that continues for the rest of their lives. Gender norms thus not only become individuals' expectations of others, but also of themselves. Gender norms can be harmful, such as those that limit individuals' behaviours, opportunities, aspirations or relationships based on their gender, or that reinforce unequal power relations between genders (see also 'harmful and restrictive masculinities'). They can also be positive, when they promote equity, inclusion and shared power, for example, by encouraging people of all genders to pursue a full range of roles, express themselves freely, and share responsibilities (see also 'positive and inclusive masculinities'). The socialization process happening within educational institutions often replicates that of broader society and can contribute to the reproduction of social and gender norms (Marcus et al. 2024; UNICEF et al., 2019; Cookson et al., 2023; Stromquist, 2007).

Gender parity in education is an indicator of the ratio of girls to boys, women to men. Gender parity is reached when there is equal representation and participation of male and female learners in education. It is a useful indicator, but by itself does not measure gender equality (UNESCO, 2022b).

Gender-responsive means that strategies include evidence-based gender analysis which identifies and acknowledges existing gender differences, needs and inequalities. Activities at this level include specific policies and actions that address inequalities. Gender-responsive strategies, such as training in gender-responsive pedagogy, can be used as part of a system-wide, gender-transformative approach to education.

Gender-responsive pedagogy is understood as teaching and learning processes that pay attention to the specific learning needs of learners of different genders. In practical terms, this means that the learning materials, methodologies, content, learning activities, language use, classroom interaction, assessment and classroom set up respond to specific needs of learners of different genders (UNESCO-IIEP, n.d.).

Gender socialisation is the process through which individuals learn, internalize, and perform socially constructed gender norms, roles, and behaviours. This occurs through interactions with key agents of socialization, such as family, peers, the media, and social institutions. For example, boys learn and internalize how 'real men' should be through gender socialization (John et al., 2017).

Gender stereotypes are simplistic generalizations about the gender attributes, differences and roles of girls, women, boys and men and people of other genders (UN Women, 2025).

A gender-transformative approach entails addressing the underlying causes of gender inequalities. It includes implementing policies and initiatives which not only address the different needs, aspirations, capacities and contributions of girls, boys, women, men and non-binary people, but also challenge existing and discriminatory policies and practices, creating radical change. A gender-transformative approach to education is one that encompasses policy, programming and interventions to create opportunities to actively challenge gender norms and wider inequalities. This includes promoting gender equality through curricular and teaching reforms (UNESCO, 2022a).

Harmful and restrictive masculinities are linked to hegemonic gender norms which suggest that boys and men should conform to a 'right' or 'ideal' way to be a man or a boy (see 'hegemonic masculinity'). This 'ideal' places pressure on boys and men to conform to certain expectations, which often include being self-sufficient, acting tough and using aggression to solve conflict. It is constructed in opposition to femininities and/or marginalized masculinities. Such ideas and practices of masculinity are harmful to girls, women and non-binary people as they uphold men's privilege over women and non-binary people. They are also harmful to boys and men, who are regulated by rigid expectations of manhood that restrict their freedom to express emotions, seek help, or deviate from dominant masculine norms. Harmful and restrictive masculinities can undermine boys' motivation and learning, because they often position academic effort and aspiration as incompatible with being a 'real' boy or man, affecting boys' motivation to learn (Heilman et al., 2017; UNESCO, 2022a; UNESCO-IBE, 2025 WHO, 2019).

Hegemonic masculinity is the culturally dominant form of masculinity that is commonly upheld as the 'right' or 'ideal' way to be a man or a boy. In many contexts it positions men and boys as superior to women and girls and people of other gender identities, with negative consequences for people of all genders (Connell, 2005; Marcus et al., 2024).

Homophobia refers to fear, discomfort, intolerance or hatred of homosexuality or sexually diverse people (UNESCO, 2015).

Inclusive education is the process of strengthening the capacity of the education system to reach out to and include all students (UNESCO, 2022b).

LGBTIQ+ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer/questioning people, with the '+' symbol acknowledging those who identify as gender-diverse and who use additional terminologies. Lesbian refers to a woman who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to other women. Gay refers to a person, often understood to be a man, who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to people of the same gender. Bisexual refers to a person who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to more than one gender. Transgender refers to a person whose gender identity and/or expression differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Intersex refers to a person born with physical sex characteristics (such as chromosomes, sexual anatomy, or reproductive organs) that do not fit typical definitions of male or female. Queer is often used as an umbrella term for sexual and gender diversity. Questioning refers to a person who is exploring or uncertain about their sexual orientation or gender identity (based on UNESCO, 2020; UNESCO, 2019b; UNESCO, 2016).

Non-binary is an umbrella term that refers to a gender identity outside of the male-female gender binary. This can include people with a specific gender identity other than man or woman, people who identify as two or more genders, and people who do not identify with any gender (based on UNHCR, 2024).

Positive and healthy masculinities emphasize the constructive aspects of masculine identities. They serve as a counterpoint to harmful and restrictive gender norms that portray men and boys as potential perpetrators or aggressors and focus solely on the harm they cause to themselves and others. It emphasises that all boys and men should be free to express diverse expressions of positive masculinities without fear of exclusion, ridicule or violence. Positive and healthy masculinities refer to alternative expressions of 'hegemonic masculinity' (see above) that align with egalitarian values and promote health and well-being. Examples include committed fatherhood and partnership, caring and intimacy, and help-seeking behaviour. The use of the plural term 'masculinities' underscores that there are many positive ways to be a boy or man. It also recognizes that masculine (and feminine) gender norms differ across cultures and contexts and change over time. Promoting positive and healthy masculinities is central in efforts to shift gender norms that harm boys and men and the people around them (based on UNESCO, 2014; UN Women, 2016). Sex: Refers to the biological characteristics that distinguish males, females and intersex individuals (UNESCO, 2022b). Sex characteristics are physical or biological features. Sexual orientation refers to a person's capacity for profound emotional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender, the same gender or more than one gender (UNESCO, 2019b; UNESCO, 2016). Social norms refer to rules, often informal and implicit, that guide how people are expected to behave in a group or society. People are often rewarded for conforming to these norms and punished for deviating from them (Marcus et al., 2024). Teaching and learning materials are understood as tools and resources used by educators to support their lesson planning and delivery, and by students in their learning process. They include a wide range of products such as textbooks, workbooks, visual aids, storybooks, digital/online resources, classroom handouts and assessments (UNESCO-IIEP, n.d.). A whole-school approach considers the entire school ecosystem rather than its individual parts when working with students and teachers to achieve change, for example towards gender equality. Common elements of a whole-school approach are policies, teacher training, pedagogies, environments and engaging with parents and caregivers (Marcus et al., 2024; Plan International et al., 2021).

| The Lifting Barriers Global Resources on supporting boys' engagement in education is designed to complement, not compete with, existing efforts to promote girls' education and gender equality in schools. Significant progress has been made in addressing barriers to girls' education and this important work must continue. At the same time, many boys face challenges that impact their learning, well-being, and future opportunities. This guide aims to be a complement to broader gender equality efforts, including those focused on girls' education. Teachers, parents, and school leaders can use the Lifting Barriers materials alongside existing strategies to ensure all learners have the support they need to succeed. Strengthening boys' engagement in education is not just about improving outcomes for boys; it also contributes to gender equality more broadly. When schools challenge harmful and restrictive masculine norms and foster more inclusive spaces, girls as well as boys benefit from more equitable learning |

## Overview

The Classroom Lesson Plans for Learners on Masculinities and Gender Equality was developed and informed by key recommendations from UNESCO's report, Leave No Child Behind: Global Report on Boy's Disengagement from Education . Boys' disengagement from education is caused by multiple factors that lead boys and young men to withdraw from education, either consciously or unconsciously. While there are many driving factors behind boy's disengagement, findings from the report highlight that among them, social and gender norms pose a significant obstacle to boys in their pursuit of education and lifelong learning.

The Classroom Lesson Plans aim to provide educators with a gender-transformative and asset-based approach to working with boys in formal educational spaces. Designed to be led and facilitated by educators, these lessons aim to work with learners to challenge the harmful gender norms driving boys' disengagement in the classroom and support the creation of more inclusive learning environments for creating greater gender equality for all.

Guide

The Classroom Lesson Plans are part of a set of global resources developed under the Lifting Barriers Project supported by the Global Partnership for Education's Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE-KIX), a joint endeavour with the International Development Research Centre, Canada. These resources are for educators both inside and outside of formal education system and include:

## Lifting Barriers Global Resources

- Educator's Guide: Start here! A resource to promote gender-transformative and inclusive pedagogy, equipping educators with strategies to create gender-equitable learning environments that support boys' growth and academic success, alongside their peers.
- Guide to Working with Parents and Caregivers to Support Boys' Education : A guide for schools and key stakeholders to engage parents in discussions about the value of boys' education and how gender equality positively impacts their well-being.
- Boys Club Implementation Guide: A resource to support facilitators in creating and sustaining Boys' Clubs-safe, engaging spaces where boys can explore healthy and positive masculinity, build social-emotional skills, and contribute to gender equality and their own educational success.
- Guidance for Teaching and Learning Materials: This guide has been developed to support Ministries of Education and other stakeholders involved in the revision or development of teaching and learning materials with the aim of ensuring that these materials actively promote gender equality and inclusion.

## Boys' Disengagement from Education and the Role of Educators

Globally, boys' disengagement from school is driven by social, economic, and cultural factors, including harmful gender norms - society's unwritten rules about how men and women should be. The school environment and other educational factors such as rigid teaching methods and harsh discipline, and rigid gender norms in school also play a large role in driving boys' disengagement. Specifically, the factors that drive boys' disengagement from education vary by setting, but can include 1 :

- Economic Factors . In their families, boys can face pressure to be economic providers forcing them to prioritize household financial well-being over schooling. In other places, poor families may struggle with food insecurity, inadequate health care and community violence, all of which negatively impact children's ability to attend school regularly.
- Example: Boys in lower secondary schools in Jamaica often leave school to contribute to household income or due to early employment opportunities (Stampini et al., 2018; UNESCO, 2022c).
- Social Factors . For example, influences from peers to engage in risk-taking behavior such as substance abuse, peer violence, and addiction to gaming. Boys are also vulnerable to harmful influences from social media that promote stereotypical versions of manhood. All of this can undermine their focus on education. Families and communities can contribute to boys' disengagement from education by not providing academic support or encouragement for reasons such as they view schooling as less important than being in paid employment.
- Educational Factors . Rigid teaching methods that leave little room for flexibility, creativity, or adaptation to students' needs, an emphasis on memorization versus critical thinking, and the lack of inclusive or learner-centered programs can make boys' disengagement worse, alongside limited safe spaces, and insufficient mental health support (e.g. psychological counseling). In addition, boys can also face corporal punishment and other forms of violence from their educators.
- Rigid Social and Gender Norms. Harmful and restrictive masculine norms both inside and outside the classroom are barriers to boys' engagement in education. Increasingly, academic achievement is seen as 'feminine,' discouraging boys from reading and engaging fully in the classroom.
- Examples from two countries: Boys interested in reading are mocked in Chile as reading is viewed as a feminine activity (Espinoza and Strasser 2020); Older boys in the UK show decreasing interest in reading, especially after primary school (Picton &amp; Clark, 2019; OECD, 2015).
- Policy Factors . Few policies address boys' disengagement from education and those that do exist are limited in approach and reach, and may even have an adverse impact on boy's engagement with formal education.
- Example: Zero-tolerance policies in the United States that require strict, predetermined punishments such as expulsion or suspension have led to the exclusion of a huge number of African American boys involved in discipline issues (Bell 2015; Johnson and Johnson 2023).

1 Forthcoming Scoping Study

There are many long-term costs to boys and wider society when they are not engaged in education. These include 2 :

- Poorer economic outcomes , such as lower salaries since higher educational attainment often translate into acquiring skills that are better remunerated. 3
- Poorer health and wellbeing . Research shows men with higher educational attainment have better health outcomes, while a lack of education and employment opportunities can push men into poverty and to have poorer health outcomes.
- Worse gender attitudes and relationships . Better educated men are more likely to support policies that promote gender equality and protect women from discrimination, while poorer gender attitudes are linked with men's perpetration violence against intimate partners, and unequal caregiving roles in the household. 4

While school-level factors such as harsh discipline, unequal gender norms, and experiences of peer violence can discourage boys from achieving their educational goals, educators and the educational institutions where they work play a crucial role in creating inclusive school environments where boys can thrive . This resource, alongside other Lifting Barriers Global Resources , highlights ways that educators can strengthen student-teacher relationships, create opportunities to learn from peers, and promote a sense of inclusiveness and fairness. All of this contributes to boys' sense of belonging in school and overall sense of happiness (see Box. UNESCO's Happy Schools Initiative).

## UNESCO's Happy Schools Initiative

This resource is equally important in complementing UNESCO's global Happy Schools Initiative, which urges education authorities to prioritize happiness in education and expand joyful learning practices from schools to policy levels, guided by UNESCO's global Happy Schools framework. The model comprises four pillars people, process, place, and principles - and 12 high-level criteria for integrating happiness into education systems. Building Happy Schools recognizes that unequal social and gender norms can lead to bias, stigma, discrimination, and violence - all of which contribute to decreased well-being and learning. This resource, alongside the other Lifting Barriers resources, aim to provide teachers with tools to create more inclusive spaces that support boys' educational achievement, alongside girls and nonbinary learners.

To better understand and explore how broader gender norms, boys' individual gender attitudes, and educators' own gender biases can influence teaching behavior in the classroom, see the Educator's Guide for Educating Boys [LINK] . The Educator's Guide also provides information on some of the driving factors behind boys' disengagement, interactive exercises and tools to provoke critical reflection on harmful gender norms that can be done individually or in groups, and provides recommendations on how to promote more gender-transformative educational spaces and stronger educator-learner relationships.

## Purpose of the Classroom Lesson Plans for Learners and Main Objectives

This Classroom Resource includes 10 gender-transformative , interactive, and participatory Lesson Plans that can be done with boys and their peers, regardless of their gender identity. Taking a gender-transformative approach to education means working with boys and their peers to critically reflect on and challenge the root causes of gender inequality, such as the harmful gender attitudes and behaviors that perpetuate boys' disengagement from the classroom, and encouraging them to discover and embrace more peaceful and equitable alternatives. These Lesson Plans also take an asset-based approach to engaging boys. Rather than treating them as problems to be fixed, it recognizes their strengths, leadership potential, and capacity for growth. The purpose of these Lesson Plans is to provide guidance to educators on how to nurture boys' existing sense of care, empathy for others, sense of justice and responsibility, while also helping them to develop skills that benefit both their personal development and educational attainment.

Equally important, this guide emphasizes the link between gender equality and educational engagement . Research shows that harmful and restrictive masculine norms can contribute to school disengagement, low academic performance, and dropout rates among boys. By addressing these norms and promoting positive identities, the Classroom Lesson Plans help foster an environment where boys feel supported in their learning, motivated to succeed academically, and encouraged to see education as a key part of their future.

By using these Classroom Lesson Plans, educators will help all learners, especially boys, to:

1. Reflect critically on how gender norms and stereotypes influence their experiences and attitudes toward learning, and imagine more equitable possibilities;
2. Strengthen their collective ability to challenge power imbalances and foster a more respectful and inclusive school environment;
3. Develop more positive peer relationships that are supportive of educational success;
4. Learn how to normalize the healthy expression of emotions and help-seeking behavior, especially in school.

## How To Use These Lesson Plans

## Who are these Lesson Plans for?

These lesson plans are for educators (e.g. teachers, teacher trainers, teaching assistants) working with upper primary school learners (roughly, ages 9 to 12 years old). The ages of upper primary students vary slightly across different countries, but generally, 'upper primary' refers to the last few years of primary education before transitioning to lower secondary school. This is because globally, research shows that, in many places, boys are more likely than girls to face difficulties in the transition between upper primary to secondary school. 5 Therefore, objectives, activities, and discussion questions are mostly centered on the gender-specific challenges and opportunities boys have in their pursuit of education.

However, all learners should be enabled to challenge rigid gender norms and learn from educational materials that are gender-transformative. This means educators can use these lesson plans with all learners, regardless of their gender identity, to promote a positive learning culture inclusive and free from stereotypes. Educators and their educational institutions should consider implementing these Lesson Plans alongside other gender equality initiatives such as ones focused on girls' education (see A Whole School Approach further below). Educators can also adapt sessions to broaden reflection on how new insights, skills, and awareness can benefit every learners' ability to succeed in education .

## Mixed Gender vs. Separated Groups

These Lesson Plans are designed to be used with both girls and boys in mixed gender spaces. However, some learners benefit more from activities and group reflections when they are separated into smaller gender-segregated groups. Separate spaces allow for open sharing, while mixed gender discussions can help build understanding.  Educators managing large class sizes may find it challenging to split students by gender for deeper reflection on sensitive topics. Depending on the context, these discussions can take place by, for example, splitting learners into smaller gender-specific groups. Even without physical separation, think of ways to create opportunities for reflection through carefully structured activities that encourage all students to engage thoughtfully and respectfully.

## Lesson Plan Structure

These Lesson Plans are designed to slowly build boys and their peers' understanding of how harmful and restrictive gender (and masculine) norms impact their educational success, their relationships, a healthy sense of self, and how they can embrace a freer, more expansive sense of identity and possibility. These Lesson Plans use diverse pedagogical techniques such as role-playing, group discussions, debates, games, and self-reflection to appeal to a diversity of

boys and different learning styles. Gender roles, norms, and equality will be discussed throughout each of these Lessons.

At the beginning of each Lesson, you will find Teaching Tip Sheets that provide background information about the Lesson's topic, and recommendations on how to ensure  a well-run session. Take time to review the Teaching Tip Sheet well in advance of doing the Lesson Plan.

In each Lesson Plan, there are three activities. Each activity is designed to be 20 minutes in length, with the total length of one Lesson Plan being 1 hour. If you implement one 20-minute activity per week, you will have 30 weeks of activities. However, the activities are designed in such a way that they can also be combined with the other activities in the Lesson to create a longer session. For example, if you have 40 minutes, you could do 2 out of the 3 activities in the Lesson Plan. The activities are ordered in such a way to build learners' understanding and exploration of the topic. For this reason, it is recommended that the Lesson Plans and Activities be conducted in order (i.e. Lesson 1 all the way to Lesson 10).

## Where should these Lesson Plans be implemented?

These Lesson Plans should be implemented with groups of learners in an educational setting either in a physical space, such as a classroom, or in a virtual learning space. They can also be used in non-formal education settings such as youth community centers that provide mentorship, tutoring, or life skills programming. Educators can also further reinforce learning and create broader enabling environments for boys' educational attainment by incorporating the key messages from the lessons outside the learning space. For example, learners and educators can work together to create school campaigns, activities during annual school days, and organize assemblies centered on the main themes of these lessons to encourage school-wide reflection and action.

## What Is My Role in these Lesson Plans?

Your role in these Lesson Plans is to create a safe environment, listen openly, and encourage more discussion among your learners. You do not have to necessarily be a subject matter 'expert,' but in addition to having engaged in gender training organized by your educational institution, it is important to read through and do the exercises contained in the Educators' Guide , a resource under the Lifting Barriers project. The Educators' Guide provides educators with strategies to create gender-equitable learning environments that support boys' growth and academic success, alongside their peers. Above all, it is important that you learn about how gender and norms around masculinities influence boys' disengagement in the classroom, as well as how personal biases and experiences influence your teaching practices and ways of communication.

Many of the activities in these Lesson Plans ask learners to share sensitive life experiences, such as struggling in school or issues with friends. In line with a trauma-informed approach, you can help create a safe and supportive environment by modeling this behavior with small personal experiences of your own, or by preparing other realistic examples. A trauma-informed approach means recognizing that some learners may carry difficult past experiences and ensuring classroom activities do not re-trigger or shame them. For example, you might:

- Give students the option to 'pass' if they are not comfortable sharing.
- Use hypothetical or role-play scenarios instead of requiring personal disclosures.

When boys are engaged in critical discussions about what it means to be a man or that ask them to be vulnerable by sharing personal experiences of struggle, this might be the first time they are discussing such topics. Doing so in front of their peers can be even more intimidating, especially in a mixed gender setting. Here are some recommendations to implement the Lesson Plans in ways that create safer and more accepting spaces for boys and their peers. Recommendations for Engaging Boys:

## ● Affirm Boys' Positive Traits and Contributions

- o Highlight when boys show kindness, leadership, or courage.
- o Reinforce the idea that masculinity can include traits like empathy, cooperation, and care for others.
- o Recognize small moments of growth and effort, not just big achievements.
- Avoid making broad statements about boys.
- o Avoid saying phrases such as 'all boys misbehave' or 'girls are nicer than boys' because these statements are not universally true, and they can put boys on the defensive causing them to disengage from group discussions.
- Be empathetic to boys' lived experiences.
- o As boys talk, put yourself in their shoes. Being a young boy in early adolescence is a delicate and difficult period. More than anything, they want to feel accepted by their peers, and sometimes embracing harmful versions of manhood is a way they gain acceptance.
- Encourage self-reflection and affirm boys' positive aspirations for the future.
- o The Lessons will ask questions for boys and their peers to reflect on how to be more engaged in their education, encourage them in challenging and rejecting harmful behaviors, and also motivate them to celebrate individual characteristics that do not align with rigid and restrictive notions of gender. Find opportunities where you can continue such encouragement both in and outside of these Lessons.
- Normalize mistakes and growth through accountability.
- Reassure boys that everyone makes mistakes and may at times cause harm, often unintentionally. What's most important is being open to learning from those mistakes, taking responsibility, making amends where possible, and committing to doing better moving forward.

Above all, throughout the Lessons it is important to remain patient and supportive. Remember, supporting boys' positive attitudes and behaviors towards educational attainment is a long process. Participation in these Lessons will not necessarily lead to an immediate transformation of young boys' lives and relationships. It is the beginning of a process for promoting personal change.

## A Whole School Approach

Gender equality-focused efforts to address boys' disengagement from education must be approached thoughtfully and in conjunction with wider school mandates and initiatives. They should also be communicated transparently with parents and caregivers. In short, these Lesson Plans should not be implemented in isolation but rather as part of a whole school approach to promote gender equality . According to UNESCO, a whole school approach involves addressing the needs of learners, staff and the wider community, not only within the curriculum, but across the whole-school and learning environment. 6 In the context of addressing boys' disengagement in schools, this can mean:

- -Working with key educational allies and networks to advocate for national and local education policies mandating gender equality education in the classroom;
- -Developing a school-wide strategy, action plans, and school policies driven by school leadership committed to creating an enabling environment for all learners, especially boys, to thrive.
- -Working with school leadership to identify gender 'champions' within schools to help embed ideas and practice, and to adapt the Lesson Plans so they fit within established curricula standards.
- -Training school leaders and professional teacher networks, such as teachers' unions, connected with the educational institution, on the effects of harmful and restrictive masculine norms on boys' educational attainment, and using the Lifting Barriers Resources such as the Educator's Guide and Lesson Plans to implement gender-transformative education effectively.
- -Briefing primary caregivers (e.g. parents/guardians) on the implementation of boys' engagement in education initiatives, and encouraging them to support their child at home wherever possible to ensure continued engagement and positive reinforcement. The Lifting Barriers, Parents Guide , provides structured guidance on how to run parent and caregiver meetings to both present the initiative on boys' education as well as how to share the impacts.

## Tips on Managing Resistance with Boys

Defensiveness and backlash: Critical discussions about the relationship between gender, masculinity, power, privilege and gender-based discrimination (e.g. prejudice and hostility towards women and girls) can elicit anger, defensiveness and resistance within some adolescent boys. Rather than viewing angry, resistant and defensive responses as 'problems', see them more as opportunities to engage constructively with boys who are in a process of critically thinking about and working through their inherited beliefs about gender and masculinity. Give boys space to speak about any grievances, frustrations or discomfort they feel about gender-related issues.

Listen to these feelings, but do not validate them or agree with discriminatory or hateful comments. Acknowledge that not all boys or men experience power and privilege in the same way-factors like class, race, sexuality, (dis)abilities and ethnicity can shape the opportunities and challenges they face. These differences matter and can influence how boys relate to conversations about gender and fairness. Point out that boys and men can play an active role in building a culture that supports healthy, respectful and equitable social relationships by helping to tackle and prevent harmful practices, such as gender-based discrimination, racism, classism and so forth.

Discriminatory and hateful comments: Educators should be mindful that they may hear discriminatory and hateful comments when discussing harmful forms of masculinity. Listen to, but do not validate, harmful or discriminatory comments. A range of appropriate and proportionate responses can be used to deal with these responses, such as friendly reminders to the whole group to respect the 'group agreement'. However, try not to shut down or ban specific topics about masculinity from discussion as this may lead boys to feel that their views, concerns and experiences are not being heard. Instead, ask questions that aim to promote critical thinking e.g., 'How would you feel if someone you care for was treated this way?'. Asking such questions can also cultivate empathy for those who have been subjected to such discrimination, which can help participants to understand their negative impacts.

Personal boundaries and self-care: If you find yourself emotionally affected or triggered by resistance or difficult comments from learners, it's okay to pause and seek support. You can ask for a break, reach out to a colleague, or share (if appropriate) with students that the conversation is challenging for you. See if you can model respectful disagreement.

## Session Structure

All of the Lesson Plans are designed with a similar structure:

| Objective        | The purpose of each Lesson Plan is indicated. The educator can inform learners of the purpose before starting each activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recommended Time | The activity's recommended length of time. Activities can also be carried out for a longer period if there is time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Materials        | The optional and required materials to carry out the activities in the Lesson Plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Activities       | There are three activities per Lesson Plan. Each activity is 20 minutes each. Each activity has a title, which you may choose to share with the learners. Underneath each activity title are the steps for carrying out the activity. Most of the activities include brief group discussion questions to help guide the discussion on the activity topic. At the end of each activity, there is a Key Message. Emphasize this key message with the learners. |

## Customizing these Lesson Plans to Your Setting

These Lesson Plans provide a structured approach to addressing boys' disengagement from education in fun and participatory ways. However, you may find that some activities are inappropriate for your setting or learners. It will be important to tailor the content of your groups to your context. Use the following questions to inform how you will adapt these Lessons:

- What are the specific challenges boys face with regard to engaging in education?
- What specific skills and support do boys and their peers need to increase their engagement in education?
- What dominant cultural narratives about gender and masculinity are shaping boys' behaviors and attitudes in this context? (For example: narratives centered on militarism, sports dominance, economic success, or sexual conquest.)
- How do local power dynamics related to race, class, caste, ability, ethnicity, or migration status intersect with gender and masculinity to shape boys' experiences in and out of school?
- Are there community leaders, cultural practices, or local stories that could help affirm more liberatory and diverse models of masculinity for boys?
- What kinds of games and popular media are boys and their peers interested in and how can these be incorporated into these lessons?

Depending on the time and resources your educational institution has, you may even want to have an informal discussion with boys and their peers using questions like the above to better understand their needs and challenges.

## Lesson Plans

## Lesson Plan 1: Creating a Caring Space Teaching Tip Sheet

## Hello! You are about to start the first of your Lifting Barriers Classroom Lesson Plan!

The activities in this first Lesson Plan are designed to create a comfortable, safe, and trusting learning environment in a mixed gender setting. These activities will both set the tone and form the foundation for future lessons. To ensure a well-run Lesson, consider practicing the activities with other teachers or even at home.

These Lesson Plans are designed to be used with both girls and boys in mixed gender spaces. However, sometimes separate spaces allow for open sharing, while mixed discussions help build understanding. Before you carry out the first Lesson Plan, decide if you will be able to separate learners into groups by gender, when in the lesson you would do this, and who will support you, if you think it is feasible.

During the activities, keep these Lesson Plans near you so that you do not forget any important steps or discussion questions.

## Other things to keep in mind:

- What is a caring space? A caring space is one where boys and their peers:
- o Feel safe to express their views.
- o Have opportunities to deepen their connections with others, including their teachers.
- o Are able to understand the experiences of others by putting themselves in others' shoes (feel empathy for others).
- Have positive energy. Boys and their peers will be motivated to participate in these lessons if you are also excited to do these lessons.
- When boys feel valued, recognized, and listened to they feel a greater sense of ownership over their education. Throughout the lesson, encourage boys and their peers to contribute their own thoughts and opinions in meaningful ways. See What Is My Role in These Lessons in the section above for more information on this.
- You are not expected to know all the answers , so do not be afraid to say, 'That's an excellent question. I do not know the answer, but I will find out for you.' Write down the question in a place where you will remember it and assure participants that you will find the answer by the next time you meet.

## Preparation

- Review and adapt if needed the Find Someone Who worksheet
- Make copies of the Find Someone Who worksheet, enough for all learners.

Setting Up the Space (Do this for all Lessons!)

- If space allows, have the learners set up chairs in a circle facing in, or have them help you to lay a mat on the floor where everyone can sit in a circle on the floor. Ensure you also have a set at their same level. If space is restricted, review the activities for opportunities to divide learners into smaller discussion groups and then have them share with the wider class.
- Encourage boys, girls, and their peers, regardless of gender, to sit next to someone they do not know very well.

## Lesson Plan 1: Creating a Caring Space

## Lesson Objective

The objective of this Lesson is to create a caring and comfortable space for boys and their peers that will both set the tone and form the foundation for future lessons.

## Total Lesson Plan Time: 1 hour

Activity 1: Introduction to the Lessons (20 minutes)

Activity 2: Group Agreement (20 minutes)

Activity 3: Find Someone Who (20 minutes)

## Recommended Materials

- Pre-prepared flipchart paper with the Group Agreement and a Word Bank. See Activity 2: Creating a Group Agreement on how to set this up.
- Something to write with such as chalk or markers
- Copies of the Find Someone Who worksheet, enough for all learners. This worksheet should be adapted to fit your setting.

## Activity 1 : Introduction to the Lessons (20 minutes)

1. Start with an energizer taking no more than a few minutes. If space allows, split the class into halves or quadrants for group energizers

## Ha, Ha

Begin by having all the learners stand side-by-side. If space is limited, have them stand in front of their seats. Tell all of the learners they have to remain as solemn and serious as they can throughout the game. Pick one learner to start the game, saying 'Ha' once. The learner standing next to him or her says the word 'Ha' twice. Following this pattern, the third learner says 'Ha' three times. As the game progresses, eliminate any learner who laughs or makes noise when it is not their turn. The learner who avoids laughing throughout the game wins.

2. Introduce the Lessons. Say:
2. o Throughout the school year, we will be doing fun activities that make us laugh and think in between our other regular lessons. We will play games, do art, and talk together about issues that affect your education and your lives.
3. Say: We will learn lots of things while doing these activities such as:
4. o How to have good relationships inside and outside the classroom
5. o About gender stereotypes
6. o About the pressures we face in completing education
7. o How to have strong friendships that also help you succeed in school
8. o How to communicate and ask for support
9. o Learning about our emotions
4. Say: These activities will be about helping all learners succeed in school. These lessons are for everybody.

## Activity 2: Creating a Group Agreement (20 minutes)

5. Say that you will work together to create a caring space where everyone feels comfortable to share their opinions while doing these lessons. To do this, you will create a Group Agreement together.
6. Show them the group agreements with blank spaces you have prepared on either a flipchart or chalkboard.
7. Show them the 'Word Bank' you prepared. The 'Word Bank' is a list of words pre-prepared.
8. Ask your learners to help you fill in the blanks. Use the table below as an example.
9. Ask if there are any important group agreements that should be on the paper or board.
10. After everyone agrees, explain that the agreements will remain in place throughout all of the lessons. It is important that these agreements are followed in order for everyone to feel comfortable, safe, and respected.
11. If there is time, have everyone come up and sign their name next to the Group Agreement to show their commitment to creating a caring space.

| Word Bank [Example]   | Group Agreements [Example]                                                                                                                                                     |

Divide learners into small groups and have them create a long list of ways to create a caring space. Whoever has the longest list wins. |

## Activity 3: Find Someone Who (20 minutes)

12. Remind everyone of the purpose of these Lessons. If needed, you can give examples of the types of topics these lessons will explore as listed in Activity 1.
13. Remind everyone of the Group Agreement.
14. Pass out the Find Someone Who worksheet to all learners. Read through each of the sentences to make sure they understand.
15. Ask them to go around the room and fill in the name of someone who fits that description in the left-hand column.
16. After 10 minutes, have all learners sit down in a circle.
17. Ask them a few questions:
- How did it feel to do this activity?
- Did you learn anything new or interesting about your peers you didn't before? What did you learn?
18. Explain that in these lessons they will be learning many new things about how to succeed in school, and doing it in fun ways. These lessons will also be opportunities to make their friendships with their peers even stronger.

## Lesson 2: What is Gender?

## Teaching Tip Sheet

The purpose of this Lesson is to help learners understand how gender socialization begins from the time we are born, and how rigid gender expectations influence and can harm girls and boys differently. Keep these Guiding Ideas in mind as you facilitate these activities:

## Guiding Ideas

- Boys often experience conflicting societal pressures to think and act in strict or narrow definitions of what it means to be a man.
- These are known as gender norms , or society's traditional rules for how men and women should think, act, and behave.
- Gender norms often perpetuate gender inequality where - as a whole - women and girls have less power and privilege in society than men and boys (e.g. boys who have freedom to play outside with friends, while girls must stay home to take care of the household chores). However, though boys and men-as a whole-have more power and privilege, they also experience many restrictions and harm due to these same gender norms.
- Gender norms play a large role in driving boys' disengagement from education. Boys are less likely to transition to secondary school, are more likely to be disciplined harshly in school, and experience physical violence than girls, among other factors. Boys internalize these rules from an early age through gender socialization . Gender socialization is a process during which people learn to 'be' their gender through interacting with their family members, their peers, the media, and other sources around them.
- As you conduct this Lesson, acknowledge the strengths that already exist within each boy (an asset-based approach) as opposed to focusing on what you think they lack. Tap into their creativity, energy and resources so that each boy feels supported to maximize their potential.

## Adapting A Boy's Story - Parts 1 and 2

Before you do the activities, A Boy's Story - Part 1 and 2 in this Lesson, consider adapting any names and situations as necessary to your context.

## Setting Up the Space (Do this for all Lessons!)

- If space allows, have the learners set up chairs in a circle facing in, or have them help you to lay a mat on the floor where everyone can sit in a circle on the floor. Ensure you also have a set at their same level. If space is restricted, review the activities for opportunities to divide learners into smaller discussion groups and then have them share with the wider class.
- Encourage boys, girls, and their peers to sit next to someone they do not know very well.

## Lesson 2: What is Gender?

## Objective

Learners understand how gender socialization begins from the time we are born, and how harmful gender expectations affect girls and boys differently.

## Total Lesson Plan Time: 1 hour

Activity 1: A Boy's Story - Part 1 (20 minutes)

Activity 2: A Boy's Story - Part 2 (20 minutes)

Activity 3: Sharing Circle (20 minutes)

## Materials

- Flipchart paper, or another writeable surface (e.g. chalkboard)
- Something to write with such as chalk or markers

## Activity 1 : A Boy's Story - Part 1 (20 minutes)

1. Tell them you will read a story about a boy. Say, 'Let's give him a name.' Ask learners to pick a name appropriate for the story.
2. Read the following story to your learners:

Once upon a time, a boy named [NAME] was born. He was born needing love and attention from those around him. When he cried, his mother would pick him up from his crib and sing him sweet songs until he fell asleep. Other times, his father would take him in his arms, rock him gently, and give him lots of kisses all over his face.

3. Ask them, how do you think this boy feels when his parents comfort him? Does he feel scared? Or does he feel safe? Why?
4. Continue reading the story:

As the boy grew a little older, he started school. When it was time to play outside, the boy would race his friends to see who could run the fastest. Some of the teachers told the girls to stop running or they would get dirty. So the girls stopped running.

5. Ask the learners:
- What happened to the girls when they raced with the boys when it was time to play? How do you think the girls felt?
6. Continue reading the story:

The next day, the Boy fell down as he started racing his friends. His knee hurt so much he started to cry. His teacher ran over to him and instead of giving him comfort, the teacher told the boy that he wasn't a baby anymore. It was time for him to 'be a man'. So his teacher brushed the dust off his pants and told him to stop crying. So the Boy did.

7. Ask the learners:
- How do you think the boy felt when he hurt himself? How did he feel when his teacher told him not to cry? Have you ever felt like this?
- What other messages do boys receive about how to 'be a man'?
8. Make the following points below and present the definitions. These definitions can be written on the chalk board or on a flipchart paper.
- As we grow up, we receive all kinds of messages from society (e.g. our parents, teachers, the media) about how girls and boys should act and think according to their gender .
- 'Gender' is a word to describe the roles, responsibilities, and qualities (e.g. how you should look, act, think) linked with being, or being seen as a man/boy or woman/girl.
- Throughout our lives, we get messages about how 'men/boys' and 'women/girls' should be. This includes thinking that certain activities are 'natural' or 'normal' for people based on their gender.

'Gender roles' are how boys and girls are expected to act . For example, beliefs that boys and men should be the ones to earn the money, while girls and women stay at home to take care of household chores and children.

- Gender is not biological or natural, but is learned from families, friends, in schools and our communities. Being our gender is something we get to explore and decide for ourselves - everyone can do it their own way.
9. Say that they will discuss more about gender in the next activities.

## Activity 2 : A Boy's Story - Part 2 (20 minutes)

10. Ask learners what they remember about the first part of the Boy's Story. If needed, read the story again, but skip the discussion questions.
11. Read Part 2 of A Boy's Story.

As the Boy grew up, he found that he loved reading and art, but sometimes the other boys and girls would tease him when they saw him reading a book. They said he was 'acting like a girl.' At first, the Boy tried to ignore them, but it made him feel sad. So he stopped reading for fun.

12. Ask the learners, what did the boy stop doing when he was teased? How can this affect his education if he stops reading? Have you ever heard messages like this?
13. Continue reading the final part of the story:
14. After you finish reading, ask the questions:
- Who were the people that the Boy reached out to? What did they tell him to do?
- How did the Boy feel by the end?
15. Share the Key Message:

<!-- image -->

Sometimes, people expect us to act a certain way just because we're a boy or a girl. These pressures can make us feel upset or keep us from doing things we really enjoy. If you ever feel this way, it's okay to talk to a friend or a trusted adult-like me. I'm here to listen and help.

## Activity 3 : Sharing Circle (20 minutes)

15. Have the learners help you to prepare a comfortable space where everyone can sit in a circle.
16. Ask learners what they remember about the Boy's Story. If needed, read the two parts of the story again, but skip the discussion questions.
17. Pass out the handouts as well as pencils / pens to each of the learners in accordance with their gender identity. They can also choose a handout based on what they do not like hearing about other genders (e.g. a girl can choose a handout for boys because they would like to fill out things they do not like boys are told).
18. With the learners, read out the sentences one by one.
19. Tell the learners to complete the sentences in the handouts and that you will not collect them, although you will ask for a few people to share.
20. Give them 5 minutes to fill out the handouts. Go around the room and make sure everyone understands the sentences.
21. After the time is up, ask for all learners to return to the circle and request for a couple volunteers to share what they wrote in their handouts.
22. Thank learners warmly for sharing what was in their handouts.
23. End the activity with a Key Message: We get lots of messages from family, friends, the internet, movies, school, and other places about what boys and girls should or shouldn't like or do. These messages can sometimes make us feel like we can't be ourselves or stop us from trying new things-like certain subjects in school. In the next activities, we'll talk more about this and how we can make our own choices.

## Designer: Please make 3 handouts (one for girls, boys, and nonbinary learners)

| Handout for Boys                                      | Handout for Girls                                       | Handout for Other Learners                           |

## Lesson 3: Gender Stereotypes Teaching Tip Sheet

The purpose of this Lesson is to further explore gender stereotypes and promote empathy amongst students in the classroom. Like it can for girls, gender stereotypes can negatively impact boys' confidence and motivation to do well in school. For example, some parents and teachers believe that girls are naturally better readers and are more inclined to enjoy reading, which can discourage boys from developing the joy of reading. According to UNESCO, 'these stereotypes can have long-lasting effects, as boys internalize these beliefs and become less likely to engage in reading and other academic activities 7 .' There are many benefits to boys when learning environments are free from gender stereotypes such as:

- Improved academic performance - boys would be encouraged to pursue subjects they excel at, without being limited by gender stereotypes.
- Reduced bullying - Boys would feel more accepted and feel less pressure to solve problems with violence.
- Better mental health - Boys would feel higher self-esteem and less likely to experience mental health issues such as with body image.
- More diverse career choices - Boys could be encouraged to explore a wider range of subjects and careers without being limited by gender stereotypes.

Throughout this Lesson, encourage your learners (and yourself!) to challenge gender stereotypes and emphasize the benefits of learning in an environment where they would not feel bound by its restrictions.

## Setting Up the Space

## For the Vote With Your Feet Activities:

Before Activity 1 and Activity 2 begin, hang two pieces of paper on the walls or on the space where your lesson will take place. One should have a 😊 (representing 'I Agree'), and the second should have a ☹ (representing 'I Disagree').

## For the discussion questions:

- If space allows, have the learners set up chairs in a circle facing in, or have them help you to lay a mat on the floor where everyone can sit in a circle on the floor. Ensure you also have a set at their same level. If space is restricted, review the activities for opportunities to divide learners into smaller discussion groups and then have them share with the wider class.
- Encourage boys, girls, and non-binary students to sit next to someone they do not know very well.

## Lesson 3: Gender Stereotypes

## (adapted from Equimundo resources)

## Objective

Learners understand how gender stereotypes can cause harm to their education, and educational aspirations.

## Total Lesson Plan Time: 1 hour

Activity 1: Vote With Your Feet - Part 1 (20 minutes)

Activity 2: Vote With Your Feet - Part 2 (20 minutes)

Activity 3: Imagining My School Without Gender Stereotypes (20 minutes)

## Recommended Materials

- Flipchart paper, or another writeable surface
- Art supplies such as colored paper, markers, paint, or stickers (optional)
- Writing paper and pencils / pens (optional)

## Activity 1 : Vote with Your Feet - Part 1 (20 minutes)

1. Before you start the activity, remind your learners of the Group Agreement they created in Lesson 1. This activity will require them to both debate different opinions and also listen to the perspectives of others.
2. Explain that they will do an activity called 'vote with your feet' where you will read a few statements about gender. Learners will have to debate whether they agree or disagree with the statement by moving to one side of the room or another.
3. Hang up the 'Agree' sign on one side of the space, and the 'Disagree' sign on the other side. Encourage everyone to choose one clear side.

Suggestion: This activity can be hard to manage if you have many learners. If you have a larger class (more than 25 learners), divide them into two groups. Alternate participation as you go through each statement. So, Group 1 will debate the first statement, then Group 2 will debate the second statement, and so on.

4. Read out the following statement to practice:

'Everyone needs 8 hours of sleep a night to feel rested.'

5. Ask all learners to decide whether they 'agree' or 'disagree' with the statement by choosing a side of the space. Do not say whether you personally agree or disagree with the statement. Let your learners share their views. Encourage a lively debate, but

refrain from stating your own opinions or what you think is the 'correct answer'. In some cases, if all the learners choose to 'agree', stand on the other side offering a different perspective and encourage them to debate you.

6. Once you are sure that everyone understands the activity, read out the following statements one at a time. If you are short on time, choose one statement.

Remember, encourage a lively debate by encouraging lots of different perspectives and asking questions, but do not share your own opinions.

- 'Boys are better than girls at math'
- 'Men are better leaders than women'
7. As you read the statement, encourage learners to choose whether they 'agree' or 'disagree' with a statement.
8. After you read one or both statements, sit down. If there's time, ask learners:
- How did it feel to do this activity?
- Have you heard people say things like this before? How does that make you feel?
9. Explain that they just did an activity debating Gender Stereotypes . Many of these are

gender stereotypes created by society. Gender stereotypes is a phrase to describe how society believes a woman/girl or man/boy should be. Stereotypes are harmful because they can limit how well you think you can do in school, what job you might want, and even how you feel about yourself (i.e. self-esteem).

10. Ask if there are any other gender stereotypes about boys and girls in school that they have heard.
11. End with the Key Message:

Gender stereotypes about girls and boys have the potential to cause real harm not only to your education, but also your goals for the future. It is important we all play a role in pushing back against gender stereotypes when we see them.

Say that they will learn more about gender stereotypes in the next activity.

Activity 2: Vote with Your Feet - Part 2 (20 minutes)

12. If you are starting this activity on a different day, refer back to the Group Agreement you created with the learners back in Lesson 1.
13. Once again, facilitate a 'vote with your feet' activity where you will read a few statements about gender roles. Learners will have to debate whether they agree or disagree with the statement by moving to one side of the space or another.
14. Once you are sure that everyone understands the activity, read out the following statements one at a time. If you are short on time, choose one statement.
15. As you read the statement, encourage learners to choose whether they 'agree' or 'disagree' with a statement.

Remember, encourage a lively debate by encouraging lots of different perspectives and asking questions, but do not share your own opinions.

- 'Girls are better behaved than boys'
- 'Girls are nicer than boys'
16. After you read the two statements, sit down. If there's time, ask learners:
- How did it feel to do this activity? Have they heard statements like this before?
- How can thinking 'boys are better than girls at math' and 'girls are better behaved than boys' cause harm to our education?
17. Remind learners that what they just debated during the past two activities were about gender stereotypes .
18. Ask learners: How can gender stereotypes make it difficult for boys to do well in school? What about girls? What about your other peers?
19. End by saying the Key Message.

Gender stereotypes make it difficult for boys, girls, and their peers to do well in school. All learners can play a role in creating a more open and accepting environment where everyone is free to express who they are and what they enjoy.

## Activity 3: Imagining My School Without Gender Stereotypes (20 minutes)

20. Ask participants what they remember about gender stereotypes. Give a few examples of the statements they debated previously, such as 'boys are better leaders than girls' and 'girls are better behaved than boys.'
21. Repeat the main points discussed in the previous activities about how gender stereotypes can harm one's education.
22. Ask, 'What would our school look like if there were no gender stereotypes?' Ask for a few responses. (Examples: Boys would treat others with more kindness, girls would feel braver to be the leader in group activities, boys would feel more comfortable enjoying activities based on their true interests. All of this would lead to a better school environment where all children are happier.)
23. Pass out art supplies such as colored paper, paint, markers, and crayons to each learner.
24. Tell them that they will now draw a picture of what their school would like if there were no gender stereotypes.

Other ideas: Journaling - Learners can write a story about their school where they imagine that there are no gender stereotypes. Make a collage - Learners collaborate on a large piece of art together imagining what their school would look like without gender stereotypes.

25. After about 10 minutes, you can ask a few learners to share.
26. After a few learners share, say how you appreciate how brave they are to share what they drew, and that each learner can play a role in creating a learning environment where boys, girls, and their peers can equally succeed.
27. End with the Key Message:

Without gender stereotypes, boys and their peers can learn without fear of being teased or bullied. We all play a role in challenging gender stereotypes in school and our everyday lives.

## Lesson 4: Learning About Masculinities Teaching Tip Sheet

The purpose of this session is to recognize the challenges boys and girls face in trying to fulfill societal expectations about how to be a 'real man' and 'real woman', understand the negative consequences, and identify positive benefits of becoming more genuine versions of who they would like themselves to be.

On a daily basis, boys and young men receive many restrictive and sometimes contradictory messages on how to be a 'real man.' It is important to understand the pressures boys feel to conform to these unrealistic expectations and the consequences they feel they may face such as bullying, teasing, and even social isolation. At the same time, these rigid expectations have consequences on their education and wider well-being, as described in earlier sections. Learning about different types and representations of men and masculinities (qualities of being a man), can help them to understand the positive and negative ways in which harmful definitions of manhood can impact education and their lives more broadly.

## Setting Up the Space (Do this for all Lessons!)

- If space allows, have the learners set up chairs in a circle facing in, or have them help you to lay a mat on the floor where everyone can sit in a circle on the floor. Ensure you also have a set at their same level. This helps in setting the tone that this is an equal and non-hierarchical space where everyone's opinion matters.
- Encourage boys, girls, and their peers to sit next to someone they do not know very well.

## Total Lesson Plan Time: 1 hour

Activity 1: The Man Box (20 minutes)

Activity 2: The Woman Box (20 minutes)

Activity 3: The Human Space (20 minutes)

## Recommended Materials

- Flipchart paper, or another writeable surface
- Colored tape
- Sticky notes or small pieces of paper
- Markers or something to write with

## Activity 1 : The Man Box (20 minutes)

1. Explain that this activity will focus on gender stereotypes about masculinity - what it means to be a man and how these stereotypes affect boys.
2. Ask the group, 'What are the words or images that come into your mind when people tell you, 'Act like a man!''
3. Encourage them to shout out the answers. Write them down until you get a long list.
4. Say, 'Our society has many expectations for how boys should think and act, especially as they grow older. Some of these expectations are good, but others can be harmful for boys and those they care about.'
5. Break the learners into small groups of 5 - 7 people.
6. Give each small group 10 small pieces of paper, tape and a dark-colored marker.
7. Tell the groups that they will have 3 to 5 minutes to write one message or word on each piece of paper that boys hear every day about how to be a 'real man'. They can use the long list you made at the start of the activity.
8. As they come up with the messages, they must tape the pieces of paper on their bodies (or on just one group member) until they are covered. Whoever has the most pieces of paper wins.
9. As they do the activity, draw a large box on the floor with tape or place a carton large enough to step into on the floor.
10. After 3 to 5 minutes, ask the small groups to come back together and look at the box.
11. Say, 'the box you see in the middle is called 'The Man Box'. The messages young men learn can force them into The Man Box - our society, or culture's, rules for how to be a 'real man'.'
12. Ask one group to step into 'The Man Box' to share the top 3-4 messages they hear. The winning group (the group that has the most pieces of paper) gets to go first. After they present, other groups can contribute messages that haven't yet been shared.
13. Ask everyone to take off the labels / pieces of paper from their bodies and sit back down.
14. Ask, 'how did it feel to do this activity?'
15. Say, it can feel like a relief to realize that many of us dislike getting these kinds of messages. We are all experiencing the same pressures to live up to gender stereotypes .
16. Ask, 'Where do we hear these messages for how to be a man? Who says these messages?'
17. Say that:
- Boys face a lot of pressure from family (e.g. to drop out of school to earn money and support the family), peer pressure from their male friends (e.g. to bully others, not focus on school), from social media influencers (e.g. perpetuate harmful stereotypes), and other places to act like a 'real' man.
- Many of these beliefs can limit boys' potential to succeed not only in school, but in life.
18. Ask, what are the consequences when boys feel forced to fit into this Man Box? For example, they can feel sad, angry, or depressed; it can affect their ability to focus on school.
19. Brainstorm the benefits of stepping outside the Man Box. What are the positive things that would happen if boys decided they did not want to live in this box? For example, they would feel free to express their feelings, or be involved in activities that they are interested in without worrying about being teased.
20. After the activity is over, save the work learners did to make it easier to review at the beginning of the next activity. You can re-create the Man Box on a separate flipchart paper and re-tape the messages or words inside the box.

## Activity 2 : The Woman Box (20 minutes)

21. If you are doing this activity on a different day, ask learners what they remember about the Man Box. Use the Man Box flipchart or sticky notes you saved to help them remember.
22. Explain that this activity will focus on gender stereotypes about femininity - what it means to be a woman and how these stereotypes affect girls.
23. Ask the group, 'What are the words or images that come into your mind when people tell you, 'Act like a woman!''
24. Encourage them to shout out the answers. Write them down until you get a long list.
25. Say, 'Our society has many expectations for how girls and young women should think and act, especially as they grow older. Some of these expectations are good, but others can be harmful for girls and those they care about.'
26. Break the learners into small groups of 5 - 7 people.
27. Give each small group 10 small pieces of paper, tape and a dark-colored marker.
28. Tell the groups that they will have 3 to 5 minutes to write one message or word on each piece of paper that girls hear every day about how to be a 'real woman'. They can use the long list you made at the start of the activity.
29. As they come up with the messages, they must tape the pieces of paper on their bodies (or on just one group member) until they are covered. Whoever has the most pieces of paper wins.
30. As they do the activity, draw a large box on the floor with tape.
31. After 3 to 5 minutes, ask the small groups to come back together and form a circle around the box you have drawn on the floor.
32. The box you see in the middle is called 'The Woman Box'. The messages young girls learn can force them into The Woman Box - our society, or culture's, rules for how to be a 'real woman'.
33. Ask each group to take turns stepping into 'The Woman Box' to share the top 3-4 messages they hear. The winning group (the group that has the most pieces of paper) gets to go first. Every group after should share messages that previous groups have not yet shared.
34. Once every group has gone, ask everyone to take off the labels / pieces of paper from their bodies and sit down in a circle.
35. Ask, 'How did it feel to do this activity?'
36. Say, like it is for boys, it can feel like a relief to realize that many girls dislike getting these kinds of messages. Many women and girls are experiencing the same pressures to live up to gender stereotypes .
37. Ask, the boys, did you learn anything that you were surprised about regarding the messages girls receive?
38. Say that like boys, girls also feel pressure from family (e.g. to spend more time on house chores than school work), peers (e.g. teasing, pressure to be quiet), and other places to act like a 'real' woman. Many of these beliefs can limit girls' potential to succeed not only in school, but in life.
39. Brainstorm the benefits of stepping outside the Woman Box. What are the positive things that would happen to girls if they decided they did not want to live in this box?
40. After the activity is over, save the work learners did to make it easier to review at the beginning of the next activity. You can re-create the Woman Box on a separate flipchart paper and re-tape the messages or words inside the box.

## Activity 3 : The Human Space (20 minutes)

41. If you are doing this activity on a different day, ask learners what they remember about the Man Box and Woman Box. Use the Man and Woman Boxes you saved to help them remember.
42. Draw a big box on a flipchart paper or on a visible writing surface like a chalkboard. Inside, write 'My Human Space.'
43. Tell everyone to imagine that there was no Man or Woman Box. In other words, no pressure from society on how to be a man or woman. Think of a world where you were expected to be simply human and to treat others as equals.
44. Ask them what types of qualities they would like to see in this 'Human Space' what messages or qualities would they like to have or hear from others about how to be human?
45. Write down the qualities as your learners shout them out or raise their hands.

Tip: Alternatively, you can make this an individual activity. Pass out paper and pencils and ask them to draw a large box on the paper called 'My Human Space.' Tell them to write inside all the qualities they would like to have or hear from others about how to be a human. After 5 minutes, you can ask a few learners to share their responses with the rest of the group.

46. Ask the group the following reflection questions:
- How can the positive qualities inside your Human Box help you in school? How about in your life more broadly?
- What help might you need from others in your life to live out these qualities in the Human Space?

## 47. End with the Key Message

A person, regardless of their gender or sex, can be any combination of characteristics inside the Human Space. Every person should be able to decide for themselves the kind of human they want to be. It should not be forced upon us because of our gender.

## Lesson 5: Succeeding In School Teaching Tip Sheet

The purpose of this session is to support boys and their peers by building their time management skills to have more time to both study and have fun. Unlike other Lessons, this is not purely about gender and masculinities. It is a lesson to help boys, girls, and their peers build time management skills. For this reason, this lesson can be done at any point in the school year.

Boys often report feeling overwhelmed once they perceive that they have fallen behind their peers and believe they are unable to catch up. This can form patterns of behavior where boys perceive that higher education is unnecessary or too challenging to pursue. Educators like you can intervene early by encouraging them to develop good practices. Boys respond well to tailored practical solutions that will help them to overcome barriers to their learning.

This session focuses on helping them to develop a daily and weekly schedule to better manage their time. However, if you identify different roadblocks to boys' education, adapt the session to build boys' skills to overcome that challenge. For example, boys may have issues with regular school attendance, or in finding the motivation to complete homework by setting deadlines. In your adaptation, keep the learning light, fun, and offer lots of encouragement. In addition, link boys with other learning support services such as academic counselors and tutors. You can even invite a young man enrolled in university to your classroom to talk about their experiences, what they did to get enrolled, and more.

## Preparation for Activity 3 - My Daily Schedule

In Activity 3 - My Daily Schedule, you will be asked to share your daily schedule. Create one that is close to your real one, or you can imagine one with different activities. The purpose is to show learners how to create their own schedules and how it is possible to balance activities you like to do ('WANT TO's') with things you are responsible for and are sometimes less fun ('HAVE TO's.')

## Setting Up the Space (Do this for all Lessons!)

- If space allows, have the learners set up chairs in a circle facing in, or have them help you to lay a mat on the floor where everyone can sit in a circle on the floor. Ensure you also have a set at their same level. This helps in setting the tone that this is an equal and non-hierarchical space where everyone's opinion matters.
- Encourage boys, girls, and non-binary students to sit next to someone they do not know very well.

## Lesson 5: Succeeding In School

## Objective

The purpose of this session is to support boys and their peers by building their time management skills to have more time to both study and have fun.

## Total Lesson Plan Time: 1 hour

Activity 1: Setting A Goal (20 minutes)

Activity 2: Want To's and Have To's (20 minutes)

Activity 3: Make a Daily Schedule (20 minutes)

## Materials

- Flipchart paper, or another writeable surface
- Paper and pens / pencils for writing
- Optional: colored paper, paint, markers, and crayons
- Your Daily Schedule written on a piece of flipchart paper
- Copies of the Daily Schedule at the end of this Lesson enough for all learners

## Activity 1: Setting Goals (20 minutes)

1. Explain that this activity will focus on setting goals.
2. Ask the learners, 'What is a goal?'
3. Say: A goal is something you want to achieve.
4. Say that everyone wishes to have goals such as finishing your grade with good marks, or make new friends in school this year. To do well in school, it is important to have goals because it helps us to develop a plan we can follow. It is something you want to achieve or accomplish in a specific amount of time like in a month, several months, or a year.
5. Ask the learners to lie down or sit quietly on the ground. Tell them to close their eyes and take a deep breath.
6. Tell them: Imagine themselves in the next 1 to 2 years.
- How are you doing in school?
- Are you doing any after school activities that excite you?
- What have you achieved in school that you are most proud of?
7. Tell them to open their eyes.
8. Tell them to get out a piece of paper and a pen or pencil for writing or drawing.
9. Explain that they will write down or draw what is their goal for school in the next 1 to 2 years. They should title the paper: 'My School Goal.' Optional: Pass out art supplies such as colored paper, paint, markers, and crayons to each learner.
10. Remind the learners that these should be visions of what they want for themselves, and not what someone else may desire for them.
11. After 5 minutes, ask for a few volunteers (3 or 4) to share what their goals are for school.
12. Thank the learners for sharing. Say that it is important that they have goals for school because it will help them stay focused.
13. If you have the space, you can have the learners tape up their goals on a wall where they can see them.

## Activity 2 : Want To's and Have To's (20 minutes)

1. Remind the learners that they learned about setting goals in the last activity. Say that in this activity they will talk about the things they can do every day to help achieve those goals.
2. Ask the learners to think about all the fun things they do in a day, from when they wake up to when they go to sleep. Remind them to also think of fun things like talking with friends, phone calls/chats with family members, and volunteering in the community.
3. After thinking silently to themselves for 1 minute, ask them to shout out their ideas to you.
4. As they share, write what they tell you on flipchart paper or another visible surface like a chalkboard.
5. Thank them for sharing the things they do each day. Say it is good to have time to do fun things like talking with friends and playing games. These are 'WANT TO's.' But we also have responsibilities that are important to help us do well in school, keep ourselves healthy, and help others. These are 'HAVE TO's'. For example, help clean up at home, do our school work, eat, and sleep.
6. Say that every day they have to choose between activities they want to do and activities they have to do.

'WANT TO's' are activities you want to do because you enjoy them.

'HAVE TO's' are activities you must do because they are necessary or important, even if you don't like them or want to do them.

7. Look at the activities on the flipchart. Let's now decide which ones you WANT TO DO and which ones you HAVE TO DO.
8. Go through the list of activities from the flipchart and ask the entire group to say which activities they think are WANT TO's or HAVE TO's. You may call on volunteers or ask the boys to shout out answers.
9. Mark them with two different colors to show the difference between WANT TO's (one color) and HAVE TO's (second color).
10. When the learners disagree, ask them to explain why the activity is either a WANT TO or HAVE TO, and ask the group to make a decision together. Mark the activity with the appropriate color.
11. Emphasize that WANT TO's are important because they make us happy. However, it is important to balance the WANT TO's with the HAVE TO's so that we can achieve our school goals and become successful in life.

## Activity 3 : My Daily Schedule (20 minutes)

12. Tell the learners that they plan their day. Say you give them a handout in a moment to help them turn all of their activities into a daily schedule. First, show them an example of their day. Then they can think about planning their own.
13. Post the flipchart of your schedule and explain it to the boys. Show which activities are ones you want to do and which ones you have to do.

## Tip on Creating Your Daily Schedule:

- When you create your daily schedule to share with the participants, include activities that represent things you HAVE TO do and WANT TO do.
- You can explain that some things, teaching them is part of your job, so you have to do it, but you also want to do it!
- You can enjoy many activities you have to do, like going to school or going to the market to buy fruit for the family.
- Create a schedule that is close to your real one, or you can imagine one with different activities.
- The purpose is to show the learners how to create their own schedules and show how it is possible to balance the WANT TO's with the HAVE TO's.
14. Pass out the handout 'Making My Daily Schedule' to the learners. Guide them through the handout as you explain the activity.
15. Ask them to work individually to create daily schedules. They should pick a day during the week when they have school.
16. Just like your example, they should fill in their schedules from when they wake up until they go to sleep, and make sure there is some balance, where possible, between activities they WANT  TO do and HAVE TO do. The learners can choose which activities will fit in their schedules.
17. Give the learners 5 minutes to work on their schedules.

Note : This will not be enough time for them to finish their daily schedules. That's okay! The important thing is that they now have a tool they can use in their daily lives to help them better manage their time.

18. Ask them the following questions:
- What is one thing you learned today about how to better manage your time?
- With whom in your family will you share your daily schedule?

## Optional Activity: My Weekly Schedule (20 minutes)

Create a handout called 'Making My Weekly Schedule' to fill out either as homework or in another Lesson. See the example at the end of this lesson. They can use the Daily Schedule they created as a guide to help them fill out a weekly schedule.

## Key Messages

- Making a simple plan or schedule can help you manage your time-especially when life feels busy with school and other things.
- As you get older, people may expect you to do more and more things every day. It might start to feel like everything is something you have to do.
- But it's also really important to make time for things that make you happy. Finding a good balance between work and fun helps you feel your best and enjoy life.

## MY DAILY SCHEDULE

## Lesson Plan 6: Understanding My Emotions

## Teaching Tip Sheet

The purpose of this lesson is to explore the importance of feeling and positively expressing all types of emotions.

Boys can feel ashamed to discuss and share feelings as this can be perceived as a sign of personal weakness. This is because boys tend to view emotions as binary (e.g. crying is for girls, anger and feeling brave is for boys), when in fact everyone shares these emotions. Throughout this session, empower boys and their peers to better articulate their emotions beyond their current comfort levels and acknowledge the difficulties boys face in expressing certain emotions. Boys who are struggling with their mental health benefit from having a safe space where they can explore the positives of expressing one's emotions and valuing their mental health. Work with your school to identify mental health resources that boys' and their peers can use both inside (e.g. school counselors) and out of school (e.g. NGO's providing mental health services to youth).

Boys who have more positive mental health are better able to 8 :

- Have an increased understanding of the factors impacting their mental and emotional health
- Have more self-awareness regarding the source of their own stress triggers, fears, and anxieties
- Identify and reach out to educational support and mental health services
- Be resilient and better able to communicate how they feel to others, especially when they need help.

## Setting Up the Space (Do this for all Lessons!)

- If space allows, have the learners set up chairs in a circle facing in, or have them help you to lay a mat on the floor where everyone can sit in a circle on the floor. Ensure you also have a set at their same level. This helps set the tone that this is an equal and non-hierarchical space where everyone's opinion matters.
- Encourage boys, girls, and non-binary students to sit next to someone they do not know very well.

8 Taking Boys' Seriously Principles by Ulster University

## Lesson 6: Understanding My Emotions

## (from Equimundo/En Avant Toutes resources)

## Objective

Explore the importance of feeling and positively expressing all types of human emotions.

## Total Lesson Plan Time: 1 hour

Activity 1: Flashcards of Emotions (20 minutes)

Activity 2: Making My Mask of Emotions (20 minutes)

Activity 3: Sharing Circle (20 minutes)

## Recommended Materials

- A printed deck of cards that contain images of students' favorite characters (e.g. anime characters, cartoon characters, movie stars, or influencers) expressing a range of different emotions (e.g. happy, in love, worried, irritated). Alternatively, these images can also be shown on a mobile phone, or hand drawn on pieces of paper ahead of the class.
- Copies of the My Mask of Emotions (at the end of this lesson) one for each participant
- Optional: Scissors for cutting out the masks (or cut them out ahead of time)
- Optional: Art supplies for decorating the mask (e.g. paint, markers, colored paper, stickers)
- Optional: Flipchart paper and markers

## Activity 1: Flashcards of Emotions (20 minutes)

1. Tell the learners they will learn about expressing emotions.
2. Take out the deck of cards and put them on a table next to you. Pick up the first card and show it to the learners.
3. Ask, 'What emotion do you think this character is feeling?' Use the box below for examples of different emotions. Tip : You can have this chart written out on the board or flipchart paper.
4. Write the emotion everyone agrees on the board or flipchart paper.
5. Keep pulling out different cards and writing down the emotions on the board.
6. Stop when you have a good list of 10-15 different emotions.
7. Observe that the emotions on each of the cards are often very exaggerated. Ask, 'Why is this?' Get a few responses. (Example response: They need to show strong emotions so the audience knows how they feel).
8. Ask, 'Why don't we express emotions like these characters in everyday life?' Get a few responses. (Example response: Maybe it's hard to show emotions because it makes other people uncomfortable).
9. Ask, 'Are there certain emotions that are considered 'feminine' emotions and others considered 'masculine emotions' Which ones?' Get a few responses.
10. Say that as humans, we all experience a wide range of emotions, but gender stereotypes and pressure from society often limit how we express emotions to others. Over the next couple activities, you will continue exploring emotions.

| Happy        | Sad          | Fear      | Angry      | Others      |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Love         | Heartbroken  | Worried   | Annoyed    | Admiration  |
| Relief       | Disappointed | Doubtful  | Frustrated | Awkwardness |
| Contentment  | Hopeless     | Anxious   | Bitter     | Romance     |
| Amusement    | Lost         | Nervous   | Infuriated | Desire      |
| Joy          | Troubled     | Terrified | Irritated  | Surprise    |
| Pride        | Miserable    | Horrified | Mad        | Awe         |
| Excitement   |              | Confused  | Cheated    |             |
| Peace        |              | Stressed  | Vengeful   |             |
| Satisfaction |              |           | Insulted   |             |

## Activity 2: Making My Mask of Emotions (20 minutes)

11. Ask or remind participants of what they discussed in the last activity. Say that this activity will continue exploring the expression of emotions.
12. Pass out copies of the mask to every learner, and art supplies if available.
13. Explain that the outer part of the mask is the face they show to the world. They can write the emotions they show to the outside world. Tip : If you prepared a written list of emotions on a flipchart paper (from Activity 1: Flashcard of Emotions), display it again so the learners have a list of emotions from which they can pull ideas.
14. Explain that the inside part of the mask is all the emotions they hide inside the mask (emotions they do not express to others).
15. Say that they will not have to share what they wrote in their masks today. Give them the rest of the time in this activity to complete their mask.
16. Make sure they write their names somewhere on their masks. Collect all the masks before the end of the activity.

## Activity 3: Sharing Circle (20 minutes)

17. Say that this activity will  continue the learning about emotions.
18. Pass out the masks back to the learners. If needed, you can give them a couple extra minutes to remind themselves of what they wrote inside and outside their masks.
19. Pair up learners into groups of 2 or 3. Ask them to share with their peers what they wrote inside and outside their masks.
20. After a few minutes of sharing in pairs or small groups, ask them to return to the larger circle with their masks.
21. Ask the group the following questions:
- What emotions are easier for boys to express? What is harder?
- What emotions are easier for girls and non-binary learners to express? What is harder?
- What happens when we can't express our full range of emotions?
- What would be the benefits if everyone, regardless of their gender, could all their emotions in healthy ways?
22. Close with the following Key Messages:
- In general, boys and men in particular are taught by society not to talk about feelings such as sadness and frustration because they worry it will make them look weak or vulnerable.
- Very often, by not talking, the frustration or anger builds up until it is expressed through physical aggression or shouting, or cause boys to shut down and not ask for help when they need it.
- On the other hand, while girls are often more free to express some emotions, they might be discouraged from expressing anger.
- Feeling free to express a range of human emotions can make everyone happier.

## Lesson Plan 7: Ending Bullying Behavior

## Teaching Tip Sheet

The main purpose of this lesson is to explore with boys' and their peers' their feelings of having power and feeling powerless, and its connections to bullying. Bullying has been defined as 'unwanted, aggressive behaviour among school-aged children that involves a real or perceived imbalance of power. The behaviour is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time'. 9 Bullying is a form of school violence and can overlap with many other forms of violence such as corporal punishment, sexual abuse, assault, cyberbullying, physical fighting, and psychological violence such as insults and social exclusion.

Both boys and girls experience bullying, however the types of bullying they experience may differ based on their gender. Research shows that boys are more likely to be exposed to physical bullying and to physical violence in general, while girls are more likely to report experiencing psychological and sexual violence. Boys are also more likely to experience corporal punishment in school. Students who are perceived not to conform to prevailing sexual and gender norms, including those who are lesbian, gay,  bisexual or transgender (LGBT), are also more vulnerable to many types of school bullying. 10

There are many drivers behind school violence and bullying and they include unequal and restrictive gender and social norms, and wider contextual and structural factors. Much school violence and bullying is related to gender because they reinforce differential power status whereby boys, for example, may feel pressure to show dominance, strength, or control. Girls may be judged for appearance or behavior that challenges traditional expectations. The most vulnerable children and adolescents, including those who are poor or from ethnic, linguistic or cultural minorities or migrant or refugee communities or have disabilities, are at higher risk of school violence and bullying. Children and adolescents whose sexual orientation, gender identity or expression does not conform to traditional social or gender norms are also disproportionately affected.

- This is a sensitive session during which many participants may share examples from their own life of how they have been bullied or experienced other forms of violent behavior.
- Take care to remind participants of the group agreement, especially the parts about respect and kindness.
- Be careful that you do not ask directly if someone has experienced bullying or other forms of violence, or if they have bullied others as this can make learners feel forced to answer. As the educator, you have more power than others in the classroom. When discussing experiences of bullying or feeling powerless, explore these questions more generally (e.g. 'What do boys think about … ' 'What do girls think about … ') rather than asking about personal experiences.
- Review your mandatory reporting requirements. Know what to do if a learner discloses that they have experienced violence during the session.
- Above all, listen to the learners with an open heart and do your best to maintain a safe and caring atmosphere.

## Setting Up the Space (Do this for all Lessons!)

- If space allows, have the learners set up chairs in a circle facing in, or have them help you to lay a mat on the floor where everyone can sit in a circle on the floor. Ensure you also have a set at their same level. This helps sets the tone that this is an equal and non-hierarchical space where everyone's opinion matters.
- Encourage boys, girls, and non-binary students to sit next to someone they do not know very well.

## Lesson 7: Ending Bullying Behavior

## (adapted from Equimundo resources)

## Objective

The main purpose of this lesson is for learners to explore their feelings of powerlessness, the consequences of bullying, and develop confidence to seek support and find solutions.

## Total Lesson Plan Time: 1 hour

Activity 1: Exploring Power (20 minutes)

Activity 2: Emanuel's Story (20 minutes)

Activity 3: Solutions to End Bullying (20 minutes)

## Materials

- Flipchart paper, or another writeable surface
- Markers or something else to write with

## Activity 1: Exploring Power (20 minutes)

1. Say that today you will all do a fun activity about power.
2. Divide the participants into two groups and line them up on each side of an imaginary line. Each side should have the same number of participants so that everyone has a partner.
3. Choose one group to be the 'Persons' and one group to be the 'Things.'
4. Read the following instructions to the group:

Things: You cannot think, feel, or make decisions. You have to do what the Person tells you. If you want to move or do something, you have to ask the Person for permission.

Persons: You can think, feel, and make decisions. You can also tell the Thing what to do with hand gestures or words. NO physical touch.

Important: Consider asking two participants to demonstrate how a Person might treat a Thing before starting the role-play.

5. Have the participants switch roles and let them role-play for another 2 minutes.
6. Ask participants to sit back down in the circle and ask the following questions:
- When you were the Things, how did your Person treat you? How did you feel?
- When you were the Persons, how did you treat your Things? How did it feel to treat them as an object?
- What bad things can happen in school when we treat others like Things (e.g. anger and violence such as bullying in school, feeling depressed or disconnected from school)?
- One way people treat others like Things is through bullying. Why do you think bullying happens?

## 7. Say:

- People who bully others use their power - such as physical strength, access to embarrassing information, or popularity to control or harm others . This creates an unsafe learning environment for everyone.
- People often learn these bullying behaviors from the world around them-like when adults, our friends or even our schools show that being 'tough' or 'in charge' is what matters most.
- Everyone deserves to feel safe and respected at school.
8. End the activity by saying they will explore bullying more in the next activity.

## Activity 2: Emanuel's Story  (20 minutes)

9. Say that in the last activity, learners learned how power is used by people to bully others. Use the key points below to expand upon this.

## Gender and Bullying Behavior

- Bullying happens when there is an imbalance of power or strength between people. Many times, bullying is used to control others and show that they are strong or powerful.
- Boys, girls, and all children regardless of gender identity can experience bullying in and out of school.
- There is no one specific cause for bullying. Rather, bullying happens because of multiple causes put together like unequal power between groups, the wider school environment, and what we learn in the wider world around us.
- Many people think that boys are 'naturally' violent - that it is in their biology. But this is not true. Violence is a learned behavior.
- -For example, a boy may have seen his father use violence against his mother when he was a child and learned that this is a normal way to treat a partner in a relationship.
- If violence is learned then it can also be un-learned.
- People who are bullied have the right to receive support and be helped to get out of the situation.
- People who bully also need support to understand their harmful behavior and stop it. Often, those who bully are acting out of pain or problems they don't know how to deal with.
10. Say that you will read them a short story about a boy called Emanuel.

Emanuel is 13 and goes to school in a small village. His mother sells vegetables at the market, and his father works away from home. One day, Emanuel comes to school wearing old shoes that are falling apart. Some of the boys and girls in his class start teasing him, calling him 'poor boy' and laughing when he walks past.

Every day, the jokes get louder. One boy, Musa, starts pushing Emanuel's chair when the teacher isn't looking. The other boys laugh because Musa is popular and is good at sports.

Their teacher notices but doesn't say much. She has sixty students and does not have time to address every bad behavior. She thinks boys should learn to stick up for themselves.

11. Pause the story and ask:
- What are the reasons the boys tease Emanuel? How do you think he feels?
- Why do you think the teacher does not stop the teasing?

## 12. Continue reading the story:

At home, when Emanuel finally has the courage to tell his mother what is happening at school, she tells him to stand up to the boys like a 'real man' or he'll be seen as weak.

A few weeks later, a new student joins the class. His name is Samuel. He is quiet and smaller than the others. When Musa and his friends start teasing Samuel, Emanuel laughs along and starts calling Samuel names too. For the first time, he feels like he belongs. Deep down, he remembers how it felt when everyone laughed at him - but now, being part of the group feels safer than being their target.

13. Ask the group:
- Emanuel's mother tells him to stand up to the boys like a 'real man.' What do you think she is trying to tell him? Is this good advice? Why or why not?
- What happens when Samuel joins the class?
- Why do you think Emanuel chooses to also bully Samuel?
14. End the activity by saying that bullying happens for a lot of different reasons. There is no one specific cause. Bullying causes real harm because it harms everyone's ability to learn and have fun in school!

## Activity 3: Solutions to End Bullying (20 minutes)

15. Re-read all of Emanuel's Story to the group, but do not repeat the questions.
16. Ask the group to remember the reasons why Emanuel decides to bully Samuel. For example:
- Musa bullies Emanuel because he believes he is poor.
- His mother tells Emanuel to solve his problems like a 'real man'
- The teacher is too busy and does not think bullying is their problem to solve.
- Emanuel does not have friends who stand up for him.
- Emanuel maybe feels sad and angry.
- Emanuel wants to fit in with the other boys.
17. Tell the group there is no single reason why Emanuel bullies Samuel. It is a combination of different factors!
18. Tell the group that you think the story should have a different ending where Emanuel stands up for Samuel when is bullied.
19. Write 'Emanuel stands up for Samuel' on the board and write down the learners' responses to the questions.
20. Ask the group, what kinds of support does Emanuel need to support Samuel?
- From his friends?
- Example: Friends that set a good example by standing up for Emanuel when he is bullied.
- From his teachers?
- Example: A teacher who is supportive of students who are bullied and has clear, written rules.
- From his parents?
- Example: A parent who will help Emanuel find a peaceful solution.
- From his school?
- Example: A school that has campaigns about kindness and respect.
21. If there is time, ask the students to imagine what will happen when there is a more supportive environment for Emanuel and his friends to stand up against bullying. Examples include:
- Samuel and other students feel safer at school
- Everyone feels safe to learn
- Friendships become stronger
- Teachers are happier because everyone is getting along
22. Ask the learners to think of at least 1 action they can put into practice now to help prevent bullying from happening in their environment. If short on time, consider assigning this as a homework assignment.
23. End with the key message: Bullying in school makes it hard to learn, play, and just enjoy being with our friends, but it does not have to be this way. We can all play a role in changing our school together!

| Educator Tip: Standing up to rumors, bullying and other forms of harassment is important, but youth also have to be safe. These are things they should not do:   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ● Never react with violence or too much force such as shouting or being angry. This can escalate the situation.                                                  |
| ● Never intervene if they think there is a risk of violence. Instead, it's important that they tell a trusted adult to help.                                     |
| ● Never intervene if it will affect the health and safety of the person being harassed. In this case, it is important to bring in trusted adults who can help.   |

## Lesson Plan 8: Communication - Asking for Help Teaching Tip Sheet

The purpose of this lesson is to understand why it is important to communicate when boys are struggling, especially in school, and how to do so effectively.

Throughout this lesson, emphasize that asking for help when struggling academically is a sign of strength - not weakness - because they are taking the lead in getting the support they need from those around them. There are many benefits when boys and their peers ask for help with school such as immediate improvement in their understanding of the subject, increased confidence in their ability to learn new things, and the prevention of having academic issues escalate by addressing the problem early on. As their educator, encourage boys - and all your learners- to reach out to you when they are struggling with a particular subject. Emphasize that you care deeply about their well-being and wish to see them succeed.

Just as it's important for boys to ask for help when they need it, they should also recognize that they are capable of supporting others. Whether it's through collaborative learning, listening to a friend, or offering encouragement, boys can play an active role in creating a supportive environment where everyone feels comfortable seeking and giving help. Using an asset-based approach, encourage boys and their peers to offer help to their friends when they see they are struggling or need support.

Outside of the learning space, establish links between schools, caregivers / parents, local community groups, school support committees, and local education authorities who can all work together to address the challenges boys face in succeeding academically.

## Setting Up the Space (Do this for all Lessons!)

- If space allows, have the learners set up chairs in a circle facing in, or have them help you to lay a mat on the floor where everyone can sit in a circle on the floor. Ensure you also have a set at their same level. This helps sets the tone that this is an equal and non-hierarchical space where everyone's opinion matters.
- Encourage boys, girls, and non-binary students to sit next to someone they do not know very well.

## Lesson Plan 8: Communication - Asking for Help

## Objective

The purpose of this lesson is to understand why it is important to communicate when boys are struggling, especially in school, and how to do so effectively.

## Total Lesson Plan Time: 1 hour

Activity 1: Charades! (20 minutes)

Activity 2: Role-Play Brainstorm (20 minutes)

Activity 3: Let's Act It Out Role-Plays (20 minutes)

## Recommended Materials

Flipchart and markers (optional) Pieces of paper and a pen

## Activity 1: Charades! (20 minutes)

1. Tell the learners they will learn about the importance of communication to do well in school.
2. Explain that they will play a game called 'Charades.' Say that a volunteer will come to the center of the circle and you will whisper a word in their ear. This volunteer will then act out the word in front of the group without using any words or sounds. It is also not allowed to point at the item if they see it in the learning space. The rest of the learners can shout out the word they think the volunteer is acting out.
3. Use the box below for ideas on what the learners can act out.
4. Get several volunteers to act out the various words or actions.
5. Ask the following questions for learners to reflect on the activity:
- What was the hardest part of doing this activity? Example: We couldn't use our words to tell others what we were acting out.
- In real life, why is it hard for boys to ask for help? What about girls?
- What happens when we do not communicate with others when we need help, especially in school?
2. Tell learners that sometimes it is difficult to ask for help because we are worried about looking weak or being judged. However, every learner needs support from their family, their friends, their teachers, and others to do well in school. In order to get this support, it is important we reach out and communicate what help we need.
3. Continue by saying that it's also important that friends are also there for one another, and are ready to encourage one another to do well.

| Animals ● Mouse ● Elephant ● Snake ● Fish ● Chicken   | Sports ● Scoring a goal ● Swimming ● Riding a bicycle   | Other Actions ● Soothing a crying baby ● Washing hair ● Mopping the floor ● Listening to music ● Playing a specific musical instrument   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Activity 2: Role-Play Brainstorm (20 minutes)

4. Ask participants what they remember from the last activity they did on communication. Say it is important to ask for help from caring adults because they can help us overcome all kinds of problems we may face in school.
5. Tell participants to close their eyes. Ask them to think of typical problems learners in their year have in school (e.g. confusion with a school subject, a problem with a friend, getting to school on time) but it must be school-related.
6. As they think for a minute or two, prepare a chart that looks like this:
7. Ask learners to share what they thought about. Get a long list. Write down their ideas under 'Situation' until you have a long list (5-7 scenarios)
8. Ask learners who are the caring adults or peers they can go to when they are having a problem (e.g. mother, father, older sister, math teacher, coach, a friend) until you have a long list.
9. Ask learners, what can they say to ask for help? This might be the hardest one for learners to answer. Use the table below to help spark ideas, and write down their ideas as well.
10. Your table might look like this:
11. Tell learners that they will come up with a role-play in the next activity on how to ask for help from a caring adult using a situation from the list they created together.
12. Save the brainstormed ideas to do Activity 3!
13. Close the activity by making the following points:
- Sometimes it is difficult to ask for help because you might feel ashamed or embarrassed. This is normal.
- As your teacher, I want to see you succeed in school. If you ever need help, I am here.

| Situation   | Caring Adult or Peer   | Ways to Ask for Help   |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|

| Situation                                                                                   | Caring Adults or Peers                                   | Ways to Ask for Help                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - A boy feels worried about the upcoming math test because he does not understand fractions | - Father - Mother - Coach - A good friend - Older sister | ● I'm struggling with _____. Can we talk about it later? ● I'm working hard, but I'm still not |

| - A boy is worried about the bully who always bothers him on the way to school   | - Teacher   | understanding _____. Can you help me? ● I'm not sure what I need. Can you please talk with me? ● Can you give me advice about _____?   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Activity 3:  Let's Act It Out - Role-Play (20 minutes)

| To prepare this activity, do the following:   | To prepare this activity, do the following:                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                               | - Have two plastic bags or another type of small container                                                                                  |
|                                               | - In one bag, write down the scenarios your learners brainstormed in Activity 2 on small pieces of paper (one scenario per piece of paper). |
|                                               | - In the second bag, write down the caring adult your learners brainstormed on small pieces of paper, one adult per piece of paper          |

14. Remind learners of what they did in the last activity. Say that today they will prepare role plays on how to ask for help.
15. Have them sit in a circle together. Select or ask for 2 volunteers.
16. Reach into the first bag and select a scenario that the pair must act out. Reach into the second bag and select the caring adult from whom they will ask help. Give them one minute to discuss how they will act out the scenario.
17. Ask the volunteers to do their role-play.
18. Give the volunteers a big thank you and acknowledge their bravery for being the first to go.
19. Ask the group: How did the learner ask for help in this scenario? What other things could they have said?
20. Ask for the next pair of volunteers and repeat the steps.
21. After you have gone through a few scenarios, ask the learners:
- What can you do starting today to get the support you need from caring adults and your friends?
22. Close with a key message: Caring people are all around you. To get support, they need you to let them know when you need help. Asking for help requires strength! It requires us to admit when we do not have all the answers. This is an important skill to have. At the same time, it is also important that you also offer help to others when you see your friends need it! This is what good friends do!

## Lesson 9: Friendships and Changing Relationships Teaching Tip Sheet

The main purpose of this lesson is to help learners analyze how friends can positively or negatively influence their educational success in a fun, interactive way.

Young boys in upper primary school are at a delicate age where peer expectations, gender norms, formal and informal social networks (such as sports associations), and social support systems can positively or negatively influence their participation and progression in education, as well as their learning outcomes. Boys are capable of forming strong friendships that provide emotional support, navigate the complexity of getting older, help them build self-confidence, foster a sense of belonging, and teach important social skills like communication and cooperation. All of this can contribute to boys' overall well-being and academic success.

Throughout this Lesson, help boys to identify positive peer influences and how they themselves can be sources of positive support for their friends and other people they care about.

## Preparation for Activities 1 and 2 - Friendship Boardgame

Activities 1 and 2 - Friendship Boardgame will require you to print a boardgame contained at the end of this lesson ahead of time. If you have a large group of learners, print several copies of the boardgame and ensure you have enough game pieces. Ideally, no more than 4 to 6 players would share a board. To make the boardgame sturdier, you can glue the boardgame to large pieces of cardboard or another tough material.

## Setting Up the Space (Do this for all Lessons!)

- If space allows, have the learners set up chairs in a circle facing in, or have them help you to lay a mat on the floor where everyone can sit in a circle on the floor. Ensure you also have a set at their same level. This helps in setting the tone that this is an equal and non-hierarchical space where everyone's opinion matters.
- Encourage boys, girls, and non-binary students to sit next to someone they do not know very well.

## Lesson 9: Friendships and Changing Relationships

## Objective

Help boys and their peers analyze how friends can positively or negatively influence their educational success in a fun, interactive way.

## Total Lesson Plan Time: 1 hour

Activity 1: Playing Together - Class Quest Boardgame (20 minutes)

Activity 2: Playing in Groups - Class Quest Boardgame (20 minutes)

Activity 3: Sharing Circle (20 minutes)

## Materials

- Printed copies of the 'Class Quest' boardgame and accompanying boardgame pieces:
- -Printed Class Quest Board Game
- -Dice or spinner
- -Player pieces (one per participant or small group).
- -Playing Cards (3 types printed)
- A ball or object that you can throw

## Activity 1: Playing Together - Class Quest Boardgame (20 minutes)

1. Explain that this activity will focus on how friends can positively or negatively influence how well we do in school.
2. Introduce the Class Quest Board Game. Have all the learners circle around the board so they can see how to play.
3. Explain the rules as noted in the box, 'How to Play.'

Setup:

• Each player chooses a piece and starts at the beginning.

• Shuffle the 3 card decks separately and place them in 3 piles in the center.

How to Play:

- Players take turns rolling the die and moving their piece.

• Land on a square → follow the color rule:

• Light Blue (Choice Cards): Draw a card.

- Green = move forward, Red = move back. · Yellow (Quiz Me): Draw a card, answer the question aloud.
- Dark Blue (Ask a Friend): Draw a card, ask another player the

question.

- After your action, the next player rolls.

Winning:

- First player to reach the end wins.
- If you roll past the end, wait until your next turn to move.
4. Ask for a few volunteers to play while the rest of the class observes. Play until the first player reaches Graduation.
5. Say: As we can see, friends have a big impact on our journey to graduation. They can help or negatively influence us. It is good to have people around who support and care about us. This will help you to succeed in school!

## Activity 2: Playing in Groups - Class Quest Boardgame (20 minutes)

Tip : In this activity, the learners will play the Class Quest Boardgame in small groups. To save time, set up 3 or more Class Quest boardgames throughout your space before you start the lesson.

6. Ask for a few volunteers to share what they remember about the rules of the Class Quest Boardgame.
7. Split the learners into small groups and assign each one a boardgame to play.
8. After 15 minutes, bring everyone back together and ask: How did your friends' actions help or hurt your journey to graduation?
9. End the activity by saying: Like we learned last time, the people around us have a big impact on your journey to graduation. School can be hard! It is important for us to surround ourselves with friends who help us succeed.

## Activity 3: Sharing Circle (20 minutes)

10. Ask for volunteers to share what they remember about the Class Quest Boardgame.
- How did your friends help you get to graduation?
- How did your friends prevent you from reaching graduation?
11. Say that you will now do game. Ask all the learners to stand in a circle.
12. Show them the ball. Say that after you ask a question you will throw the ball to a learner in the circle and they must answer the question (they can also choose to pass). After the question is answered, they can throw the ball to someone else in the circle to answer the same question. After several participants have answered the question, ask the next question.
13. Ask the following questions:
- Did any of the Class Quest Card stories feel real to you? Why or why not? (Note: Read a couple scenarios out loud to remind them)
- Succeeding in school takes work! What are some kind and helpful things boys can do to support their friends with schoolwork? What can you do for your friends?
14. Have everyone sit down in a circle after you have discussed the questions.
15. End with the Key Message: Boys and girls face different challenges to succeeding in school, and in many places it is more difficult for boys than girls to graduate from school. Part of the reason is because of the negative influence of peers. This is why it is so important for boys to have friends who care about them and want them to succeed in school and in life.

## Lesson Plan 10: My Academic Support System Teaching Tip Sheet

In this last Lesson, learners will celebrate how far they've come throughout the year in understanding how transforming gender norms will help them to succeed academically, how they've acquired new skills about how to do well in school, and gained stronger friendships.

As the group is coming to an end, plan ahead of time ways to keep them connected even though the Lessons are coming to an end. Are there other school- or community-based activities that could further support their education?  If there is time, it would also be good to invite parents, teachers, and local education authorities to one of these last activities so that they can witness the positive changes and feel motivated to continue supporting their education. Consult the Parents' Guide [Link] which provides a structure for how you can share the impact of these lessons with parents, caregivers, and school authorities.

You may also want to prepare an extra special surprise for these last activities like having certificates, sweet treats, or other forms of recognition that the learners would value.

## Setting Up the Space (Do this for all Lessons!)

- If space allows, have the learners set up chairs in a circle facing in, or have them help you to lay a mat on the floor where everyone can sit in a circle on the floor. Ensure you also have a set at their same level. This helps set the tone that this is an equal and non-hierarchical space where everyone's opinion matters.
- Encourage boys, girls, and non-binary students to sit next to someone they do not know very well.

1. Tell the learners that these next activities will help them to reflect back on all that they have all learned as a group. Say that it is important to reflect on what they have learned, and how they have grown.
2. Divide the learners into groups of 4 to 5.
3. Ask them to share in their group 1 thing they learned that will help them succeed in school, and 1 thing they will share with a friend. They will have about 10 minutes to discuss.
4. Walk around to each group and listen.
5. When groups are done, ask for 2-3 groups to volunteer to share what they learned and what they will share with a friend.
6. Thank them by saying they have learned so much throughout the school year. They are very smart and should feel proud of all that they have accomplished together.
