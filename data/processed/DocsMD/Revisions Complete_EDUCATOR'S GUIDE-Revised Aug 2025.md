## Acknowledgements

An Educator's Guide for Educating Boys and other Lifting Barriers global resources were developed with support from the Global Partnership for Education's Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE-KIX), a joint endeavour with the International Development Research Centre, Canada. This project is led by UNESCO in collaboration with Equimundo and the University of East Anglia and works to promote inclusive, positive masculinities and create education systems that are safer, more equitable, and more responsive to all learners' needs.  The resources developed under the Lifting Barriers project are for educators both inside and outside of the formal education system.

Jane Kato-Wallace and Cody Ragonese from Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice developed the ' Lifting Barriers ' resources with support from UNESCO and University of East Anglia. We wish to thank Matthias Eck, Tamara Marti Casado, and Vutha Lay from UNESCO, and Catherine Jere, Sushan Acharya from the University of East Anglia for their review.

## Glossary on Terminology

Boys' disengagement from education is understood as a gendered phenomenon partly rooted in societal norms and concepts of masculinity, which can lead boys and young men to consciously or unconsciously to withdraw from education. Additional social, economic and cultural factors, in families, communities and schools, may also lead to boys' low engagement with education and contribute to school leaving/dropout. Disengagement from education can manifest in different forms such as lack of interest, poor participation, absenteeism, neglecting homework or exam preparation and ultimately, dropping out (UNESCO, 2022a).

Curriculum (Plural: Curricula) is an inventory of activities related to the design, organization and planning of an education or training action, including definition of learning objectives, content, methods (including assessment) and material. In simple terms, a description of what, why, how and when students should learn (UNESCO-IIEP, n.d.; UNESCO-IBE, 2013).

Disadvantage in education refers to the intersecting social, economic, cultural, or structural conditions that limit educational access, participation, and outcomes. Disadvantage can lead to particular groups (e.g. boys or girls) having lower enrolment, retention and completion rates, and poorer educational outcomes, including subject mastery and attainment.

Discrimination is an unfair treatment or arbitrary distinction based on a person's race, sex, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, age, language, social origin or other status (UNESCO, 2022b).

Drop-out or school leaving refers to leaving school before the completion of a given stage of education or leaving at some intermediate or non-terminal point in a cycle of schooling. It can be temporary or definitive and can be the result of an active decision made by the learner or the result of push and/or pull factors (based on UNESCO-IIEP, n.d.)

Educational space is a space where teaching and learning takes place. It can be inside or outside the school, physical or virtual. This can include classrooms, libraries, community spaces (e.g. youth centers), as well as e-learning platforms.

Gender refers to the culturally defined roles, attributes, behaviours, identities and expectations associated with being male or female in a given context. It shapes how individuals act and interact, and the distribution of power and resources in relationships and society. Gender can be expressed through male, female, and non-binary identities and may or may not be congruent with the sex assigned to an individual at their time of birth . (based on UNESCO, 2022b).

Gender-based violence refers to violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering, against someone based on gender discrimination, gender role expectations and/or gender stereotypes, or based on the differential power status linked to gender (UNESCO, 2022b).

Gender equality in education means that the right to education of all learners is respected equally regardless of gender. Learners of all genders are given equal access to learning opportunities, resources and protections, and learners of all genders benefit from and are treated in education equally (based on UNESCO, 2019a). Gender equality through education refers to education's key role in addressing the wider issue of gender equality. Educational institutions can promote equitable attitudes, changing the way people think about traditional gender roles and helping to build long-term sustainable change. And achieving equal outcomes for female, male and non-binary learners can help to empower all people to create better lives (UNESCO, 2019a). Gender norms are understood as ideas about how men and women should behave: the expectations and standards that are set for each gender in different societies, cultures and communities. They are both context- and time-specific. People internalize these 'rules' at an early age, in the beginning of a cycle of gender socialization and stereotyping that continues for the rest of their lives. Gender norms thus not only become individuals' expectations of others, but also of themselves. Gender norms can be harmful, such as those that limit individuals' behaviours, opportunities, aspirations or relationships based on their gender, or that reinforce unequal power relations between genders (see also 'harmful and restrictive masculinities'). They can also be positive, when they promote equity, inclusion and shared power, for example, by encouraging people of all genders to pursue a full range of roles, express themselves freely, and share responsibilities (see also 'positive and inclusive masculinities'). The socialization process happening within educational institutions often replicates that of broader society and can contribute to the reproduction of social and gender norms (Marcus et al. 2024; UNICEF et al., 2019; Cookson et al., 2023; Stromquist, 2007). Gender parity in education is an indicator of the ratio of girls to boys, women to men. Gender parity is reached when there is equal representation and participation of male and female learners in education. It is a useful indicator, but by itself does not measure gender equality (UNESCO, 2022b). Gender-responsive means that strategies include evidence-based gender analysis which identifies and acknowledges existing gender differences, needs and inequalities. Activities at this level include specific policies and actions that address inequalities. Gender-responsive strategies, such as training in gender-responsive pedagogy, can be used as part of a system-wide, gender-transformative approach to education. Gender-responsive pedagogy is understood as teaching and learning processes that pay attention to the specific learning needs of learners of different genders. In practical terms, this means that the learning materials, methodologies, content, learning activities, language use, classroom interaction, assessment and classroom set up respond to specific needs of learners of different genders (UNESCO-IIEP, n.d.).

Gender socialisation is the process through which individuals learn, internalize, and perform socially constructed gender norms, roles, and behaviours. This occurs through interactions with key agents of socialization, such as family, peers, the media, and social institutions. For example, boys learn and internalize how 'real men' should be through gender socialization (John et al., 2017).

Gender stereotypes are simplistic generalizations about the gender attributes, differences and roles of girls, women, boys and men and people of other genders (UN Women, 2025). A gender-transformative approach entails addressing the underlying causes of gender inequalities. It includes implementing policies and initiatives which not only address the different needs, aspirations, capacities and contributions of girls, boys, women, men and non-binary people, but also challenge existing and discriminatory policies and practices, creating radical change. A gender-transformative approach to education is one that encompasses policy, programming and interventions to create opportunities to actively challenge gender norms and wider inequalities. This includes promoting gender equality through curricular and teaching reforms (UNESCO, 2022a). Harmful and restrictive masculinities are linked to hegemonic gender norms which suggest that boys and men should conform to a 'right' or 'ideal' way to be a man or a boy (see 'hegemonic masculinity'). This 'ideal' places pressure on boys and men to conform to certain expectations, which often include being self-sufficient, acting tough and using aggression to solve conflict. It is constructed in opposition to femininities and/or marginalized masculinities. Such ideas and practices of masculinity are harmful to girls, women and non-binary people as they uphold men's privilege over women and non-binary people. They are also harmful to boys and men, who are regulated by rigid expectations of manhood that restrict their freedom to express emotions, seek help, or deviate from dominant masculine norms. Harmful and restrictive masculinities can undermine boys' motivation and learning, because they often position academic effort and aspiration as incompatible with being a 'real' boy or man, affecting boys' motivation to learn (Heilman et al., 2017; UNESCO, 2022a; UNESCO-IBE, 2025 WHO, 2019). Hegemonic masculinity is the culturally dominant form of masculinity that is commonly upheld as the 'right' or 'ideal' way to be a man or a boy. In many contexts it positions men and boys as superior to women and girls and people of other gender identities, with negative consequences for people of all genders (Connell, 2005; Marcus et al., 2024). Homophobia refers to fear, discomfort, intolerance or hatred of homosexuality or sexually diverse people (UNESCO, 2015). Inclusive education is the process of strengthening the capacity of the education system to reach out to and include all students (UNESCO, 2022b). Intersectionality refers to the way in which different aspects of a person's identity, such as gender, age, disability, ethnicity, geography, socioeconomic status, displacement and sexual orientation and gender identity and expression interact to shape their experiences and access to power, opportunities, and rights. It recognizes that people can face multiple, overlapping and compounding forms of discrimination and marginalization. Notions of masculinity interact with the above characteristics in complex and reinforcing ways (Crenshaw, 2017; Marcus et al., 2024; UNESCO, 2020; UN Women and UNPRPD, 2022). use additional terminologies. Lesbian refers to a woman who is emotionally, romantically, or

LGBTIQ+ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer/questioning people, with the '+' symbol acknowledging those who identify as gender-diverse and who sexually attracted to other women. Gay refers to a person, often understood to be a man, who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to people of the same gender.

Bisexual refers to a person who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to more than one gender. Transgender refers to a person whose gender identity and/or expression differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Intersex refers to a person born with physical sex characteristics (such as chromosomes, sexual anatomy, or reproductive organs) that do not fit typical definitions of male or female. Queer is often used as an umbrella term for sexual and gender diversity. Questioning refers to a person who is exploring or uncertain about their sexual orientation or gender identity (based on UNESCO, 2020; UNESCO, 2019b; UNESCO, 2016).

Non-binary is an umbrella term that refers to a gender identity outside of the male-female gender binary. This can include people with a specific gender identity other than man or woman, people who identify as two or more genders, and people who do not identify with any gender (based on UNHCR, 2024). Positive and healthy masculinities emphasize the constructive aspects of masculine identities. They serve as a counterpoint to harmful and restrictive gender norms that portray men and boys as potential perpetrators or aggressors and focus solely on the harm they cause to themselves and others. It emphasises that all boys and men should be free to express diverse expressions of positive masculinities without fear of exclusion, ridicule or violence. Positive and healthy masculinities refer to alternative expressions of 'hegemonic masculinity' (see above) that align with egalitarian values and promote health and well-being. Examples include committed fatherhood and partnership, caring and intimacy, and help-seeking behaviour. The use of the plural term 'masculinities' underscores that there are many positive ways to be a boy or man. It also recognizes that masculine (and feminine) gender norms differ across cultures and contexts and change over time. Promoting positive and healthy masculinities is central in efforts to shift gender norms that harm boys and men and the people around them (based on UNESCO, 2014; UN Women, 2016). Sex: Refers to the biological characteristics that distinguish males, females and intersex individuals (UNESCO, 2022b). Sex characteristics are physical or biological features. Sexual orientation refers to a person's capacity for profound emotional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender, the same gender or more than one gender (UNESCO, 2019b; UNESCO, 2016). Social norms refer to rules, often informal and implicit, that guide how people are expected to behave in a group or society. People are often rewarded for conforming to these norms and punished for deviating from them (Marcus et al., 2024). training, pedagogies, environments and engaging with parents and caregivers (Marcus et al.,

A whole-school approach considers the entire school ecosystem rather than its individual parts when working with students and teachers to achieve change, for example towards gender equality. Common elements of a whole-school approach are policies, teacher 2024; Plan International et al., 2021).

## Complementing Gender Equality Efforts in Education

The Lifting Barriers Global Resources on supporting boys' engagement in education is designed to complement, not compete with, existing efforts to promote girls' education and gender equality in schools. Significant progress has been made in addressing barriers to girls' education and this important work must continue. At the same time, many boys face challenges that impact their learning, well-being, and future opportunities. This guide aims to be a complement to broader gender equality efforts, including those focused on girls' education. Teachers, parents, and school leaders can use the Lifting Barriers materials alongside existing strategies to ensure all learners have the support they need to succeed.

Strengthening boys' engagement in education is not just about improving outcomes for boys; it also contributes to gender equality more broadly. When schools challenge harmful and restrictive masculine norms and foster more inclusive spaces, girls as well as boys benefit from more equitable learning environments, free from harmful stereotypes and imbalances. Ensuring all children, regardless of gender, can fully participate in their education is essential for building a more just and equal society.

## Overview

An Educator's Guide to Educating Boys was developed to help educators create gender-transformative learning environments that nurture boys' learning, motivation, and engagement with education. UNESCO's 2022 Global report on boys' disengagement from education highlighted that gendered norms and expectations in families, communities and schools impact on boys' opportunities, motivation and desire to learn. School activities and certain subjects may also be considered at odds with expressions of masculinity, making education unpopular with boys. Boys' disengagement limits not only their future opportunities, but also prospects for more gender-equal societies.

This guide aims to provide educators with information and recommendations on how to create gender-transformative learning environments that:

- Value boys and help them to become who they want to be and to achieve their academic potential.
- Challenge the limiting gender norms that drive boys' disengagement, and expand expectations to support their wellbeing and success in education..
- Create more inclusive learning environments that address all learners' needs.

Five Main Resources to Address Boys' Disengagement from Education

<!-- image -->

The Educator's Guide is part of a set of resources developed under the Lifting barriers: Educating boys for gender equality project, supported by the Global Partnership for Education's Knowledge and Innovation Exchange (GPE-KIX), a joint endeavour with the International Development Research Centre, Canada. This project is led by UNESCO in collaboration with Equimundo and the University of East Anglia and works to promote inclusive, positive masculinities and create education systems that are safer, more equitable, and more responsive to all learners' needs.  The resources developed under the Lifting Barriers project are for educators both inside and outside of the formal education system.

## Other Lifting Barriers Resources include:

- In-Classroom Modules for Educators: Lesson plans and activities that help educators such as teachers introduce gender equality topics in the classroom with a particular focus on boys, and increase awareness of how societal gender inequalities shape boys' and their peers' lives, opportunities, and choices.
- Boys Club Implementation Guide: A resource to support facilitators in creating and sustaining Boys' Clubs-safe, engaging spaces where boys can explore healthy and positive masculinity, build social-emotional skills, and contribute to gender equality and their own educational success.
- Guide to Working with Parents and Caregivers to Support Boys' Education : A guide for schools and key stakeholders to engage parents and caregivers in discussions about the value of boys' education and how gender equality positively impacts their well-being.
- Guidance for Teaching and Learning Materials: This guide has been developed to support Ministries of Education and other stakeholders involved in the revision or development of teaching and learning materials with the aim of ensuring that these materials actively promote gender equality and inclusion.

## Purpose of the Educator's Guide and Main Objectives

The Educator's Guide, along with all other Lifting Barriers resources, takes a gender-transformative and asset-based approach to engaging boys. A gender-transformative approach to education involves working with learners to challenge and change the root causes of gender inequality-such as the harmful gender attitudes and behaviours that contribute to boys' disengagement from the classroom-while encouraging them to reimagine and embrace more gender-equitable alternatives. An asset-based approach shifts the focus from treating boys as problems to be fixed to recognizing their strengths and capacity to reach their academic potential.

The overall purpose of this Educator's Guide is to provide educators with information and recommendations on how to work with boys to challenge the limiting gender norms driving boys' disengagement, expanding their sense of self and cultivate critical thinking. By doing so, they will be better able to question and resist these limiting gender norms and, in the process, create more inclusive, gender-transformative learning environments for all.

## Main Objectives

By using this Educator's Guide, educators like you will:

- Understand some of the factors that contribute to boys' disengagement from education and learning at the school level;
- Understand how personal attitudes and biases shape the way educators interact with their learners;
- Know about effective gender-transformative and inclusive teaching practices that you can use in the classroom to strengthen educator-learner relationships, and foster greater well-being, supporting both boys and girls;
- Be able to implement curricula that encourages critical reflection on gender norms, roles, and stereotypes, and promotes empathy for diverse gender identities and experiences.

This guide is for educators (e.g. teachers, teacher trainers, teaching assistants) working with upper primary school learners (roughly, ages 9 to 12 years old). The ages of upper primary learners vary slightly across different countries, but generally, 'upper primary' refers to the last few years of primary education before transitioning to lower secondary school. This is because globally, research shows that boys are more likely than girls to face difficulties in the transition between upper primary to secondary school. 1

While the guide focuses on supporting boys' engagement in education, all learners should be enabled to challenge and help change rigid gender norms and learn from learning materials that are gender-transformative. This means educators can use this guide with all learners - boys, girls, and their non-binary peers - to promote a positive learning culture inclusive and free from discriminatory attitudes, behaviors, and stereotypes.

## How to Use This Guide

This guide aims to be educator-friendly, easy to use, and interactive. It is structured as follows:

- Part 1: Understanding Boys' Disengagement from Education This section provides context for understanding some of the driving factors behind boys' disengagement, including the impact of harmful gender norms on boys' attitudes and behaviours in the classroom.
- Part 2: Understanding Gender and Its Consequences on Boys' Education This section provides an overview of key gender concepts and describes how harmful and restrictive masculine norms can affect boys' engagement in education. By exploring foundational concepts, this section aims to illustrate how gender norms can shape the interactions between boys and educators within the classroom setting.
- Part 3: Unpacking Our Own Gender Attitudes and behaviours. This section explores how educators' own attitudes and norms can significantly influence their teaching by shaping their educator's expectations, interactions, and classroom practices, often leading to differential treatment of learners based on their gender.
- Part 4: Gender-Transformative Education in Practice. This section focuses on ways educators can teach in more gender-inclusive and transformative ways in terms of promoting a positive learning culture that stimulates the interests of all learners and challenges and actively works to change harmful gender norms in educational spaces.

Throughout the Educator's Guide there are practical exercises that can be done individually or with other colleagues in a teacher training-type setting to encourage reflection on personal gender norms and biases that may influence teaching practices, and take steps to address and challenge harmful gender norms in school.

This guide does not include specific gender-focused lesson plans to do with learners in the classroom. For this, please see the Lifting Barriers Resource, Classroom Lesson Plans for Learners on Masculinities and Gender Equality [LINK], which includes 10 gender-transformative lesson plans tailored for educators working with upper primary school level learners. It is strongly recommended that educators first utilize the resources in the Educator's Guide before implementing the Classroom Lesson Plans, and other Lifting Barriers resources.

## Using the Guide in Teacher Training

This guide can be used as a complement to online and/or in-person teacher training on gender equality typically organized by your learning institution. These trainings are typically organized at a district or regional level and are sometimes run by civil society organizations such as NGOs. Teacher training on gender equality usually consists of providing teaching strategies to create a more inclusive learning environment for all learners, regardless of their gender such as effective instructional methods, critically reviewing existing curriculum content for gender stereotypes, and how to interact with learners in ways that promote greater gender equality.

This guide can be used to inform and further strengthen such teacher training by integrating a focus on the needs, vulnerabilities and challenges boys face in education.

Teacher trainers can use this guide by:

- Adapting the background information on the driving factors behind boys' disengagement to the local context by including relevant statistical data, and providing a space for sharing professional challenges of keeping boys' engaged in the classroom.
- Facilitating the interactive learning exercises included throughout this guide to reflect with colleagues on the specific challenges boys face to engaging in their education, and provoke discussion on the realistic changes educators and their institutions can make to create more enabling environments for learning.
- Modeling some of the teaching strategies outlined in the guide, as well as testing them with educators through observation in the classroom.

## The Importance of an Enabling Environment

Efforts to promote gender equality in the classroom must be approached thoughtfully in conjunction with wider school mandates and initiatives, and communicated transparently with parents and caregivers. This guide will be most effective when there is already an enabling environment for educators such as:

- National and local education policies mandating gender equality education in schools and that require the use of gender responsive and/or inclusive pedagogy;
- Education ministries and higher institutional allies who articulate the importance of gender equality in schools, provide sufficient resources, and develop and distribute materials to guide schools on how to integrate such topics in the classroom;
- Strong professional associations , such as teacher networks, who play a vital role in supporting educators through training on gender equality and in leading collaborative strategy development to address potential challenges they may encounter. These networks can empower educators to confidently navigate discussions around gender equality.
- Teacher colleges that provide pre- and in-service teacher training on gender-transformative pedagogy.
- School leadership that prioritizes gender equality by supporting school-wide initiatives, and communicates with caregivers about why these initiatives will benefit all learners, regardless of gender, both inside and outside the classroom.

By having a supportive and enabling environment, educators will be both empowered to take action on the recommendations included in this guide, and be better equipped to address potential resistance to advancing gender equality in and through education.

## Part 1: Understanding Gender and Its Consequences on Boys' Education

This section looks at how gender norms influence both boys' and educators' interactions in the classroom.

'Understanding how masculinities and societal gender norms interact with boys' (and girls') participation, progression and learning outcomes at school is critical to ensuring gender equality in and beyond the classroom.' - UNESCO, Leave No Child Behind

## Gender Concepts

As educators, you interact with learners who bring diverse experiences, identities, and ways of engaging with learning. To effectively support all learners-especially boys who may be disengaging from their education-it is important to understand the difference between biological sex and gender , as well as how societal expectations shape learning behaviours.

## BIOLOGICAL SEX AND GENDER 2

2 Glossary: Understanding Concepts around Gender Equality and Inclusion in Education. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 7, place de Fontenoy, 75352 Paris 07 SP, France

The definitions below show the difference between sex and gender, but it is important to note that the two are also linked - gender is usually assigned and reinforced based on how someone's biological sex is perceived.

<!-- image -->

Biological sex refers to the biological characteristics (e.g., chromosomes, hormones, reproductive organs) that distinguish males and females. These characteristics are typically used to classify individuals as male or female at birth. However, biological sex is not always binary or fixed, and intersex people-whose bodies don't fit typical definitions of male or female-remind us of the diversity of human biology.

<!-- image -->

Gender refers to the roles, behaviours, and expectations that society assigns to people based on whether they are a man, boy, woman or girl. It shapes how individuals interact, their attitudes, and the power they have in society and in their relationships. Gender is not just about being a boy or a girl-it's also about how they relate to each other in society. Gender is also not innate or static; it is socially constructed, varies across cultures and time periods, and includes a spectrum of identities beyond just man and woman.

Traditionally, the unequal distribution of power based on gender results in patriarchy , where men and masculine traits are considered more important than women, or what is considered feminine. Globally, women and girls suffer worse consequences as a result of these inequalities based on gender. At the same time, gender norms (society's unwritten or rigidly written rules for how men and women should feel, think, how they should behave, etc.) also put pressure on boys and men to conform to harmful and restrictive masculine norms (society's definitions of what it means to be a man) such as avoiding seeking help, rejecting the healthy expression of emotions, or defining self-worth solely by their ability to accumulate wealth. This has a real impact on many boys' engagement in school.

## Harmful and Restrictive Masculine Norms and School Engagement

Ideas about masculinity vary across cultures and between social groups and evolve over time. These are not inherent or biological. For example, what it means to be a man can be shaped depending on your ethnic group, religion, or sexual orientation. At the same time, rigid definitions of masculinity have been shown to have a profound influence on the way boys approach learning around the world . 3 Here are some examples of how:

<!-- image -->

- Boys may feel pressure to be independent learners and avoid seeking help, leading to frustration and disengagement.

3 UNESCO Leave No Child Behind

- Some boys may resist activities associated with emotional expression (e.g., reading, writing, or discussing feelings) because of societal messages that view these qualities as 'feminine' and therefore incompatible with rigid definitions of masculinity.
- Certain subjects (e.g., literature, the arts) may be perceived as 'less masculine,' discouraging boys from engaging fully.
- Society often associates certain behaviours, interests, and learning styles with boys or girls (e.g., "boys are naturally better at math," "girls are more organized") and these assumptions influence how learners view what they are capable of (or not).

Gender norms such as these can affect classroom behaviour, participation, and attitudes toward learning.

Like girls, boys internalize these masculine norms from an early age through gender socialization . Gender socialization is the process of learning how to behave in accordance with gender roles and expectations and begins at birth and continues through adolescence and beyond. Gender socialization happens through our interactions with family, peers, and social institutions like schools and the media.

Because gender is learned, this means there are also opportunities for educators to help boys reframe and reimagine harmful and restrictive masculine gender norms to create a more supportive and engaging learning environment, helping them thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. By fostering an environment where boys can be themselves without the limitations of harmful gender norms, schools can unlock their full potential-leading to happier, more engaged, and more successful learners.

## Intersections Between Gender and Other Identities

Different aspects of a learners' identity -such as their age, sexuality, or disability - further shape their life experiences. In practice, this means that learners do not all experience school in the same way. Some may feel welcomed, included, and supported, while others may face exclusion, bullying, or unequal treatment because of who they are.

For example, students with diverse sexual orientations or gender identities (sometimes referred to as SOGIE) face higher risks of being bullied. In Thailand, more than half of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender (LGBT) students surveyed said they had been bullied because of who they are. 4

Age also plays a role. Young children and teenagers experience different kinds of violence. As girls reach adolescence, they may face greater risks of gender-based violence (GBV)-for example, violence from boyfriends, unwanted sexual attention, or online harassment. 5

Disability and race also play a big role in learners' education in school. For example, in Bangladesh, children with disabilities who are enrolled in school are on average more than

two years behind their peers (same age) in academic progress. 6 In addition, girls with disabilities are two to four times more likely to experience sexual violence from male students than girls without disabilities. 7

Race, nationality, and migration status also affect how learners experience violence. In the Pacific and sub-Saharan Africa, around one in seven students said they were bullied because of their race, nationality, or skin color. 8

In summary, intersectionality reminds educators to look beyond single factors like gender and consider how multiple layers of identity interact to influence learning, participation, and safety. When educators are aware of these intersections, they can create more inclusive classrooms that recognize and respond to the different needs and strengths of all students.

## Part 1 Summary

- ❖ Gender norms, particularly harmful masculine norms, influence boys' educational experiences.
- ❖ Biological sex is defined as physical characteristics and gender as the roles, behaviors, and expectations society assigns. Gender is learned and how it is expressed varies across cultures.
- ❖ Because rigid gender norms can negatively impact boys' engagement in their education, educators have an opportunity to help boys reframe these norms, creating a more supportive learning environment where they can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.
- ❖ An intersectional lens helps educators to look beyond single factors like gender and consider how multiple layers of identity interact to influence learning, participation, and safety.

## Part 2: Understanding Boys' Disengagement from Education

This section looks at some of the driving factors behind boys' disengagement from education.

Education is a fundamental right for everyone. As part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4): Quality Education aims to ensure inclusive, equitable, and quality education for everyone and promote lifelong learning opportunities. It is a commitment for countries to take measures that ensure inclusive and quality education, as well as lifelong learning opportunities for all.

However, as evidenced by the 2022 UNESCO Global report on boys' disengagement from education, although girls are less likely to enter education in the first place, in many

6 UNICEF concerned that more than half of children with disabilities in Bangladesh do not go to school

countries boys are at greater risk than girls of repeating grades, having poor learning outcomes, and failing to complete their education. Since the early 2000s, boys' disengagement has been a concern in high- or upper-middle-income contexts, or in regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean. And new patterns are emerging. Gender gaps in some low and lower-middle income countries - where historically girls were less likely to be in school - are narrowing and several countries are facing a 'reversal' in gender gaps, with fewer boys progressing and completing their education. Across all countries, evidence of boys' disengagement is most prevalent at the secondary level.

## Factors Driving Boys' Disengagement

There are many overlapping factors to help explain why boys' disengagement is happening in low-, middle- and high-income countries around the world. Let's look at some examples using the image here.

## [Designer - can you make this more visually appealing using the image below]

1. Individual Level (e.g. expectations for themselves, hopes, personal beliefs, their personal identities) - Boys may feel discouraged or disillusioned about staying in school because there are few job opportunities for those with higher education; they may also harbor beliefs that asking for help with a school subject or even being seen as achieving academically is 'unmanly;' boys may also feel discouraged to persevere with their education due to previous poor academic performance. Many boys struggle in school due to undiagnosed learning differences or teaching methods that don't fit their needs, and because they're often socialized to hide emotions and avoid seeking help, which can lead to frustration, disengagement, or disruptive behavior. Boys belonging to a marginalized group based on their other identities such as race, ethnicity, religion, caste, or economic class,may face barriers due to stigma and discrimination.
2. Family Level (e.g. relationship with family, family expectations) - With their families, due to the social expectation that young men must earn money to support the family, vulnerable boys (e.g. belonging to low-income families, are from a migrant or refugee community) may feel pressure to drop out of school and find employment. Families may also be generally disengaged themselves from the school system as their sons grow up, or are preoccupied with younger children.
3. Peer Level (e.g. relationships, expectations from friends) - With their peers, boys may discourage each other from engaging in perceived 'feminine activities' such as reading or studying. With friends, boys may feel peer pressure to join gangs, and engage in drug and alcohol use further disincentivizing them from participating in school. Many boys experience bullying in both online and offline spaces as well as other forms of violence. There may also be a lack of in and out-of-school opportunities for learners that can influence their participation in education, progression, and learning outcomes.
4. School Level (e.g. learning environments, school policies, teacher-learner relationships) - In schools, boys may be disengaged due to teacher's discriminatory gender attitudes, top-down and authoritarian teaching styles by school staff who tend to problematize boys' behaviour. The use of harsh punishment fuels both a fear

- of learning and low levels of trust between learners and teachers. There may also be a lack of awareness on the part of educators on how to create more gender-transformative spaces for all. Boys may perceive that school curricula may not match their interests and future aspirations.
5. Wider Society (e.g. influence of laws, social media, labor market, gender norms), -At the societal level, boys are disengaged in places where there are high levels of poverty, and a lack, or poor, implementation of educational policies that encourage greater gender parity (relative equal numbers of boys and girls enrolled in school). In such places, we also see low levels of public support for gender equality, helping to further entrench rigid gender roles. Countries experiencing conflict and forced migration also push boys out of school or prevent them from completing their education. In addition, many boys are influenced by social media's hyper-masculine spaces that emphasize wealth and rebellion over academic success.

## Consequences of Boys' Disengagement

There are many long-term and lifelong costs to boys, men, and wider society when they are not engaged in education. These include 9 :

- Poorer economic outcomes , such as lower salaries since higher educational attainment often translates into acquiring skills that are better remunerated. 10
- Poorer health and well-being . Research shows men with higher educational attainment have better health outcomes, while a lack of education and employment opportunities can push men into poverty and to have poorer health outcomes. 11
- Worse gender attitudes and relationships . Better educated men are more likely to support policies that promote gender equality and protect women from

discrimination, while poorer gender attitudes are linked with men's perpetration of violence against intimate partners, and unequal caregiving roles in the household. 12

Boys' disengagement from education can also significantly impact both the morale and effectiveness of educators . Educators may observe noticeable differences in classroom engagement between boys and girls, along with increased disruptions, behavioural challenges, and conflict-often stemming from boys' frustration with academic performance. These issues not only create a more challenging teaching environment but can also contribute to teacher stress, burnout and decreased motivation to support learner success.

While educators cannot and should not be expected to address all the underlying causes of boys' disengagement, they and their institutions play a crucial role in fostering a positive learning environment. By implementing more gender-transformative methods and fostering an overall sense of belonging , educators can help reignite boys' interest in learning and promote a lifelong love of education.

## Working with Girls

Importantly, working with boys must go hand in hand with continued efforts to support girls' empowerment and education. This is not a zero-sum game-advancing gender equality requires a relational approach that addresses the experiences and needs of all children. Boys and girls are deeply interconnected in their families, schools, and communities, and the barriers they face are often reinforced by the same rigid gender norms. By engaging boys alongside girls in conversations about fairness, respect, and healthy relationships, we not only improve their well-being but also create an environment where all learners can thrive free from discrimination and violence. Gender equality is achieved not in isolation but through collective action, and investing in boys' engagement strengthens the foundation for a more just and inclusive future for all. For these reasons, educators should use the recommendations provided in this guide with all learners , regardless of gender, to promote a positive learning culture inclusive and free from stereotypes.

## Educator Exercise: Causes and Consequences of Boys' Disengagement in My Learning Institution

As with all Educator Exercises included in this guide, you can do this individually or as a group with other colleagues interested in addressing boys' disengagement from education.

## Objective:

To reflect on the factors contributing to boys' disengagement in education and the impact it has on the learning environment. This can be done individually or as a group.

12 Leave No Child Behind: Global Report on Boys' Disengagement from Education. (2022). United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Paris France (UNESCO).

## Time: About 2 hours

## Instructions:

## Part 1 - The Causes of Boys' Disengagement (1 hour)

1. Read and reflect on the following scenario.

In a Grade 7 classroom, several boys sit slouched at their desks, not taking notes and whispering to each other while the teacher gives instructions. When one boy struggles to read aloud, a few classmates laugh, and the teacher quickly moves on without addressing it. Later, when a girl raises her hand to answer a question, the teacher praises her for being 'well-behaved,' while telling the boys to 'man up and focus.' The boys roll their eyes and disengage further, some tapping pencils loudly or looking out the window.

Personally reflect - or if working in a group, discuss the next question together.

2. Identify the causes of boys' disengagement:
- In this scenario, what are some of the reasons why boys are not engaged in the classroom? Think about:
3. ■ Individual boys' gender attitudes, aspirations, and behaviours
4. ■ Influence from the social environment such as family members and peers
5. ■ Educator attitudes and teaching methods in the classroom
6. ■ Overall school culture
3. Reflect on your own educational setting. What are the causes of boys' disengagement thinking about:
8. ■ Individual boys' gender attitudes, aspirations, and behaviors.
9. ■ Influence from the social environment such as family members and peers
10. ■ Belonging to a socially marginalized group (e.g. based on religion, ethnicity or caste).
11. ■ Educator attitudes and teaching methods in the classroom
12. ■ Overall school culture
4. Write down or discuss at least three key reasons that stand out to you. If doing this exercise in a group, share and look for common themes.

## Part 2 - The Consequences of Boys' Disengagement (1 hour)

5. Discuss the consequences for your classroom when boys are not engaged in their education. For example, school drop out, bullying and perpetration of GBV (as a result of cultures of violence in school), disruption in the classroom, increased stress and workload for educators.
- Think about: behavioural challenges, challenging classroom dynamics, learning outcomes, and teacher morale.

6. If discussing in a group, highlight the specific ways boys' disengagement affects your classroom. Make note of any patterns in the consequences for how it impacts the learning environment.
7. To end the activity, brainstorm what are the opportunities in your educational institution for creating more enabling environments for boys to learn and thrive alongside their peers?
8. Proceed to Part 3 of the Educator's Guide.

## Part 2 Summary

- ❖ There are many complex and overlapping factors driving boys' disengagement from education at the individual, relationship, community, and wider societal levels. Many of these have to do with harmful and restrictive masculine norms.
- ❖ There are many lifelong consequences for boys who are unable to complete their education.
- ❖ Boys' disengagement also impacts the morale and effectiveness of educators, and can lead to stress and burnout.
- ❖ Engaging boys in education can not only improve their well-being, but can also create an environment where girls can thrive free from discrimination and violence.

## Part 3: Unpacking Our Own Gender Attitudes and Behaviours

This section explores how our own attitudes and norms can significantly influence our teaching by shaping an educator's expectations, interactions, and classroom practices, often leading to differential treatment of learners based on their gender. Begin this section by doing the Educator Exercise below.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Educator Exercise: My Gender Values, Attitudes and Practices 13

Objective:

Reflect on your gender values, attitudes and practices.

Time:

90 minutes

## Directions:

Part 1 - My Childhood Experiences (30 minutes)

13 This exercise includes an adapted activity from Gender Responsive Pedagogy in Early Childhood Education: A toolkit for Teachers and School Leaders by VVOB and Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE). UNESCO and the African Union.

1. On your own, or with a group of colleagues, reflect on your early schooling experiences related to gender.
- a. What do you remember about your own experience in primary or secondary school related to gender? Were boys and girls treated differently by teachers? How did that feel at the time?
- b. Were there moments when you felt limited or empowered based on your gender?
- c. What impact did those experiences have on your learning and confidence to do well in school?

## Part 2 - My Wider Environment (45 minutes)

2. Think about how your wider environment serves to reinforce gender norms and stereotypes. Write down:
- a. Traditional songs, stories, proverbs or sayings that reinforce rigid gender norms. These may emphasize gender differences (praising or belittling men or women).
- b. Customary practices that reinforce male dominance or place women in submissive roles.
- c. Rigid expectations in your society for different gender roles which limit people's future potential (e.g. men should work while women should stay at home to take care of the children)
3. For each item you write down, describe how these messages could influence the way you treat the learners in your classroom, particularly boys, and how they treat one another.
4. Reflect on the consequences for boys when we treat them this way? What are the consequences for other learners in the classroom?
5. Personally explore how you can shift your attitudes, beliefs, and practices in order to improve how you interact with your learners.

Key Take-Away : Like they are for boys, our gender attitudes and behaviours as educators are learned through our own personal experiences, our interactions with our culture, and the media, and these have a large influence on how we interact with learners in our classroom.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Some of our personal beliefs and attitudes about gender can be harmful to our learners if they lead to reinforcing stereotypes against boys and girls. When educators have low expectations for boys' educational achievement , they can unintentionally drive poor behaviour in the classroom, as well as drop out. When educators accept harmful norms such as tolerating aggression or punishing boys' for expressing emotions seen as feminine (e.g. crying, showing fear), they may unintentionally perpetuate cultures of violence in school. When educators dismiss disruptive behaviours 'because they are boys' or discipline boys more harshly than girls such as through the use of corporal punishment or expelling

them from school, this also harms boys' ability to succeed in school, and even encourages school dropout. 14

By recognizing and addressing biases in our own gendered expectations and interactions with learners, we can encourage boys to engage more fully in school, and build their confidence to learn alongside their peers. Let's look at this using the chart below:

| Common Practices that Reinforce Gender Inequality                                                                                       | Why Is This a Problem?                                                                                                                                            | Gender-Transformative and Other Alternative Ways of Teaching                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Gently patting a girl on the back who hurts herself and is crying, while a boy in the same situation is told, 'Get up, boys don't cry.' | Practices like these discourage boys from expressing their emotions and seeking help from caring adults.                                                          | Reflect on your own gendered attitudes and behaviours and the ways they may reinforce harmful gender norms. Acknowledge boys' emotions by saying, 'I see you are hurt. It is okay to be upset.'                                             |
| Seating noisy, disruptive boys next to 'well-behaved' girls hoping that this will 'calm' the boys and the class.                        | Such practices hold girls unfairly accountable for boys' behaviour, and also does not address the root causes of boys' disruptive behaviour.                      | Arrange seating based on learning needs rather than gender, such as pairing learners who can positively support each other's focus and engagement.                                                                                          |
| Punishing boys more harshly than girls believing them to be tougher and more undisciplined.                                             | Boys are more likely than girls to experience corporal punishment and harsh treatment from teachers. This has been linked to learners' early exit from schooling. | Boys flourish when they feel safe and respected. Employ the use of positive discipline techniques to prevent such behaviour such as setting clear expectations and rewarding positive behaviour. See more on corporal punishment on Page X. |
| Encouraging boys to play competitive sports while guiding girls toward cooperative activities.                                          | These discourage boys and girls from pursuing diverse interests that they would potentially enjoy, and reinforces stereotypical behaviour.                        | Encourage boys to try a variety of activities and let all learners choose based on interest, not stereotypes.                                                                                                                               |

All people, regardless of their gender, have the right to education and should be given equal opportunity to actively participate and make choices about in their learning. However, harmful and restrictive masculine norms both inside and outside the classroom are barriers to boys' engagement in education. Therefore, educators like you play an incredibly important role in creating spaces where all learners can be nurtured to think critically about gender equality and collaborate to foster peaceful learning environments and societies. We will look more in-depth at different ways educators can put gender-transformative education into practice later on in this guide.

## Reframing Our Perceptions of Boys

Educational institutions may see boys as 'problems to be fixed,' in the pursuit of more effectively engaging them in their education. For example, believing 'boys naturally resolve conflicts with force, so they need training' or 'Boys don't have the capacity to feel or express their emotions like girls, so we need to teach them how.' However, addressing boys' disengagement from education is more effective when framed using an asset-based approach , which shifts the focus from treating boys as problems to be fixed to recognizing their existing strengths and capacity to reach their academic potential.

It is important to reflect on your own beliefs and stereotypes about boys to understand where they come from and how they can be challenged and reframed.

Below is a set of principles that educators can use to guide their interactions with boys in educational spaces.

- Principle 1: All boys are equally deserving of support, care, understanding, and empathy in the classroom and beyond.
- Principle 2: Educating boys equally alongside others brings lifelong benefits for themselves, girls, and greater society.
- Principle 3: All boys can agents of change for gender equality, alongside their peers and create supportive environments for learning.

What are the other types of principles- or positive messages - you would like boys to hear in your educational institution?

My Principles for Working with Boys:

Do the next exercise to reflect on how gender norms shape boys' experiences in your educational context.

## Educator Exercise Activity: Reflections on Gender Norms and Manhood In My Context

## Objective:

To help educators reflect on how gender norms shape boys' experiences and engagement in the classroom, and to identify strategies to support their learning and well-being.

Time:

1 hour

## Directions:

1. On your own, or with a group of colleagues, reflect on the following questions:
- What does it mean to be a 'real man' in my context? What are both the positive and harmful qualities of manhood that my society values?
- How are these beliefs about manhood influenced by our culture, religion, gender identities, and our other identities?
- How do negative messages influence boys' learning and participation in school? How do positive messages influence boys' motivation to learn?
2. If you are doing this activity with others, divide yourselves into small groups. This can also be an individual exercise.
3. Each group should imagine and describe a typical day of a boy in upper primary school. Consider:
- What are their interactions like with their friends and peers? What about with girls?
- What are their interactions like with their teachers and other school staff? Is there a difference in their interactions with male versus female staff?
- What expectations do they have when they go home?
- Are there certain activities they participate in or avoid?
- What feelings do they have throughout the day? (e.g. happiness, frustration, peer pressure)
4. After 30 minutes, each group should present their typical days of a boy and share any interesting insights, noticeable patterns, or trends.
5. Reflect on the following questions:
- How do gender norms shape boys' school experiences?
15. ■ For example:
1. Boys are told not to show weakness by asking for help → They do not want to ask for help if they are struggling in class.
2. Boys feel pressure to provide economically for the family → More likely to drop out to find paid employment.

- Are there other aspects of their identities that influence their experiences in school?
- What positive (pro education) messages are they already receiving?
- ■ For example:
1. Boys are told to be brave and courageous → Willing to stand up to bullying behaviour.
2. Sense of responsibility → Internally motivated to work alongside female peers to accomplish classroom tasks.
6. Brainstorm on your own or with colleagues:
- How can we as educators challenge gender stereotypes that harm boys' ability to learn and engage in their education?
- How can we leverage the positive messages boys already receive?
7. Key Take-Away: By understanding boys' experiences and the impact of gender expectations, educators can create learning environments where all learners feel supported, engaged, and free to be themselves in ways that do not harm others.

As you can see, it is important to understand how boys' and educators' gender attitudes and broader gender norms influence their engagement in the classroom because they are also opportunities to promote more positive alternatives. Rather than focusing solely on what boys are doing wrong or need to change, it's essential to frame messages in a way that uplifts their aspirations and strengths.

## Part 3 Summary

- ❖ Like they are for boys, our gender attitudes and behaviours as educators are learned through our own personal experiences, our interactions with our culture, and the media, and these have a large influence on how we interact with learners in our classroom.
- ❖ Some of our personal beliefs and attitudes about gender can be harmful to our learners if they lead to treating boys and girls unequally in ways that reinforce gender stereotypes and norms.
- ❖ By recognizing and addressing biases in our own gendered expectations and interactions with learners, we can encourage boys to engage more fully in school, and build their confidence to learn alongside their peers.
- ❖ Addressing boys' disengagement from education is more effective when framed using an asset-based approach , which shifts the focus from treating boys as problems to be fixed to recognizing their strengths and capacity to be more gender-equitable and reach their academic potential.

## Part 4: Gender-Transformative Education in Practice

This section focuses on ways educators can teach in more gender-transformative ways in terms of promoting a positive learning culture that stimulates the interests of all learners and challenges and changes harmful gender norms in educational spaces.

For ideas on specific activities to incorporate into a lesson plan, please see the resource, Classroom Lesson Plans for Learners on Masculinities and Gender Equality [LINK]. This resource includes 10 gender-transformative lesson plans tailored for teachers working with upper primary school-level learners.

Taking a gender-transformative approach to education means working with your learners to directly challenge and change the root causes of gender inequality, such as the harmful gender attitudes and behaviours that perpetuate boys' disengagement from the classroom, and encouraging them to discover and embrace more peaceful and equitable alternatives.

At a wider level, a gender-transformative approach to education also means making changes to policies and initiatives so that wider school environments do not perpetuate gender norms and wider inequalities, and instead address and challenge them through promoting positive change.

So, what does this mean in practice? The next sections in this guide will provide you with recommendations, exercises, and examples on how to do this.

## Gender-Inclusive Language and Ways of Teaching

Think back to when you were 11 or 12 years old. What were your relationships with your educators like? Are there some educators with whom you had a more positive relationship? What attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours did that educator have that impacted you? How did they influence your hopes and dreams for the future?

Educators know that having a good student-teacher relationship is essential for learning. It is also an important factor that encourages boys' engagement in education. Let's look at how the way we teach in the classroom and how we interact with our learners is influenced by gender norms and personal attitudes.

The language we use can influence learners' feelings of respect and safety in the classroom. Research shows that educators' use of language is often used to ridicule boys and reinforce harmful gender stereotypes. Some common phrases and actions educators use based on gender are:

- 'We need a strong man to open that.'
- 'Girls are good at reading, boys are good at maths'
- 'Make sure your mom signs this form' (instead of saying 'parent' or 'caregiver')
- Saying that a boy is 'acting like a girl.'

- Using words like 'beautiful' and 'sweet' only for girls, while 'strong', 'smart' and 'bad' mainly for boys.
- Your voice and body language is rougher or more aggressive when addressing boys.
- You have less patience for disruptive behaviour for boys and give them harsher punishments than girls.
- Make girls clean up the classroom and boys went out to do manual labor around the school grounds.
- Recommend boys for remedial classes because of their disruptive behaviour

Our language and actions have a big impact not only on boys, but all children, regardless of their gender, because it communicates our feelings and expectations for their behaviour. By using stereotypical language, educators can unintentionally reinforce harmful gender stereotypes that can influence boys' behaviours and limit the expectations for their own futures. All children learn best when they are able to make independent choices in play, in the way they learn, and when their educators see them as equal.

## Recognizing and Addressing Intersecting Biases in the Classroom

Gender is not the only factor influencing how learners experience education. Biases related to ethnicity, caste, disability, socioeconomic background, and other identities often intersect, shaping learners' access to learning opportunities, their treatment by educators and peers, and their overall sense of belonging in school.

As educators, it is important to reflect on how multiple layers of discrimination may affect learners engagement in the classroom. Some boys, for example, may experience both gendered expectations and discrimination based on their ethnic or caste background, leading to even greater marginalization. Similarly, children with disabilities may struggle against both ableist attitudes and gender norms that limit their perceived potential.

## Real-Life Classroom Scenarios and Solutions:

- In a classroom in France, a refugee boy from Syria struggles with language barriers and is often excluded by his peers. The teacher can create buddy systems pairing him with supportive classmates that validate his background while helping him build confidence in the new language.
- A teacher in Brazil notices that a boy with a physical disability is never chosen for group activities. The teacher can intervene by assigning diverse teams, promoting inclusive activities, and modeling inclusive language to ensure all learners feel valued.
- A teacher in India notices that Dalit boys hesitate to participate in class discussions. Cultural and historical biases may have led them to feel unheard or excluded. The teacher can counter this by setting clear norms for respectful participation, calling on all learners equitably, and highlighting contributions from diverse voices in lessons.
- During break time in Canada, a group of boys is laughing at another boy because he doesn't like football and prefers to spend time with girls. One of them calls him 'gay' in a mocking way, and others join in. A school counselor or supervisor can remind the

- other boys of school rules around respect and kindness, and offer them an alternative activity to break up the group dynamic.
- In a rural school in Kenya, a teacher observes that boys from pastoralist communities are frequently absent. Gender norms and economic responsibilities may pressure them to work rather than attend school. The teacher can alert school authorities to with families to emphasize the long-term benefits of education and explore flexible learning options.
- In an Indonesian school, a boy is ridiculed for excelling in reading while other boys excel in sports. The teacher can challenge the stereotype that literacy is 'feminine' by showcasing male role models who are writers, journalists, and poets, and by integrating storytelling and creative writing into the curriculum in engaging ways.

## Ways to Create More Gender-Equitable Learning Environments

Creating more gender-equitable learning environments has wonderful advantages for both educators and all learners, but can especially benefit the boys who need more encouragement to fully engage in their education. Recommendations include:

1. Encourage boys to adapt a 'growth mindset', the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort, practice, and learning from mistakes, where failing is acceptable and an important part of learning. In many places, boys are struggling to progress and achieve learning at similar rates as girls. By linking mistakes with growth, you can strengthen boys' confidence to succeed in school.

2. Avoid presenting boys as oppressors by also encouraging discussion on male vulnerability, girls' agency,  and solidarity with socially excluded groups . 1516
3. Where appropriate, adapt learning activities so that learners can share personal perspectives and experiences, increasing their empathy for one another. Boys' have the capacity to empathize with their classmates, but the messages they receive about 'alpha male'masculinity (a term often used to describe and idealise a man who is socially and sexually dominant in his relationships with women and other men 17 ) discourages empathetic behaviour.
4. Disrupt harmful gender norms that emerge in your discussions or in your observation of classroom behaviour. For example, if boys mock each other for showing an interest in reading, which is sometimes seen as a 'feminine' trait. Calmly question why reading is considered a 'feminine' trait. Reference male teachers and other men in the community who enjoy reading.
5. Review your lesson plans, learning materials, and school manuals to find within them opportunities where learners can talk to each other about the topic and work to solve problems together in small groups (see more in Activities to Encourage Boys' Engagement). Where appropriate, these can become teachable moments opportunities to engage students in critical reflection about how such content reflects and reinforces gender norms.
6. In as many of your interactions as possible, use kind words and show empathy to all your learners regardless of their gender. 18

## Motivational Interviewing Techniques

Boys thrive, flourish, and enjoy learning more when they perceive that their educator is actively listening to them with kindness and respect. Motivational interviewing techniques have been shown to encourage participants to talk more, especially when dealing with topics that are particularly sensitive. The key steps to motivational interviewing techniques are as follows:

1. Ask open-ended questions that encourage participants to share their views more openly, and do not limit the conversation to 'yes/no' answers.
2. Listen and reflect back by acknowledging the learners' viewpoints and feelings.
3. Give positive feedback by thanking the student for sharing their responses.
4. Share fact-based knowledge.

See the scenario in the table for an example for how to put this into practice.

15 A group that is prevented from fully participating in the social, economic, political, and cultural life of a society, often due to factors like discrimination, poverty, disability, ethnicity, or gender effectively pushing them to the margins of society and denying them access to the same rights and opportunities as the majority population.

## Handling Student Disclosure

When learners, particularly boys, feel safe to open up to educators, they may be more likely to bring up troubling issues they experience outside the classroom, such as violence in the home. In preparation for this, you can do the following:

## With school leadership you can,

- Review what your mandatory reporting obligations are to ensure student safety.
- Become knowledgeable about what referrals are available both inside and outside the school to provide learners with additional support. If no referrals for health or protection services are available, make suggestions to school management to put these in place.

## With learners directly you can,

- Actively listen to their concerns and show empathy by understanding where they are coming from.
- If serious, ask to see the student later in private to learn more. Once in private, reassure the student by letting them know that they did the right thing by speaking up, and that you are there to support and help them.
- Help them to identify their needs and provide them with resources and support.
- Depending on the protocols of your institution, you may need to explain to the student that you will need to share the information with appropriate authorities to ensure their safety, but that you will keep the details as confidential as possible.
- Check in periodically with the student and parents/caregivers afterwards to see how they're doing.

## Educator Exercise: Observing Gender Norms in the Classroom 19

Objective: To guide educators on how to observe their gendered interactions with their learners with the support of another colleague.

Note: In some school settings with limited staff or high student-to-teacher ratios, having a second trained colleague available for observation may not be feasible. In such cases, consider alternative approaches such as using self-reflection tools (e.g., structured observation checklists) or recording and reviewing lessons (where appropriate and with consent). These adaptations can help ensure educators still benefit from critical reflection even in resource-constrained environments.

Time:

Duration of one class session.

## Directions:

1. Ask a colleague who has received training on gender equality to observe you in the classroom by taking notes in a notebook. Have them note down things such as:
- The type of language you use when speaking to boys, girls, and other peers, as well as learners representing different cultures or social groups.
- If you tend to favor one gender - or specific social group - over another when doing leadership activities, when asking for volunteers, or when asking for answers from learners.
- How you organize and divide up learners for activities and discussions.
2. Take time to reflect with your colleague on what they observed and note any changes you could make in your communication and overall teaching style.

## Ending the Use of Corporal Punishment in Educational Settings

The use of corporal punishment in educational settings has a negative impact on boys' educational outcomes, as well as all children regardless of gender. Its use - as well as other types of harsh discipline - are often highly gendered in practice, and are used to enforce gender roles and expected behaviour in schools. 20 In some countries, boys are perceived as tough and undisciplined, and consequently more likely to experience physical punishment, while girls are more likely to experience psychological and verbal forms of punishment. 21 However, educational institutions have the ability to create inclusive and gendertransformative learning environments without the use of corporal punishment.

## For educators:

Set clear expectations for behaviour. Work with learners to co-create group agreements that establish gender equality, fairness, and respect.

21 School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all. Policy Paper 17. (2015). Paris, UNESCO.

Model conflict resolution without violence. Rather than using physical discipline or shaming boys, which is often done out of anger or frustration, maintain respectful communication ( 'I see you are upset. Let's take a break and talk about what is going on' ). Alongside this, you can practice with learners simple self-regulation techniques such as breath meditation to manage emotions or counting to 10 before reacting to a conflict situation.

Resolve conflicts between learners peacefully. Encourage boys, and all learners regardless of gender, to resolve conflicts by expressing their feelings through mediation. Work with them to find solutions (e.g. 'How can we work together to focus?').

Create incentives to encourage positive behaviour. Educators can create incentives for boys who do well in school (e.g. 'if you work hard, then you will get extra time to read your favorite book or do an activity of your choice' ). Recognize and praise boys when they are working well with others, or when you see that they are putting in a lot of effort.

Encourage active movement. Take breaks from sitting for long periods by having learners engage in a learning activity while standing, or lead them in a fun game involving lots of movement. If you do not have enough space in the classroom for this, you might like to think about using an outdoor space once in a while, to make a change of scene

For schools and other educational settings:

Establish norms. Prohibit corporal punishment by introducing, disseminating, and enforcing codes of conduct for teachers and learners.

Support skills-strengthening. Provide training on positive non-violent discipline for teachers, as well as effective monitoring and response mechanisms.

## Addressing Bullying in Schools

Like corporal punishment, boys are more likely to experience certain types of peer violence in schools such as physical bullying, being more likely to use violence and in being victims. 22 When bullying-whether in person or online-goes unaddressed, it creates an environment where learners, particularly boys, may disengage from learning due to fear, social pressure, or diminished self-esteem. Homophobic and transphobic bullying, in particular, can make learning environments feel unsafe for all learners, not just those directly targeted. By taking proactive steps, educational institutions can foster a culture of respect, belonging, and active engagement in education.

## Educators and Other School Staff 23

- Educational institutions should provide training for educators to equip them with the skills to deliver curriculum approaches that promote the knowledge, attitudes and skills that children and adolescents need to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying.
- Create supportive school environments that encourage protective factors from bullying such as self-esteem, optimism, aspirations, problem-solving capacity and the ability to seek mentoring adult relationships.
- Review the school curriculum and teaching methods to teach and reinforce the principles of non-violence, promote positive attitudes, behaviours and peer relationships and equip children and adolescents with the skills required for respectful communication in person and in cyber-space, negotiation and non-violent resolution of problems.

## With Learners

- Recognize the power of bystanders: Teach boys and their peers that standing up for peers is a sign of strength, and provide safe ways to intervene or seek help.
- Encourage Allyship: Promote student-led initiatives that foster inclusivity and challenge harmful behaviours.
- Promote gender equality: Promote girls and marginalised learners into leadership positions, equal sharing of chores between girls and boys, and community support for girls and boys children at risk of school dropout.
- Foster Peer Support: Promote peer mentoring programmes or classroom initiatives where learners support one another and build a sense of community.

## Responding to Homophobic and Transphobic Bullying

Homophobic and transphobic bullying can cause deep harm, not only to LGBTQ+ learners but to the broader school culture. We can address this by:

- Intervening Consistently and Confidently: Address slurs, harassment, and exclusionary behaviour immediately, turning incidents into learning moments.
- Promoting Inclusive Language: Use and reinforce respectful, gender-inclusive language in our classroom discussions.
- Providing Supportive Resources: Ensure learners have access to counseling, safe spaces, and representation in school materials that affirm diverse identities.

By addressing bullying proactively and positively, we ensure that all learners-boys included-feel confident and motivated to engage in their education.

## Teaching Methods and Activities to Encourage Boys' Engagement in Education

Boys, like their peers, need support from their educational institutions to complete their basic education and enroll into university. When educators implement strategies that cater to the diverse backgrounds, abilities, and learning styles of their learners, they are more likely to maximize each person's potential. They are also providing learners with the choices, confidence, and ability to shape their future.

All learners, regardless of gender, learn and retain information in different ways. Educational institutions should make an effort to create more dynamic environments for learning and make use of effective pedagogical strategies to encourage boys' engagement in education. The following teaching methods all aim to encourage boys and their peers to explore a diverse range of opinions and perspectives when challenging gender stereotypes, broader inequalities, and beyond!

## [Design Proposal: Have each recommendation headlined by a simple illustration or symbol]

1. Book Clubs Encourage boys to take a more active role in reading where all learners take turns leading a weekly discussion on a book that they are reading. They can choose a passage or quote that was meaningful to them, or that made them question a personal belief that they would like to discuss with others.
2. Peer Teaching Assign learners to small gender-mixed groups where they teach each other concepts related to the day's lesson. Alternatively, you can organize classroom gallery walks where learners go from station to station contributing their ideas to different topics. For example, they can explore the gender roles and norms that existed at certain moments in history. At the end, learners summarize the ideas to the entire group.
3. Activities that foster teamwork and cooperation Encourage learners to respectfully debate ideas in structured discussions based on the lesson of the day. Encourage girls to take the lead by being 'debate captain' and encourage boys to support them by coming up with arguments that defend their team's perspective. You can also divide learners into gender-mixed teams to engage in friendly quiz competitions that re-cap learning from the week or month. Those teams that demonstrate the most collaboration and kindness receive a small reward.
4. Personal Reflection - Boys and learners of all genders are more engaged in their education when they see the relevance of a lesson to their everyday lives. Give space

- for learners to reflect on what they've learned. They can write in a journal, or lead a group reflection having everyone sit in a circle facing each other.
5. Role Plays - Similar to #4, role-plays can also be useful in giving learners space to practice new skills or play out scenarios that they experience in their everyday lives. For example, if learning about arithmetics, have learners do a role-play about how this type of math can be used to enhance financial literacy skills.
6. Story Telling - For much of human history, knowledge was passed down orally rather than through written language. Ask learners to create stories that challenge gender stereotypes inspired by the day's lesson and discuss the main messages.
7. Invite a speaker - Invite a male university student to speak to the class about what he did to study and prepare for his entrance exams, what caring adults were in his life that supported him, his experiences in higher education, and how his earlier education experiences prepared him to go to university.

By making learning active, relevant, and cooperative, educators can boost boys' motivation, confidence, and engagement. These strategies also ensure all learnesr benefit from a dynamic, inclusive classroom.

## Classroom Arrangements for Greater Gender Inclusivity and Equality Spaces

Traditional classroom set-ups are such that the educator is standing at the front of the classroom facing rows of desks in a 'lecture' format. However, such a classroom set up can make it difficult for learners to engage equally in their lessons, as well as participate in debates and activities about gender equality. Disengaged learners of all genders benefit when classrooms are arranged to encourage greater movement and interaction. Neurodiverse learners such as those with autism also benefit from more comfortable and inclusive spaces.

## Checklist for a Gender-Inclusive and Engaging Space

Use the checklist below to help you observe how you can create more engaging and gender-equitable classroom - and other learning - spaces for learners.

Notes for Adjustments Needed

- [ ] Do boys and girls tend to sit in specific areas (e.g., boys in the back, girls in the front)?

- [ ] Do I encourage mixed-gender seating and collaboration?

- [ ] Are the learners in the back of my classroom less engaged ? How can I bring them into discussions?

- [ ] Do I rotate seating or offer flexible seating arrangements to encourage interaction and movement ?

## Reflection questions:

- What patterns do I notice in my classroom?

- What seating patterns or classroom set-ups may be affecting boys' engagement?

- What small changes can I make to encourage greater engagement?

## Ideas for Classroom Set-Ups [Would be great to have illustrations here for each bullet]

The seating arrangement in a classroom affects learners' learning and participation.

- Instead of fixed seating, let learners switch places periodically to keep engagement fresh. However, be sensitive to gender dynamics where certain seating arrangements may make some learners feel unsafe (e.g. girls who may feel at greater risk of being sexually harassed, neurodivergent learners who value the predictability of seating arrangements)
- If there is space, change the placement of chairs and desks at certain times of the day or weeks, or for specific activities. For example, you can place desks in a circle in the center of the room to encourage greater gender inclusiveness and interaction as all learners are at the same level. You can also push desks up against the wall to provide more free space for activities that require more movement.
- Make use of outdoor space by taking learners outside for hands-on or group reflection activities.
- Use the chalkboard and other wall writing spaces as additional places where learners can collaborate together in smaller, mixed gender groups.
- If you are leading a group discussion, change your position in the classroom by sitting at the same level with your learners whether it is in chairs or on the floor.

## If space and resources allow:

- Use mats for group learning activities or establish a 'focus zone' for quiet work.
- Re-purpose everyday items such as logs, crates, and benches for flexible and diverse seating arrangements. You can also ask family and community members to donate old cushions or mats.
- Create different 'stations' throughout the classroom where learners can work in small groups and solve problems. This encourages greater peer-to-peer interaction.

## Lesson Planning

Although the content of a lesson is determined by the curriculum or the syllabus, educators take the responsibility for how to tailor it to their learners. Work with your school leadership to determine what flexibility there is to adjust your lesson plans to promote greater boys' engagement. In some cases, you may want to have your weekly lesson plans reviewed (if not already required) so that your school management team is aware of and on board with the gender messaging and content. Reviewing and adjusting lesson plans would be even more effective if done as part of a task force that includes educators across subjects, grade levels, and administrative personnel in diverse positions of leadership. By better coordinating your efforts with colleagues (e.g. school board, leadership), you will be better able to address any potential concerns or questions from learners, caregivers or other colleagues.

Questions to answer as you review lesson plans:

- Is there exclusion or over-representation of one gender over others in the images or text in the assigned materials?
- Are there gender stereotypes present with regard to the personal attributes of certain genders (e.g. only men are presented as successful, the sole breadwinners, or aggressive while only women are shown as caregivers and passive figures)
- Are the famous figures you are learning about (e.g. poets, political leaders, authors) mostly male?
- If assigning or reading a fictional story, how are the roles and relationships between men and women in the story portrayed? Who are the lead characters? Who are the background or supporting characters?
- Do the stories reflect the complexity of what it means to be a man or boy in reality?
- Do the stories reflect real-life diversity of your context?

If possible, adapt the syllabus to incorporate more diverse and inclusive stories, examples, and discussions of being a man or boy. This provides opportunities where you can reflect together on the importance of more diverse gender representation, and provoke discussions on the benefits of greater gender equality on learners' lives. For example, choose a story or moment from history that challenges their pre-conceived notions of gender roles (e.g. men taking on important caring roles) and encourage discussion on what they think about this. These examples should be a complement to existing efforts to promote more gender equal representation of women and girls.

However, using materials that perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes can also enhance learners' critical thinking . If you decide to use or are unable to change the assigned materials, ask questions to analyze gender stereotypes and harmful norms within those materials such as:

- For fictional stories, 'how does the male character feel in this situation?' 'Do boys ever feel like this? If so, when?' Relate the pressures from the story to their everyday lives.
- Are there men who also do [stereotypically female profession]? Who?
- Can a girl also do [stereotypically male profession]? Why or why not?

- Why might it be harmful if boys cannot choose what roles or professions they want?
- Why might it be harmful if girls cannot choose what roles and professions they want?

## Additional Lifting Barriers Resources on Lesson Planning

To support gender-transformative education, the Lifting Barriers Project has also produced the Global Guide on Gender-Transformative Teaching and Learning Materials.

Image of Global Guide with a link

This guide was developed to support Ministries of Education and other stakeholders involved in the revision or development of teaching and learning materials with the aim of ensuring that these materials actively promote gender equality and inclusion. It supports practical action for those reviewing existing materials through a gender lens - to assess whether they reinforce harmful and restrictive gender norms, and to guide revisions where needed - and for those involved in creating new materials that are intentionally designed to be gender-transformative. The practical tools in the guide support the revision or development of a specific product - such as a textbook, storybook, workbook, or assessment - and can be applied to materials designed for a wide range of subjects, education levels, and learning environments.

The primary audience for this guide is curriculum reviewers and developers, materials writers, subject specialists and publishers who select, revise and/or develop teaching and learning materials for schools and other educational settings. These personnel may be based within national ministries of education, private publishing companies, curriculum development agencies or academic institutions involved in the design and approval of teaching and learning materials. In addition, educators (teachers, school leaders, lecturers, trainers, support staff) responsible for the delivery of education, and who have some agency in selecting and using teaching and learning materials for their students, will find this guide useful.

## How to Address Potential Resistance to Gender Equality Efforts

The Influence of Social Media on Boys and Education Social media and influencers can negatively impact boys' education by promoting unrealistic lifestyles and limiting gender stereotypes. Constant exposure to social media may cause boys to prioritize social validation, gaming, or online trends over schoolwork. Some influencers glorify anti-intellectual attitudes, reinforcing the idea that education is unnecessary for success. Without guidance, boys may adopt limiting ideas about what it means to be a man such as discouraging emotional expression, perseverance, or academic ambition.

For guidance on how to talk to boys about the influence of social media see the Classroom Resource and the resource, Addressing the impact of Masculinity Influencers on teenage boys - A guide for schools, teachers and parents/guardians by O'Rourke, F., Baker, C. and McCashin, D. at the Anti-Bullying Centre, Dublin City University.

Educators deserve to feel safe and supported in their teaching spaces. Here are some tips to address potential challenges to promoting gender equality and boys' engagement in the classroom:

## Preventing and Preparing for Conflict Before It Starts

- In teacher training, work with school leadership on how to address topics related to boys' education, gender equality, and challenging power inequalities sensitively. Develop and exchange concrete strategies for how to address verbal challenges from learners who may not agree with the curriculum content.
- For example in teacher training, brainstorm all the potential negative reactions a teacher may hear from learners on small pieces of paper and toss into a hat or small bag. Have someone from the group pull out each negative reaction one-by-one and work together as a group to develop different types of responses . Note: Teacher responses should always aim to maintain a safe,inclusive, comfortable and cooperative learning atmosphere. Responses should never escalate conflict. See more below.
- Work with school leadership, such as school boards, to invite parents to a meeting to introduce the initiative and invite their feedback and input. Provide information on who they can contact if they have questions or concerns. For more information on how to work with parents, see the Parents Guide [Link to Parents Guide].
- Having sensitive discussions about gender needs to take place when learners feel safe in their learning environment. Use the strategies described in the previous sections to adjust teaching approaches to encourage greater feelings of safety and inclusion.

## Addressing Conflict in the Classroom

- Hear them. Do not attempt to immediately shut down sexist (e.g. disrespectful towards women and girls) comments because sometimes it can make things worse. Listen to the learners' reaction calmly and with understanding, but do not get drawn into an argument. Uphold class norms by modeling respect and setting of boundaries.
- Understand them. Acknowledge the fears or misconceptions the learner may have (e.g. 'I  hear you' or 'I understand where you are coming from'), but do not validate their harmful views.
- Encourage and challenge them (if safe). If you feel safe to do so, make it a learning opportunity by encouraging student debate. It is likely there will be other learners in the classroom who do not share the same views. For example, you can ask, 'What do we think about this opinion / comment? Does anyone have a different point of view?'
- Address them privately, if necessary. If the comment was particularly disrespectful, it was not safe to address in the classroom, or had the potential to harm others in the classroom, meet privately with the learner to better understand their concerns and address problematic behaviour.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! By going through this Teacher's Guide you now:

- Understand some of the factors that can contribute to boys' disengagement from education and learning at the school level;
- Understand how personal attitudes and biases shape the way educators interact with their learners;
- Know about effective gender-transformative and inclusive teaching practices that you can use in the classroom to strengthen educator-learner relationships, and foster greater well-being, supporting both boys and girls;
- Are better able to implement curricula that encourages critical reflection on gender norms, roles, and stereotypes, and promotes empathy for diverse gender identities and experiences.

Engaging boys in education is not about favoring one group over another-it is about ensuring that all learners have the opportunity to succeed in an inclusive, supportive learning environment. By reflecting on our own gender attitudes and behaviours, putting into practice active learning strategies and gender-inclusive teaching approaches, teachers can help boys stay engaged, motivated, and invested in their education.

However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Each classroom and learner is unique, and the key is to observe, reflect, and adjust based on what works best. Small changes-such as incorporating movement, encouraging emotional expression, and challenging gender stereotypes-can have a profound impact on boys' attitudes toward learning.

As educators, we have the power to shape learners' futures, and that begins with making

the classroom a place where every child-regardless of gender-feels valued, challenged, and capable of success. By continuously learning, adapting, and collaborating, we can ensure that boys remain engaged, motivated, and prepared for a future full of possibilities.
