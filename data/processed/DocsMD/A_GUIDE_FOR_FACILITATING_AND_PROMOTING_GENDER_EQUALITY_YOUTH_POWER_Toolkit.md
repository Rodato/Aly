## Introductions

Hola everyone,

## Holaaa world.

Good morning, little stars!

## The earth says, 'Hola!'

Heyyyy! How have you been? Yeah, yeah. Hahaha, hello to all. Now let's get down to business, right to the point...

Welcome to this new world of content!

Have  you  ever  gone  to  workshops  or  activities  and  felt  soooo  connected  to everything they said? Or the other way around, the workshops seemed soooo interesting, but the way they were done was boring. Well, here's the solution! 😀 Introducing:

<!-- image -->

An incredible document from which you'll learn a lot.

But what exactly is the The Toolkit? It's a document that will teach  you  how  to  facilitate  and provide  information  on  topics  in cool  ways,  without  dying  in  the attempt ;)

The  Toolkit  is  aimed  at  young people like you who have a base  of  information  and  training on comprehensive sexuality education  or  on  the  prevention of gender-based violence. It will help you guide debates, reflections,  analysis,  and  provide feedback so that each participant can conclude their individual and collective  ideas  on  these  topics. And, obviously, it's called a toolkit because you'll have resources available to choose from to achieve your action for change.

## Who are we?

This  group  is  made  up  of  people from three spaces: Jóvenes Power [1] , CEPAM  Guayaquil [2] and Equimundo [3] .  We've  come  together to give you a tool that will open you up to  a  world  of  possibilities  so  that  you can  achieve  everything  you  want  to talk  about  and  achieve  in  promoting gender equality.

## Why is this document important?

I  can  assure  you  that  this  doc  will convey a lot of confidence and closeness  when  you  read  it  :)  We won't  deny  that  sometimes  there  is a  lot  of  text,  but  the  information  is summarized in the most precise way. It's  true,  there  are  other  toolkits,  but none are like ours, since this one has the soul, life, and heart of those of us who wrote and rewrote it. It has a youth-friendly style, including idioms, slang,  emojis,  and  even  memes  ;)  In short, it's our own essence, and we've added references to youth culture to make you feel comfortable.

This document also covers a broader concept  than  what  we're  going  to cover. It offers theoretical content on the key concepts that are part of this society,  such  as  feminism,  patriarchy, gender-based violence, gender roles, and stereotypes.

It also includes the approaches that will be used to facilitate activities so that it provides an alternative education to what we receive in school.

Finally, it also explains the methodology you can use in your actions for change. In other words, it teaches you the path and means to conduct a youth-to-youth workshop, which we call peer processes.

## HOW DID WE MANAGE TO MAKE THIS

## TOOLKIT?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND AUGUST 2024, IN CLOSE COLLABORATION,  WE,  JÓVENES POWER, CEPAM GYE, AND EQUIMUNDO, MANAGED TO COCREATE THIS TOOLBOX.

<!-- image -->

## Jokes, haha. To achieve this,

Equimundo held two workshops with young facilitators, identifying their needs and proposals for change. Then,  the  Equimundo  team  drafted a  proposed  document,  and  based on  that  document,  we-the  Youth Power  committee-began  reviewing, editing, and adapting it to ensure that the content would be useful to other young facilitators.

ONE DAY WE DEBATED THE

## ONE DAY WE DEBATED THE THEORETICAL POSITIONS ON EACH TOPIC. To finist Equimul

share, e techniqu

Don't worry, no one was hurt. In fact, it  served  to  collectively  agree on the theoretical positions to include.

and lea

To  finish  the  doc,  with  the  help  of Equimundo,  we  held  a  meeting  to share,  experience,  and  socialize  the techniques and activities found in this toolkit,  so  that  all  participants  in  the Jóvenes Power network and CEPAM Guayaquil could validate the content and  learn how  to carry out  each activity.

Finally,  we  rewrote  the  document, added the * Latinx youth style, and that's!

*This is the gender inclusive way to refer to ALL Latin people.

*GOSSIP!

## HOW IS

## THE TOOLKIT

## ORGANIZED?

## THE DOC IS ORGANIZED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER:

## Ch 1...

is about power concepts, that is, content that can help you feel confident when facilitating a youth meeting or workshop. Some topics include the patriarchal system,  machismo,  feminism,  the  social  construction  of  gender  identities, gender-based violence, the boxes of humanity, such as masculinity, femininity, and  others,  the  violence  that  often  occurs  among  adolescents  and  young people, and tips for building healthy relationships.

## About ch 2...

we share the approaches and methodologies you can use for youth facilitation, with the goal of offering an alternative education to what we receive in school 👀 , so that participants can actively participate in the activities you propose.

The approaches and methodologies that make up this toolkit are the popular education  approach,  the  experiential  approach,  the  gender-transformative approach, and the playful learning approach (don't worry,  we'll  explain  what each approach means later).

## For ch 3...

You'll learn the methods and techniques  of  facilitation,  or  in  other words, how to conduct a youthto-youth activity without dying in the  process  :D.  The  methods  teach you  the  way  to  teach  a  youth-toyouth  workshop,  what  we  call  peer processes.  So,  if  the  method  is  the path, participatory techniques are the means of transport. They are the tools used to implement the methodology and  are  integrated  into  the  chosen method in a coherent manner.

## Finall y , in ch 4 ...

We're  sharing  all  the  activities  you can do based on the power concepts and the  methods  and  techniques we  shared  in  the  previous  chapters. They're  super  organized  so  you  can select  the  one  you  want  for  your application ;)

IN EACH CHAPTER, YOU WILL SEE FOOTNOTES REFERRING TO A DIGITAL ANNEX. YOU CAN FIND THIS ON THE CEPAM-G AND EQUIMUNDO WEBSITES (ALONG WITH THIS GUIDE). IT IS A SUPERB DOCUMENT WITH MANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES.

FIND THE DIGIT AL GUIDE AND DIGITAL ANNEX

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## SOOOOO, WE HOPE ALL THAT YOU FIND HERE IS SUPER HELPFUL...

and you can use it in the best possible way in your activities - in communities, towns, schools, neighborhoods, social circles, youth organizations, friends - and in your own life.

Remember, we were thinking of you when co-creating this document :) With this presentation, we invite you to be part of the change we all want to see to achieve equality.

GOOD LUCK, FRIENDS!

## LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT CREATED THIS TOOLBOX:

<!-- image -->

*  [1]  Jóvenes  Power is  a  youth  network  made  up  of  groups  of adolescents and young people from Guayaquil, Ecuador, who seek to take action for change regarding Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) to achieve a life free of violence. These groups include Pasos &amp; Huellas, Fundación Nia Kali, and Movimiento Mi Cometa.

<!-- image -->

[2]  CEPAM Guayaquil is  a  feminist  organization  that  works  to  raise awareness of the consequences of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). Through specialized services that include psychological, social, and  legal  care,  we  provide  comprehensive  support  so  that  victims can  exercise  their  right  to  a  life  free  from  violence.  This  document was created within the framework of the Feminist Futures Free from Violence project, coordinated by Fós Feminista.

<!-- image -->

[3]  Equimundo:  Center  for  Masculinities  and  Social  Justice is  an organization dedicated to achieving gender equality and social justice by  transforming  intergenerational  patterns  of  harm  and  promoting caring,  nonviolence,  and  shared  responsibility  among  boys  and  men throughout their lives.

## THE PATRIARCHAL SYSTEM AND MACHISMO \_ 1.1

The Barbie movie has taught us that  patriarchy  and  machismo  not only affect women  but  also  men and  diverse  people.  This  movie  also showed  us  one  of  the  perspectives of feminism, like when all the Barbies organized  to  reclaim  their  identity and remembered their abilities to be whatever they want to be /u1f645\_1f3fb /.notdef /.notdef .

Be  careful,  there  is  more  than  one feminism.  That's  why  we  call  them 'feminisms'.

In this  section,  we  will  explain  how this patriarchal system works, what machismo  is,  and  how  feminisms  can be a path toward the pursuit of equity among the multiple gender diversities.

<!-- image -->

## THE PATRIARCHY

Patriarchy  is  a  system  of  social  organization  in  which  key  positions  of  power (political,  economic,  social,  religious  and  military)  are  held,  exclusively  or predominantly, by men

ONU Mujeres defines patriarchy as follows:

women. Traditionally, societies have been organized in such a way that property ownership, residence, offspring, as well

as decision-making in all areas of life, have been the domain of men. The foundations for this phenomenon often invoke

biological reasons (women are naturally more suited to being caregivers, for example) and continue to underpin many types

A traditional form of social organization that usually is the base of gender inequality where ... more importance is conferred to men , and all that being a man entails, than to women. A traditional form of social organization that is often the basis of gender inequality, where [...] more importance is given to men and everything that being a man entails than to women. Traditionally, societies have been organized in such a way that property ownership, residence, offspring, as well as decision-making in all areas of life, have been the domain of men. The foundations for this phenomenon often invoke biological reasons (women are naturally more suited to being caregivers, for example) and continue to underpin many types of gender discrimination '.

<!-- image -->

I'll also tell you that the patriarchy 'has been such a lamp' In addition to developing power relations, the patriarchy imposes the obligation to be heterosexual 🤨 😡 . Patriarchy, don't mess with us. 🤨 😡 .

## THIS IS CALLED HETEROPATRIARCHY.

<!-- image -->

## THE HETERO PATRIARCHY 😤

It refers to a sociopolitical  system in which the male gender and heterosexuality have supremacy over other genders and over other sexual orientations. It emphasizes that discrimination  against  both  women and LGBTQI+ people is based on the same sexist social principle.

## EL MACHISMO / SEXISM  3

Sexism  is  a  set  of  cultural  attitudes, norms and behaviors that strengthen and preserve the patriarchy. In other  words,  it  is  a  practice  within the patriarchy that reflects the belief  in  the  superiority  of  men  over women and the practices commonly considered  'manly'  over  any  other. Machismo exalts, as masculine values, manliness,  virility  and  the  power  of men,  assigning  to  them  the  use  of violence and force.

The  term  'machista'  is  primarialy used in Latin America to refer to the sexist  attitudes  and  conduct  and homophobia of men that offends and hurts women, LGBTQI+ people and 'non-masculine' men, violating their integrity, their opportunities and their rights.

T h e h e t e r o c e n t r i c a n d heteronormative  nature  of  the patriarchy is based on the assumption that is it 'normal' to be heterosexual and what is weird or what deviates from the norm, is to be gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer. The patriarchy i s   profoundly  homo/lesbo/bi/ transphobic. How shameful...

It's  incredibly  hard  to  see  how  these social issues, which are still part of our context,  function  in  such  a  way  that when  we  look  at  them  with  a  more informed and critical perspective, they resonate deeply.

<!-- image -->

## The costs/effects of patriarchy and machismo in society 😐

- It makes boys feel superior to girls.
- It  normalizes and increases the use of violence between men and by men against women and people of other genders.
- Patriarchy develops gender stereotypes and influences the way institutions and  states  provide  opportunities  to  people  (in  some  countries,  being  gay  is criminalized).
- The costs of patriarchy not only affect relationships between people, but also affect the environment, as it promotes male superiority over natural resources and stigmatizes caring practices.
- The patriarchal system promotes gender discrimination, abusing male power over the feminine and diverse, and requires the use of violence to maintain its power over others.

## FEMINISM

## AND THE FIGHT AGAINST THE PATRIARCHY

<!-- image -->

FEMINISM 7 REFERS TO THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL MOVEMENTS THAT FORMALLY BEGAN AT THE END OF THE 18TH CENTURY AND THAT INVOLVED GROUP AWARENESS 8  OF WOMEN ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS.

Throughout history, feminist movements around the world have fought against the oppression, domination, and exploitation that women have experienced at the hands of patriarchy and have demanded that states guarantee their rights as citizens on par with men. Feminism does not seek fewer rights for men, but it does seek equal rights for all people, and therefore, it also benefits men.

## INTERSECTIONALITY

A SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY THAT EXAMINES HOW THE INTERACTION OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF SOCIALLY AND CULTURALLY CREATED DISCRIMINATION AND PRIVILEGE CONTRIBUTE TO SYSTEMATIC INEQUALITY.

According to intersectionality, traditional models of oppression based  on  ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation,  religion,  nationality,  age, social class, and physical or intellectual abilities  are  interrelated  and  create  a hierarchical system of oppression that increases  the  level  of  discrimination people face due to the intersection of the diverse characteristics they hold.

This  is  as  far  as  we've  come  in  this section.  As  we  told  you,  patriarchy and machismo have developed gender  stereotypes  and  roles  based on the sex you were assigned at birth, and they claim that gender roles are innate  to  people  based  on  their  sex. 🤦 Please, keep reading so you have arguments  to  support  that  gender is  a  social  construct  that  shapes  us throughout lifeee.

## The Social Constructions of Gender Identities 1.2 \_

WE HAVE ALL TALKED ABOUT SEX AND GENDER AT SOME POINT, AND SOMETIMES WE GET CONFUSED OR BELIEVE THEY ARE THE SAME (LOCAL AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS, TEACHERS, DOCTORS, STATE INSTITUTIONS, THE ARTS INDUSTRY, AND HISTORY ITSELF DO THIS 🙄 /.notdef ).

But in reality, there is a big difference, and we'll explain it here.

## 1.2.1 SEX AND GENDER 9

Sex is  a  category  that  refers  to  the genitals, gonads, chromosomes, hormones,  organs  of  the  sexual  and reproductive system, and other biological characteristics, both internal and external, that people are born  with. Gender  is a social and  personal  construct  about  how we  would  like  to  present  ourselves physically and as a person to society.

the binary system

## How are people raised , educated , and socialized by gender? 10

The differentiated socialization process imposed by the binary gender system molds us so that our individual identities reflect the norms of traditional models. Men must develop a  'masculine identity,' and women, a 'feminine identity.'

## Gender Identities: CIS, TRANS, Intersex,  Non-Binary,  Queer,  Fluid, and Gender Non-Conforming

Gender identity is  the  way  a  person perceives  themselves.  According  to the binary system, a person's gender identity refers to whether or not they  identify  with  the  sex  they  were assigned  at  birth.  It  addresses  the appearance  and  feelings  related  to people's self-concept as psychosocial and sexual beings, and the individual and internal experience of living gender.

## Are  gender  roles  and  f amily  the only  thing  that  defines  a  person's identity?

Of course not. Gender isn't the only  thing  that  constructs  people's identities. Other categories, such as social class, ethnicity, race, and religion, also influence this. Furthermore, people's internal definitions and external expectations can vary widely.

Other social institutions, such as churches, the educational system, the media, the film and music industries,  and  government  entities, also  have  a  significant  influence  on the socialization of binary gender identities.  They  constantly  reinforce the beliefs, attitudes, values, and behaviors that the binary system indicates.

## AND NOW, THE MILLIONDOLLAR QUESTION: HAVE WE ACHIEVED GENDER EQUALITY? 🙏 13

Well...  :(  We're  not  going  to  deny that it's a difficult question to answer. However, we  must recognize that various activisms, organizations, and  militancy  groups  of  women,  the LGBTQI+ community, and trans men and women have developed struggles that  have  managed to influence and bring about changes not only in laws but also in society to achieve greater acceptance, inclusion, and rights. But we also won't deny that many changes are still needed because women and LGBTQI+  people continue to face barriers and discrimination when  trying  to  access  jobs,  services, educational opportunities, and more. Inequality  persists  and  continues  to be very violent.

## 1.3

## The BOXES of Humanity , masculinity , femininity , and others (14)

The categories of masculinity and femininity generated  by patriarchy perpetuate rigid notions of how to be men (being strong, being a protector, etc.) and  women  (being  beautiful, delicate,  etc.),  thus  limiting  women's empowerment and generating gender  inequality.  These  categories sustain patriarchal structures of power inequality between men and women. In  fact,  they  not  only  harm  women, but also men and non-binary people 15 .

But, framing the boxes of Humanity means reclaiming the positive aspects attributed  to  both  genders  so  that every person, regardless of their gender  identity  or  sex,  can  decide to incorporate them into their way of being. This means, at the same time, REJECTING the aspects of both boxes that  negatively  affect  us  and  others. For  example,  repressing  emotions  is extremely  painfulll  for  anyone  :(  and it's something attributed to men. These  decisions  must:  be  based  on individual choices as people and human beings; aim to  promote  wellbeing; and not be imposed based on gender 16 .

## 1.4 GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (GBV) violence, among others.

Gender-based  violence  (GBV)  refers  to  any  threat  or harmful act directed at a person or group based on their sex,  gender  identity  or  expression,  sexual  characteristics, or  sexual  orientation.  It  manifests  itself  in  various  forms, including  physical,  sexual,  economic,  and  psychological violence, among others.

## VIOLENCE AMONG ADOLESCENT S AND YOUNG PEOPLE

## DATING VIOLENCE  18

Adolescence and young adulthood are often periods in life when people begin to experience affection, sexual attraction, and fall in love. However, dating relationships are also often influenced by expectations, roles, and gender stereotypes, which can lead to violence dynamics. 19 😥

## Gender-Based Violence in the School Environment 20

Gender-based violence in the school environment can be defined as acts or threats of sexual, physical, or psychological violence that occur in and around schools, on the way to and from school, and through cyberspace. Key examples of gender-based violence  in  the  school  environment  that  are  frequently  experienced  by  women, LGBTQI+ people, and non-binary students, and that are often considered 'normal' behavior, include:

- Bullying/School Bullying
- Homophobic School Bullying
- Bullying
- Sexual Harassment

On  the  other  hand,  gender-based  violence  that  manifests  itself  through cyberspace may involve one or more of the following actions:

- Cyberbullying
- Cybercontrol
- Cybermisogyny
- Digital gender-based violence
- Symbolic cyberviolence
- Sextortion  21

BEING VIOLENT OR ENDURING THE VIOLENCE OF ANOTHER MAN DOESN'T MAKE YOU MORE OF A MAN, IT JUST MAKES YOU ANOTHER ACCOMPLICE IN

THE PATRIARCHAL REGIME :(

Symbolic cyberviolence

/ Sextortion 21

In the school environment, girls, adolescent women, and young women from the LGBTQI+ and gender-diverse communities are more likely to experience psychological  bullying,  cyberbullying,  harassment,  and  sexual  violence.  Boys and men, adolescents, and young men face higher rates of corporal punishment with the expectation that they must endure it like 'real men.'

Experiencing and/or witnessing gender-based violence in the school environment has a very negative impact on physical and emotional well-being and health, and often leads to lower academic performance. It can also harm their  cognitive  and  emotional  development  and  be  one  of  the  factors  that 'normalize' gender-based violence in the future.

TO PREVENT AND REDUCE GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS, IT IS NECESSARY TO ADOPT HOLISTIC APPROACHES THAT CONSIDER THE WHOLE SCHOOL, KEY STRATEGIES OF WHICH INCLUDE:

- Effective school leadership and community engagement to create safe and gender-sensitive learning environments.
- Establish and enforce a code of conduct and coexistence.
- Develop the capacity of teachers and educational staff to build respectful environments for adolescents and young people.
- Improve reporting, follow-up, and accountability procedures.
- Provide  immediate  and  effective  responses  to  incidents  of  gender-based violence in the school environment.
- Strengthen surveillance in physical learning environments such as restrooms, classrooms, school access routes, etc.
- Involve  parents  and  student  representatives  in  promoting  and  building healthy environments.
- Empower students about children's rights, participation, and gender equality -you can use the activities in this guide to do this!

## SELF-ESTEEM ✨ 22

It  is  the  perception  we  have of ourselves, influenced by our experiences and interpersonal relationships.

A study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018 indicated that 1 in 4 people between the ages of 7 and 17 have low self-esteem and report symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. Low self-esteem in adolescents can lead to emotional and mental problems such as depression and suicide. According to the WHO, in 2023, suicide was the third leading cause of death among young people aged 20 to 24 in the Americas  23 ...

The following table compares the characteristics of high and low self-esteem.

## SELF-CARE 🌸 24

It's about taking responsibility for actions  that  strengthen  our  overall well-being and prevent disease.

This includes taking care of our physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual health. The key principles of self-care are:

<!-- image -->

Engaging life: It makes us protagonists in our health care and is a voluntary process.

<!-- image -->

Responsibility  and  commitment: It  is  a  daily  task  and  is  supported  by both  the  healthcare  system  and  our support networks.

<!-- image -->

Certainty of improvement: By practicing self-care, we seek to improve our health.

Personal development: It  requires constantly  strengthening  our  selfconcept,  self-control,  self-esteem, self-acceptance, and resilience.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Buen tratO/TREATMENT 💖

This term, coined by feminist psychologist Fina Sanz, refers to creating healthy relationships as opposed to  abuse.  Instead  of  basing our relationships on power and abuse, a model of coexistence based on and for good treatment is proposed, which includes:

<!-- image -->

Personal, relational, and collective space: Create good treatment in all areas of our lives.

<!-- image -->

Abandon old beliefs: Leave behind values and behaviors that reproduce abuse.

<!-- image -->

New values: Develop ways of relating based on respect for differences, cooperation, solidarity, harmony, and peace.

Equitable relationship

## HOW TO HAVE HEALTHY EMOTIONAL BONDS?

With the following tips, we can achieve more beautiful and healthy relationships. Remember, consent is the most important thing. ♥ 🥰 L

Sincerity and honesty: To express your thoughts, feelings, and concerns in a respectful and reciprocal manner. Be transparent in all interactions.

Mutual  respect: Recognizing  and valuing  the  other  person's  opinions, boundaries, and needs.

- Support and reciprocity: Both people must be willing to be present and provide emotional support during difficult times.
- Trust: To ensure that everyone feels safe.
- Equitable relationship

opinions or dablescens are not heard.

<!-- image -->

It's  essential  to  emphasize  that  in  a healthy relationship, there should be  no  abuse  of  any  kind ,  whether physical,  emotional,  or  verbal.  There should  be  no  insults,  humiliation,  or any  form  of  violence.  Each  person should feel  safe  and  respected  at  all times  25 .

## And with regard to adults, how can I relate? 26

Often, relationships between adolescents  and  adults  can  be  very hierarchical,  where  the  voices  and opinions of adolescents are not heard.

Despite all the technology and innovation available, adolescents are still discriminated against because of their age and supposed lack of experience.

## THERE ARE A COUPLE OF CONCEPTS THAT HELP US UNDERSTAND WHY:

this can have dangerous consequences.

## ADULT-CENTRICITY

Superiority of adults over younger generations.

Privileges simply for being an adult.

Being an adult is the model ideal of personhood: considering children, adolescents and young people as unfinished.

## ADULTISM

Doubting the capacities of adolescents for being younger.

Not listening to adolescents.

Examples: 'when you're older, you can give your opinion', 'it is better for me to decide because I have more experience than you.'

Despite  all  the  technology  and  innovation  available,  adolescents  are  still discriminated against because of their age and supposed lack of experience. However, it is sometimes necessary for adults, as those responsible for caring for their children, to make socialized decisions with their children for their own good. That is, we should not assume a maturity they don't possess, as ignoring this can have dangerous consequences.

## Interpersonal Communication (27)

THE MOST DIRECT WAY TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION IS TO LEARN TO LISTEN. ALMOST EVERYTHING COULD BE IMPROVED BY LISTENING BETTER, FROM FAMILY MATTERS TO WORK ISSUES.

Becoming good listeners entails changes in attitudes and behaviors because listening involves deconstructing stereotypes, attitudes, and power dynamics determined by gender norms to develop communication skills and practices based  on  respect  and  equal  rights  for  men  and  women,  rather  than  on  a paradigm of male superiority and female inferiority.

Here are some red and green flags to keep in mind.

(27) Borrowed from: Change Trial Manual. 2027. Sonke Gender Justice Network, South Africa 2017, páginas 94- 97.

## RED FLAGS

🚩🚩👎

Believing you already know what the speaker wants to say before they have finished.

Thinking about how to solve what you perceive as the speaker's problem.

Treating the discussion as a competition.

Trying to influence or impress the speaker.

Stopping listening when people talk about 'equal opportunities.'

## GREEN FLAGS

🟢🟩👍

Showing respect and empathy for the speaker.

Keeping your mind open to new ideas.

Focusing completely on the conversation.

Making eye contact. Avoiding actions that may cause distraction. Showing affirmative nods and appropriate facial expressions.

Speaking long enough for the other person to speak as well.

Asking questions. Paraphrasing.

## 2.1 Popular Education

HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT POPULAR EDUCATION? WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S CALLED POPULAR?

'Popular' doesn't mean trendy, like a song or dance, but rather something that is unique to the town, neighborhood, communes, and communities and is aimed at the people who live in their area.

Popular  education  has  emerged  as an alternative to traditional education and takes into account the knowledge and  sharing  of  both  teachers  and participants. Have you ever felt bored in  class  or  given  overly-complicated homework  and  felt  like  you  weren't learning anything? Or it also happens that the teacher talks, we're all forced to listen, and no one is motivated to express an opinion. These situations characterize traditional education, despite its strong suitability for planning, as it is a 'set of

<!-- image -->

strategies,  procedures,  and  actions organized  and  planned  by  teachers, consciously and thoughtfully, with the aim of enabling student learning and achieving the stated objectives.' However,  this  form  of  education  has become linear, monotonous, routine, and, unfortunately, boring ☹ . #sad

Be careful, there are exceptions, some  teachers  who  seek  to  break away from this traditional style. (We love  you,  teachers 😅 ) We must also consider that each generation always brings change, and education should be open to these proposals.

Well,  we  can  tell  you  that  popular education does.

that a better world, a "utopia," is possible as long as people take

responsibility for changing their

In popular education, you can respectfully debate and question, address topics of interest based on  participants' proposals, create a space  of  trust  to  encourage  active participation among children, and even implement recreational activities such  as  games,  body  dynamics,  and crafts.  The  most  important  aspect  of popular education is the integration of rules for living together and, above all, motivating  you  to  continue  learning.

🤓☝

## WITHOUT NEGLECTING THE THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTION, POPULAR EDUCATION IS DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:

'A structured and systematic process of training and capacity building aimed at building a just and humane society. It proposes that a better world, a 'utopia,' is possible as long as people take responsibility for changing their reality and are willing to critically analyze it and jointly articulate proposals for its transformation  28 '.

<!-- image -->

Therefore,  popular  education  has  a clear  intention  to  transform  society toward the achievement of conditions of equality and justice. In Latin America,  popular  education  has  its roots  in  the  work  and  thought  of Brazilian  educator  and  philosopher Paulo Freire, and has historically been closely linked to the struggles of urban and rural social movements for social justice. Thank you, Paulooo ☺

A common component of popular education

## 2.2

## EXPERIENTIAL METHODOLOGY (30)

A common component of popular education is the use of  a  methodology  known  as 'experiential,' as  it  is  based  on  the  experience and beliefs of each participant, focusing on their individual and social construction in a specific historical context.

<!-- image -->

(30) Adapted from: 'Promoviendo procesos de sensibilización y capacitación en género y masculinidad con niñez, adolescencia y juventud', REDMAS, Nicaragua 2008.

## THE USE OF EXPERIENTIAL METHODOLOGY HAS MANY ADVANTAGES FOR EDUCATIONAL WORK WITH ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE:

Rights

- It connects the topics covered with  specific  individual  experiences, connecting participants with feelings and emotions, thereby enabling them to express themselves.
- It provides guidelines for open and honest dialogue in a safe and trusting environment.
- It generates a process of personal rethinking: goals, dreams, relationships, personal habits, personal and professional development, etc.

## \_ 2.3

## The Gender Transformative Approach (GT A)

- It  allows  for  body  awareness  and incorporates  relaxation  and  healing techniques.
- It breaks isolation and loneliness, as by  sharing  experiences,  participants realize that their peers have experienced or are experiencing similar situations.

<!-- image -->

When you apply popular education along with an experiential methodology to gender stereotypes, roles, and relations, you promote a gender transformative approach (GTA).

This involves facilitating processes of reflection and analysis to critically review attitudes, values, and behaviors resulting from our gender socialization that cause harm to others and to ourselves, in order to transform them in such a way that they contribute to equal rights and opportunities for all people, regardless of their gender identity.

IN OUR EDUCATIONAL AND AWARENESS-RAISING WORK AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE, THE APPLICATION OF A GENDER-TRANSFORMATIVE APPROACH IS SUUUPER RELEVANT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:

<!-- image -->

Harmful gender-based social norms affect adolescents' and young people's self-esteem, behaviors, and  relationships with each  other. All of this has direct impacts on their academic  performance,  health,  life opportunities,  and  leads  to  bullying and other types of violence ☹ .

<!-- image -->

Compared  to  more  top-down educational approaches that impose certain  ways  of  thinking  on  young people, GTA can achieve significant and permanent long-term changes.

<!-- image -->

The butterfly effect: small changes achieved in the attitudes, beliefs, and  values  of  those  who  participate in  training  spaces  can  multiply  and effect changes in behaviors and relationships  in  families,  classrooms, friendship groups, and the community.

## The Playful Approach To Learning (31)

In  the  context  of  educational  processes  with  a  genderreplacing  the  analytical-critical  approach  with transformative approach, the use of playful tools allows you to make learning fun, enjoyable, and engaging for the group of participants without them even realizing it. This doesn't mean leisure, but rather building playful dynamics that  reinforce  and  foster  the  desired learning and transformation processes ,  adapted  to  the  topics to be taught, the ages and gender identities of those participating, and the available spaces. n ssa unsap

- 2 It is socially interactive, thus encouraging peer dialogue and socialization.

## What does ' F acilit ation ' mean? (32)

In  general  terms,  facilitation  is  about making things happen easily, or about making something possible. Facilitation is an enabling and guiding process  that  creates  and  supports  a pleasant and safe space for meaningful participation  and  interaction  for  the group of participants. Facilitation involves  using  participatory  methods and techniques to stimulate reflection and analysis, thereby creating  a  horizontal  and  supportive environment that is conducive to mutual  learning  and  empowerment, and that is both engaging and fun.

## FACILITATION IN GTA PROCESSES MEANS:

- Taking  responsibility  for  planning and implementing reflection, analysis, and learning processes that empower and engage participants.
- Focusing attention on participants as key players in the learning process.
- Deconstructing power relations between  educators  and  participants, and  among  participants  themselves, especially when the group is diverse.

## 2.6 Tips for Power F acilit ation (33)

THE FOLLOWING TIPS WILL HELP ENCOURAGE AND CREATE A RESPECTFUL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS FEEL COMFORTABLE SHARING THEIR OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES, AS WELL AS LISTENING TO AND LEARNING FROM OTHERS  34 .

<!-- image -->

Promote movement and interaction.

- Create and maintain a welcoming and safe environment
- Avoid criticism
- Promote inclusion
- Address participants' concerns
- Know and use referral services
- Manage conflicts respectfully
- Appreciate honesty and transparency
- Promote movement and interaction.

- Manage your time.
- Show respect for your presence and appearance.
- Be careful with topics that could re-traumatize any participant.
- Avoid letting discussions stray too far from the key messages

threatened by the sensitive topics being discussed.

## 2.7

## Addressing Sensitive or T aboo Topics and Dealing with Difficult Situations (35)

## GENDER-TRANSFORMATIVE TRAINING PROCESSES OFTEN ADDRESS SENSITIVE AND CULTURALLY TABOO TOPICS.

If  participants become restless, lose focus, try to sabotage the discussion and dialogue, or engage in aggressive behavior, this can often be a sign that they feel threatened by the sensitive topics being discussed.

<!-- image -->

During facilitation, you can strategically use your personal experience with taboo topics to encourage  participants  to  open  up and participate more fully in the learning process.

You should always challenge controversial or scandalous statements and allow them to unpack the biases behind them. Avoid engaging  in direct conflict or titfor-tat discussions with individual participants;  instead,  invite  them  to explain  why  they  feel  the  way  they do.  When  they  have  done  so,  ask the  group  if  they  agree  or  if  they have  other  opinions  or  perspectives on  the  topic.  Otherwise,  present  an alternative opinion to stimulate debate and  discussion.  At  the  end  of  the discussion,  cite  statistics  or  concrete examples,  if  possible,  to  clarify  the issue, but without humiliating or belittling  the  person  or  people  who made the controversial statement.

TO OPINIONS ON TOPICS

In  most  cases,  especially  when  the statements refer to stereotypes, norms,  and  deeply  rooted  cultural phobias, it is highly unlikely that participants will openly and immediately change their minds. However,  the  group  of  participants will  be  more  willing  to  consider  and, hopefully, adopt other opinions later.

<!-- image -->

KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME VERY SENSITIVE TOPICS CAN BE DEALT WITH HUMOR: YOU SHOULD KNOW WHEN TO LAUGH AND WHEN TO LISTEN, AND BE OPEN TO OPINIONS ON TOPICS THAT MAY NOT REFLECT YOUR OWN VALUES (SUCH AS OPINIONS ON ALCOHOL, DRUGS, OR SEXUAL BEHAVIOR).

## HOW TO DEAL WITH FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS (36)

BEFORE BEGINNING TRAINING PROCESSES, CREATE A  LIST  OF  THE  EMOTIONAL  SUPPORT  RESOURCES AVAILABLE AT THE SCHOOL AND IN THE COMMUNITY TO WHICH YOU CAN REFER PARTICIPANTS, IF NECESSARY.

Remembering and sharing past experiences can provoke a wide range of  emotions  in  and  among participants, and they should feel able to express them freely. The same can  happen  when  reflecting  on  and analyzing situations of abuse of power, violence,  and  discrimination.  When someone  shares  emotional  personal stories, show your appreciation, understanding, and empathy.

For  some,  these  conversations  can provoke  feelings  of  sadness,  anger, guilt, and shame, which can be expressed  through  crying.  Don't  be afraid  to  allow  participants  to  share their emotions or cry.

## RECOGNIZE

## THE EMOTION THEY ARE SHARING AND SHOW EMPATHY.

IT'S IMPORTANT TO LET THEM SHARE, BUT ALSO TO MOVE ON AND KEEP THE ACTIVITY FLOWING.

S3

<!-- image -->

If  any  participant  needs  help,  you can  talk  to  them  privately  afterward to  provide  them  with  information  on where they can seek support, referring to the list of resources you compiled.

Openness and honesty when sharing feelings and emotions are a sign of a trusting  and  safe  environment  and are essential for achieving group cohesion.  They  are  also  essential  for recognizing  the  harm  and  damage that violence and discrimination cause to individuals, teams, and work environments.

Did you know? To implement a gendertransformative approach in educational processes with adolescents and young people, and to impact participants, we can use a variety of participatory methods and techniques.

BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW THEY DIFFER?

CEPAM

PRAYAO UIL

A PARTICIPATORY METHOD IS THE PATH, THE WAY WE CHOOSE TO IMPLEMENT AN ACTIVITY. IT REFERS TO THE MODALITY AND FORM OF THE ACTIVITY, AND INCLUDES METHODS SUCH AS WORKSHOPS, SEMINARS, AND TALKS.

So, if the method is the path...

Participatory techniques are the means of transportation, such as airplanes, cars, and bicycles, that allow us to travel that path. They are the tools used to implement the methodology and are integrated into the chosen method in a coherent manner. Participatory techniques are pedagogical tools that facilitators can use to motivate participants.

An example of a participatory technique is workshops, which can consist of a series of different techniques that follow a sequence according to a plan.

The techniques you can use in a workshop can be:

- Group work
- Plenary session
- Role-play
- Among others

All  the  techniques  applied  together  contribute  to  achieving  the  workshop objectives. NOTE: They should NOT be considered ends in themselves, but should be used in relation to specific educational learning objectives.

It should be kept in mind that participatory techniques are merely tools that enable awareness, empowerment, and motivation to continue learning.

In  addition  to  participatory  methods  and  techniques,  there  are  also dynamics , which involve activities that greatly help break the ice, build trust, socialize, get to know each other and make friends, overcome shyness, and encourage the group during moments of fatigue or lack of concentration.

## 3.1 Educational Methods

Now that we know what educational methods are, we'll share with you some that you can put into practice:

- Training Workshops
- Forum
- Film Forum
- Debates
- Talks

## 3.1.1 THE TRAINING WORKSHOP 38

The workshop is a learning space that aims to reflect on the knowledge, values, attitudes, and practices held regarding a specific issue in a group or community, and which are expressed in the daily life of each participant 39 .

## 3.1.2 THE FORUM

The forum is a tool that provides an opportunity to generate a space for dialogue and debate among adolescents and young people.

(39) If you'd like to learn more about educational methods, check out the digital appendix to this toolkit: p.40

## 3.1.3 THE FILM FORUM 40

In the film forum, we immerse ourselves in  a  debate  or  discussion  on  a  specific topic,  using  a  film  or  video  related  to that topic as a basis.

## 3.1.4 DEBATES 41

Debates  are  fun  and  a  great  learning tool  that  we  can  use  in  our  work  with adolescents and young adults. Everyone loves  seeing  different  speakers  take opposing sides of the same topic and try to win people over with their arguments.

3.1.5 TALKS 42

Giving a talk, particularly to people your age, can be nerve-wracking,

but it serves to inform, convince, or persuade, although we can go

further. We want the audience to be emotionally engaged and inspired

to take their own actions for gender equality, no matter how big or small.

The goal of your talk should be to lift your audience to a greater

understanding, to inspire them with your story so that their lives can

change with your experience.

## 3.2

## Educational Techniques (43)

## HIIIII! WE KNOW, THIS CHAPTER IS A BIT LONG, BUT I ASSURE YOU IT WILL BE VERY ENRICHING FOR YOU AND YOUR ACTIVITIES.

Remember  that when we refer to educational techniques, we are talking about pedagogical tools for implementing the methodology.

They are super important because facilitators  can  use  the  ones  they  like best to motivate participants.

## 01 CULT URAL MODELS OF MEN AND WOMEN (45)

## ACTIVITY ON GENDER AND SOCIALIZATION OF GENDER IDENTITIES AND ROLES  46

(Identification of gender characteristics)

<!-- image -->

TIME:

2 hours

## OBJECTIVE:

Participants  will  be  able  to  identify the characteristics associated with being men and women in their culture and understand the relationship between  biological  and  anatomical characteristics (sex) and socially constructed characteristics (gender).

## KEY MESSAGES

- 'Sex' is a biological and anatomical category that makes men and women different.
- 'Gender' is a social and cultural category that leads to inequalities between women and men (attitudes, values, feelings, roles, opportunities, rights, access to resources).
- Society attributes different characteristics, attitudes, and behaviors to men and women and assigns them values. Generally, everything related to being a man is given greater social and cultural value.

## MATERIALS

- 2 old newspapers
- 4 large sheets of paper (flipchart paper)
- 6 plastic bags
- 2 balloons
- 4 sheets of cardstock in different colors
- 4 sheets of crepé paper
- Both men and women, to a large extent, assimilate the characteristics, roles, and identities that their culture deems  appropriate  for  them,  and when they deviate from these, they are  invariably  ridiculed,  scorned, marginalized, or punished.
- A  person's  'gender'  is  socially constructed based on their biological 'sex.' A newborn boy or girl is identified by the presence of a penis or a vagina and  is  raised  according  to  society's vision of how men and women should be, think, feel, and act.
- 1 piece of masking tape
- 4 markers of different colors
- 1 stapler
- 1 pair of scissors
- 4 sticks or rulers (about 50 cm long each)
- Glue

## PREPARATION

- Prepare materials in advance in 'packages.'
- If it's not possible to obtain all of these materials, try to obtain most of them.

## STEPS TO FOLLOW

## STEP 1:

## Instructions

⏱ 5 minutes

1

Divide participants into 6 same-sex groups (3 men and 3 women) with 4 to 5 members in each group. Non-binary individuals can decide for themselves whether they want to participate in a men's or women's group, or form their own group.

2

3

4

5

6

Give each group the materials described above. Explain that each group has been given exactly the same materials, detailing what they are.

Tell the men's groups that they must use the materials they have been given to create a model of a man from their culture/city, incorporating traits, attitudes, values, and behaviors that society considers appropriate for men. Emphasize that they are not being asked to create the 'ideal' or 'perfect' man, but rather one typical of their own society/culture. Similarly, for the women's groups, indicate that they must create a model of a woman from their culture/city (a realistic one, not an ideal version).

Inform the groups that they can use other materials they have or have access to. They can be as creative as they want!

Tell the groups that at the end of the exercise, their created models will be judged based on three criteria: height, stability, and physical beauty.

Ask the groups if they have any questions and clarify any concerns they may have.

- Tell the groups they have 30 minutes to create their models of men and women. 7

## STEP 2:

## Group Work: Creating Models of Men and Women

⏱ 30 minutes

- During group work, observe the internal dynamics of each group: who makes decisions and how; leadership and coordination methods and styles; who is excluded and why; types of power and how they are used; use of language (verbal and body language); physical contact, etc. 1
- Also, record the relationships established between groups : competition, collaboration, communication, use of language (verbal and body language), physical contact, etc. 2
- Notify the groups when there are only 10 minutes left. 3
- T ell the groups that they can give their model a name if they wish. 4
- If necessary, allow a few more minutes to allow all groups to finish their models. 5

## STEP 3:

## Plenary Session

⏱ 30 minutes

## PRESENTATION OF MODELS OF MEN AND WOMEN

- Invite participants to return to the plenary session and form a semicircle with their chairs facing the top of the room, but remaining together as groups. 1
- Decide with the participants whether the men's groups or the women's groups will present their models first. 2
- Depending on the prior decision, ask the first men's or women's group to present their model, explaining the characteristics, features, attributes, etc. they have incorporated into their model and why. 3

4

- Jot down anything that stands out and that you would like to ask the group about later.

5

Invite the other groups to ask clarifying questions and make comments, without entering into a deep discussion on this issue.

- Repeat steps 2 through 4 for the following groups, ensuring that the presentations from the men's and women's groups do not overlap. 6

## DISCUSSION AND DEBATE

- Once all groups have presented their models, initiate a discussion using the following questions as a guide. 1
- a) What characteristics do the different models of women have in common? Why?
- b) What differences are there between the models of women? Why?
- c) What other characteristics do women have in your culture that are not expressed in the models? Why not?

Repeat the previous questions for the models of men (or women, if you decide to analyze the models of men first).

- d) Looking more closely at all the models, what characteristics do women and men share in your culture?
- e) Are there characteristics in the models of women that men can also have? (and vice versa) Why?/Why not?

Analyze the dynamics of cooperation and domination within groups (leadership, decision-making, individual and collective initiative, shared responsibility, etc.), using the following questions as a guide and incorporating your own observations into the discussion:

- a) Invite participants to share how they felt while working within the group. (Allow them to differentiate feelings from thoughts and opinions.)
- b) How did you feel about the way decisions were made within the group?
- c) Who took the initiative and how?
- d) Was anyone left out or ignored? Why? How did they feel?
- e) How did cooperation and collaboration occur within each group? What allowed this to happen? What prevented it?

2

3

- f ) Point out the marked differences between the internal coordination and dynamics of groups of men and women.

Analyze the dynamics that occurred between the groups using the following questions as a guide and informing the discussion with your own observations of the relationships that developed between the groups (competition, rivalry, collaboration, coordination, aggression, etc.):

- a) How did competition and rivalry manifest between the groups, and why?
- b) Which groups did you pay more attention to: those of your own sex or those of the 'other' sex? Why?
3. 4 To conclude the discussion, ask participants if they think the exercise would have been different if it had been conducted only with women or only with men. How? Why?

## STEP 4 :

## Judgment!

- ⏱ 5 minutes

1

Remind participants that you said at the beginning that the models would be judged on their height, stability, and physical beauty. In a playful way, discuss these three aspects of each of the female and male models, but without reaching any final conclusions. Complement all groups' work.

- Explain to the group that this was an intentional dynamic to provoke competitiveness 2
- between the groups.
- Ask them to express the ways in which men and women compete and rival each other (men/men, women/women, and men/women)on a daily basis. 4 3

## NOTES FOR THE TEAM FACILIT AT OR

For  men  and  women  who  have never had the opportunity to reflect on  these  issues, the  discovery  that the  inequalities  that  exist  between men and women are not natural can be a truly revelatory and enlightening moment. It is important that participants understand the basic concepts of  sex  and  gender  and  the relationship  between the two before moving on to the following activities.

<!-- image -->

As  a  facilitator, it's  important  to maintain  a  relaxed  approach  to  this activity, keeping in mind the learning objectives.  This  activity,  as  a  starting point  for  a  training  process,  allows participants  to  quickly  get  to  know each  other  and  develop  the  trust and  confidence  essential  for  future activities of a more intimate nature. It also allows you to gain their trust.

Keep a critical eye on the different situations, dynamics, and processes that  emerge as  participants  develop their models and use them to inform moments  of  discussion  and  analysis. Remember that most participants will be reproducing the attitudes, values, and behaviors they have learned as  men  and  women,  not  only  in  the activity  but  also  when  they  interact with each other and with the activity itself.

## 02 SCULPTING POWER

ACTIVITY ABOUT GENDER AND POWER  48

TIME 30 minutes

<!-- image -->

## OBJECTIVES

1. Reflect  on  the  impact  of  power when it is used to gain domination and control over others..
2. Identify other types of power that involve cooperation and collaboration.

## MATERIALS

Ample space to move around.

## KEY MESSAGES

- There are different types of power: power over, power with, power to, and power within.
- Power doesn't always have to be used to control and abuse other people.

## STEPS TO FOLLOW

STEP 1:

## Sculptures of power

⏱ 15 minutes

1

Form 4 mixed groups. Assign and give each group one of the following definitions related to power. Ask them not to let the other groups see their definition.

## Power OVER:

The power to dominate others. Power is seen as external control over something or someone else. The source is authority.

## Power WITH:

The power of mutual support, solidarity, and collaboration; this comes when groups work together toward a common goal. The source is other human beings.

## Power FOR:

The power that comes from the ability to achieve something. The source is one's knowledge, education, skills, or talent.

## INNER Power:

The power of internal beliefs, attitudes, and habits. This has to do with a person's sense of self-worth and self-knowledge. This source can be self-confidence, faith, ideology, or sense of purpose.

Each group has 5 minutes to produce a human sculpture that represents the concept of power they have been given. To do so, they must discuss the concept and agree on the main ideas, representations, and relationships they want to convey in their human sculpture. They may use other props, if they wish, but no written or spoken words.

2

74

3

Invite the first group to present their human sculpture. Now ask the other participants to share their thoughts on the type of power just shown.

Allow for different ideas to be expressed and a discussion to take place. Conclude by asking the group to share and explain the power they displayed through the sculpture. If the group wishes, encourage further discussion about the differences between the group's intention and the interpretations of the other participants.

- 4 Repeat the previous step for the other three groups.
- 5 Allow time for further reflection, observations, and questions.

## STEP 2:

## Analyze how power is used and by whom

- ⏱ 15 minutes

1

Ask: What characteristics of a person's or group's identity make them more likely to use 'power over' others, and in what situations? (Probe here: gender, race, age, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, immigration status/background, etc., and how they intersect; situations they have witnessed in the school setting (such as bullying), community)

2

3

4

5

What are the consequences for individuals and groups when others use power over them?

How does 'power over' relate to bullying? What are the consequences for students who are bullied?

Ask participants to give examples of how they have seen the other three types of power used:

- a) in families
- b) in the community
- c) in schools
- d) in society in general

Summarize the 4 types of power. There are different types of power that can be used in different ways:

## POWER OVER:

Control over someone or a situation negatively, usually associated with repression, force, corruption, discrimination, and abuse. Exercising this type of power means taking it away from someone else and then using it to dominate and prevent others from taking it: a situation in which not everyone wins.

6

## Power WITH:

Power based on collective strength and/or numbers: having power with people or groups, finding common ground, and building a common goal that benefits everyone involved in the relationship. This type of power multiplies individual talents and knowledge and is based on support, solidarity, and collaboration.

## Power TO:

The ability to shape and influence one's own life. It means having the ideas, knowledge, skills, money, and ability to convince each other and others to do something. With many people who have this type of power, we create 'power with.'

## INNER Power:

A type of power related to a person's sense of self-worth and self-knowledge. It is related to that person's ability to imagine a better life for themselves and to have hope and the feeling that they can change the world: the feeling that they have rights as a human being. It involves trusting yourself and valuing yourself for the fact that you exist.

Share the following characteristics about power:

- Power exists in relation to other people: We often think about our power in comparison to another person. We may or may not have power, or we may have less or more power, in relation to another person or a group.
- Power also exists within us: We also have internal power that influences what we can and cannot do. As we become more aware of our inner potential and nurture it, we become empowered, and our relationships with others change.
- Power is not fixed: It is not something we have all the time. We constantly enter and exit situations and relationships in which we have more or less power.
- Positive and negative feelings: We often feel positive and in control when we feel powerful, and have negative feelings when we feel less powerful. This affects our ability to influence and act in a situation.

## NOTES FOR THE TEAM FACILIT AT OR

In some contexts, some participants, for cultural or other reasons, may feel uncomfortable with the proposed 'body sculpture' exercise. If so, you can hold a plenary session for groups to report back on the main points of their discussion in small groups, or you can prepare a drawing/image.

## 03 HOW DO WE LEARN VIOLENCE? ( C HI LDREN'S GAMES) (49)

## ACTIVITY ABOUT GENDER AND VIOLENCE  50

<!-- image -->

## TIME:

70 minutes

## OBJECTIVES:

1. Analyze  how  games  can  reinforce  gender  stereotypes and contribute to the internalization of power and violence as attributes of masculinity and submission and kindness as attributes of femininity.
2. Explore ways to raise boys equitably that break gender stereotypes  and  promote  children's  games  based  on cooperation, collaboration, and mutual respect.

Flipcharts

Masking tape

<!-- image -->

## PREPARATION

- Read the steps of the activity carefully.

## STEPS TO FOLLOW

## STEP 1:

## Brainstorming exercise

<!-- image -->

⏱ 15 minutes

1

Invite participants to name games they played as children or currently play as teenagers and young adults, explaining what each game is about. Write the game names on a flip chart, with three columns: one for games ONLY played by boys or girls, one for games ONLY played by girls or girls, and one for games played by both boys and girls.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Games that both boys and girls play

- Markers

2

## When participants can't think of more games, encourage reflection with the following questions:

- Why do we/did we play these games and not others?
- What do these games teach us/did they teach us about what it means to be a man and a woman?
- Which games are/were girls excluded from and which games were boys excluded from, and why?
- Which games did both boys and girls play, and why?
- Do we still see games divided by gender?
- What do boys' games have in common? What do girls' games have in common?

## STEP 2:

## Group Work

⏱ 20 minutes

1

Form single-gender groups with about 4 or 5 participants in each group. Invite each group to select a game from the list that they will practice and then play in front of the other groups. Make sure each group chooses a different game. Tell the groups to be imaginative and creative if they need specific materials for the game.

- Give the groups 10 minutes to practice their game. 2

## STEP 3:

## Plenary Session - Let's play!

⏱ 35 minutes

1

Invite each group to play their game in front of the others, instructing them to pay special attention to how the game is played and how the participants interact with each other during the game.

2

3

After each group demonstrates their game, encourage reflection and analysis with the following guiding questions:

- What caught their attention most about the game and why?
- Who was in charge/giving orders, and how did they do it?
- In what ways were cooperation and solidarity present during the game?
- In what ways were aggression and violence manifested during the game?
- Why is it so important for men to win and not lose? Is it the same for women?

Ask the people who just played the game:

- How did you feel while playing?

(This question can be directed at specific individuals, depending on their level and quality of participation during the game.)

When all groups have finished, prompt further discussion and debate using the following questions as a guide.

- What other feelings did you have while playing or watching the games?
- What factors affected the type of game you played and their influence on your personal development? (e.g., socioeconomic circumstances, rural/ urban setting, ethnicity, etc.)
- Why are children's games in particular laden with aggressive, competitive, and/or violent elements?
- Where does violence come from?
- Is it a natural instinct or a learned behavior?

## NOTES FOR THE FACILIT AT ION TEAM

- This exercise is extremely dynamic and  fun  for  the  participants ,  but don't  let  its  playful  nature  detract from the seriousness of the reflection and analysis it seeks to provoke. While playing,  make  sure  that  participants (especially  men!)  don't  become  so involved that they risk physically hurting  themselves  or  others  in  the group.
- If  you  think  this  is  about  to  happen, stop the game immediately and use that as a starting point to begin reflecting on and analyzing the game.

## AUDIOVISUAL RESOURCES

TO TALK ABOUT SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THE EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT:

I'll explain it to you with Claymation - Paola Guzmán Albarracín Case:

https:/ /youtu.be/XDGfQ1OLWks?si=enKes6QXNpSVvDhE

This activity can be done outdoors, if there is  a  patio  or  open  space available.

- Encourage participants to play the games as they did when they were children, without simulating how the game was played. It's important that they identify with the game and its objectives.
- Make sure  feelings  and  emotions are expressed freely.

## 04 LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX (51)

ACTIVITY ON GENDER, SEXUALITIES, AND SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS (SRHR)  52

<!-- image -->

TIME 30 minutes

## OBJECTIVES

1. Identify the characteristics of people we consider sexy.
2. Begin to talk about sexuality without shame or fear.

(51) Developed by P Welsh for Sonke staff training processes Gender Justice, South Africa, August 2013.

(52) For more activities and audiovisual resources on gender, health, and sexual and reproductive rights, see the digital appendix of  this toolkit: p.146

## MATERIALS

- Blank paper
- Writing Utensil
- Talking

## STEP TO FOLLOW

## STEP 1:

## Identifying what we consider sexy about others

⏱ 10 minutes

- Each participant thinks of a famous person or historical figure they consider sexy. 1

2

Write the name of the famous person or historical figure on a piece of A4 paper, followed by three characteristics of that person that make them sexy. (Allow 3 or 4 minutes for this.)

<!-- image -->

4

At the bottom of the page, write: 'The sexiest thing about me is…' (completing the sentence).

- Participants stick the paper to their chests and model around the room silently, reading each other's sexy characteristics of celebrities and allowing them to read theirs.

While they do this, 🎶🎵 ''Let's talk about Sex' 🎶🎵 by Salt and Pepper plays in the background (or 'I want your sex baby' by George Michael, or another youth contemporary song; this can make the activity fun).

- Music on cell phone or computer

## STEP 2:

## Share in the plenary

## ⏱ 20 minutes

1

## Gather the group and begin a discussion using the following questions as a guide:

- What caught your attention most about the chosen famous people and their characteristics?
- Which characteristics were most and least common? Why?
- Which characteristics do you think are positive/negative? Why?
- Who is generally considered to be sexy: women/girls or men/boys? Why?
- How do these characteristics contribute to or detract from a person's well-being?
- What do we mean by 'sexy' and 'sexuality'?

Finally, share the key message of the activity, linking it to what the participants shared.

## 05 HEALTHY AND UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS (53)

ACTIVITY ABOUT GENDER, RELATIONSHIPS AND VIOLENCE  51

TIME: 45 minutes

<!-- image -->

## OBJECTIVE:

Identify healthy and unhealthy attitudes and behaviors within romantic and romantic relationships.

## KEY MESSAGES

- Healthy relationships are based on respect, equality, shared responsibility, honesty, and happiness.

## MATERIALS

- Flipchart paper
- Markers
- Tape

## STEPS TO FOLLOW

## STEP 1:

## Brainstorming about healthy relationships

- ⏱ 15 minutes
- Introduce the activity by saying: 'Romantic relationships can be healthy or unhealthy. In healthy relationships, both partners are happy to be with each other. In unhealthy relationships, one or both partners are dissatisfied with the relationship due to one or more issues.' 1

2

Brainstorm with participants about the qualities that describe healthy relationships, writing their contributions on a flipchart. (Try to get participants to agree that respect, equality, responsibility, and honesty are some of these qualities.)

- Cards (or pieces of paper) with 'Healthy,' 'Unhealthy,' and 'It Depends'

## STEP 2:

## Work in pairs in plenary

## ⏱ 10 minutes

- Form pairs of participants. Give each pair three or four possible situations from the list below that can occur in relationships. 1

Ask the pairs to examine the possible situations they have been given, analyze them, and determine whether they fall into the 'Healthy,' 'Unhealthy,' or 'It depends' category.

Invite participants to come to the front of the room and place the cards with the possible situations they were given and assign what they think is most appropriate.

After all the cards have been placed, review each one and discuss with the entire group whether the possible situations fall into the 'Healthy,' 'Unhealthy,' or 'It depends' category. Allow for dialogue and discussion, as well as the sharing and analysis of different opinions and ideas.

## Notes for the f acilit ation t eam

If  you  don't  have  cards,  you  can simply  read  each  situation  aloud  to participants and ask them to determine whether  it  falls  into  the  'Healthy,' 'Unhealthy,' or 'It Depends' category. The main purpose of this activity is to define what is healthy and what is not.

When participants are divided on  this  issue,  return  to  the  qualities of a healthy relationship (respect, equality,  responsibility,  honesty,  and happiness) and see if they apply to the situation.
